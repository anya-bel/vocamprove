1,BEING DRAWN TO AN IMAGE,1
2,Guy Brett,1
3,"Why do certain images matter to one, and why is the desire to answer this question as involuntary as the response itself?",1
4,"Why does it seem important that the answer should have some ‘objective’ quality about it, an insight into history, society, knowledge, point to a merely personal obsession?",1
5,"The American film-maker Maya Deren says somewhere that ‘response should always precede analysis’, a remark which sounds it was made as an artist's challenge to academic dryness and formalism.",1
6,"But is not the response and the analysis actually part of the same phenomenon, whether it results in an exclamation (‘how beautiful! ') or a new ‘reading’?",1
7,"The recourse to books, documents, or sources, underscores a perception which is somehow already in the air.",1
8,The effort to recapture art's ‘history’ is always entangled with the desire to remake its identity and meaning as part of contemporary struggles.,1
9,"This article comes the familiar experience of being drawn to a particular image, or set of images, without knowing why, and the attempt to account for this feeling.",1
10,"Looking intermittently at the so-called colonial art of Latin America in churches, museums, private collections and books, I became magnetised by the figures of angels.",1
11,They are extraordinarily resplendent.,1
12,They have a material splendour in their dress.,1
13,The spiritual (or is it the psychic?) intensity of their presence goes together with a marvellous air of freedom and delicacy.,1
14,"They have a tendency to expand, to fill the picture space.",1
15,"If the angel is already a hybrid (a human with wings), the Latin American angels seem to incorporate further incongruities into this composite of the human and the supernatural which hints at further, latent meanings.",1
16,"I knew that these paintings were produced for the Spanish in the decades after their conquest of Latin America, and represented the christianising of the old centres of Inca culture, in Peru and Bolivia especially.",1
17,I knew that in the main they were painted by Indian and mestizo artists at the command of the Europeans.,1
18,"It lodged in my mind to try and answer the question whether there was something special about the depiction of angels in post-conquest art, and if so, what it could be.",1
19,I didn't make a systematic study but I occasionally followed up clues if I came across references in books and catalogues.,1
20,I soon learned that the theme of angels was one of the most popular in the paintings produced by indigenous artists for the complex iconographic programmes of the churches and missions established by the Spanish after the conquest.,1
21,This word ‘popular’ is problematic and will be returned to later.,1
22,All colonial painting began in a process of copying.,1
23,"Indian artists were obliged, or forced, to abandon their own forms of representation and learn the European way.",1
24,"But after a period of sheer copying, some themes took off.",1
25,Some developed differently in the American context.,1
26,Why did angels especially flourish?,1
27,"As I investigated further, it seemed to become clear that if this question could be answered it could only be in a complex way.",1
28,"These paintings, in other words, could only be read as the site of a complex play of forces.",1
29,They were not simply transcriptions of the power of the conquerors and the coercive force with which they attempted to annihilate the existing culture and beliefs of the Indians and impose Christianity.,1
30,"Nor, obviously, were they a simple expression of Indian resistance to this assault.",1
31,In some way they were both these things .,1
32,The more I looked into it the more the paintings seemed to go beyond simple unitary ideas of authorship and meaning.,1
33,The Peruvian art historian Luis Enrique Tord has written:,1
34,"The Spanish conquest of the Inca empire had a profound impact on many aspects of Indian society, but the most serious blows suffered by the Andean peoples were administered by the Church.",1
35,The efforts of priests and missionaries to eradicate the Indians' ancestral beliefs produced profound emotional disturbances great changes in their conception of the world.,1
36,"To enforce conformity to the new orthodoxy, the Spaniards instituted ecclesiastical , or inspections intended to extirpate the idolatory that persisted long after the conquest.",1
37,"In the sphere of art the range of subjects and genres permitted by the church was extremely narrow, only in fact religious paintings and portraits.",1
38,At that time after the conquest there was effectively no ‘thought’(recorded discourse) outside the religious framework and institutions.,1
39,"The first university in Peru, , was founded by the Dominicans.",1
40,"Painting was from the beginning one of the most important instruments of conquest in the sphere of thinking, the mind.",1
41,In the earliest years of their missionary efforts Dr Tord writes:,1
42,the friars discovered that the Indians were deeply impressed by sacred images created with the newest artistic techniques brought from the Old World…,1
43,"Those images were first seen in the catechisms, Bibles, books of hours, and hymnals used to convert the Indians and direct their worship.",1
44,"‘The Archangel Raphael’, by a follower of Luis de Riano, Cuzco School c. 1640.",1
45,"Oil on canvas, 65″ x 42″.",1
46,"Convento de San Francisco, La Paz.",1
47,"The Jesuits brought over their leading painter in Europe in the late sixteenth century, the Italian Bernardo Bitti, to live and work in Cuzco.",1
48,A school of painting grew up in Cuzco which became the leading centre of the production of paintings south of Mexico and exported paintings and painters to many other parts of the continent including remote areas.,1
49,"Leopoldo Castedo, the Spanish-Chilean art historian writes:",1
50,"Of forty-seven painters documented in Cuzco during the period, thirty-five were Indians, seven criollos or mestizos, four Spaniards, and one Italian.",1
51,This list does not include the great number of Indians who remained anonymous….,1
52,"The similes usually used to describe the hybrid produced over the years by the Cuzco painters — the ‘melding’, or ‘blending’, or the ‘intricate amalgamation’ of European and indigenous traditions to produce an art of ‘Byzantine richness and splendour’— obviously belies the violence of events.",1
53,"These phrases do, however, have the ring of truth in an aesthetic sense — or rather there was an aesthetic process involved which had to some extent its own story.",1
54,"This was manifested not only in the precise, artistic and critical response by Indian peoples to European paintings, but also in connoisseurship within the colonising ranks.",1
55,"A blossoming of the arts followed the rebuilding of Cuzco after the catastrophic earthquake of 1650, partly the arrival of Bishop Manuel de Mollinedo y Angulo.",1
56,"His collection included two El Grecos, and other outstanding Spanish pictures, and he sponsored Indian painters like Diego Quispe Tito, sculptors, architects and jewellers.",1
57,"Sometimes the coercion and oppression felt directly in the paintings: , in images of Saint Isidore, a rather obscure Spanish saint vastly amplified in the New World as the patron of labourers, who is shown to carry a small bag of coca leaves as the Indian peasants and miners did, and do, to chew to combat hunger and fatigue.",1
58,Castedo points this out.,1
59,He also shows that images of were often changed to .,1
60,"Indian painters would in this case be painting an image showing the Church's and the State's warning to Indians who contemplated rebellion, as many did.",1
61,"And occasionally, as, , during or around the time of the rebellion led by Tupac Amaru II in 1780, an image would appear of explicit resistance to colonialism.",1
62,"In the somewhat unlikely context of the Pelican History of Art (the relevant volume is ), an anonymous painting is described which shows America:",1
63,nursing Spanish noble boys.,1
64,"Negroes and mestizos are pressing around her throne, while nude Indian children weep abandoned.",1
65,Two richly dressed Indian couples present their gifts in a beautiful park crowded with different animals.,1
66,The legend says: Where in the world has one seen what one sees here…,1
67,Her own sons lie groaning and she suckles strangers.,1
68,"The images of angels are much more ambiguous and capable of different interpretations (this could, , be said of the angel theme generally as it recurs in the history of art, and in various guises across different cultures).",1
69,It is not hard to find documentary evidence for the Church's deliberate use of the angel theme as an instrument of conversion.,1
70,"The Bolivian art historian Teresa Gisbert writes that the Councils of Lima, which were responsible for questions of orthodoxy in the Viceroyalty: ‘sought to attract Indians to the new faith by the use of images which would be especially appealing to them.'",1
71,Why were angels appealing to them?,1
72,"In the Pelican History, Martin Soria tentatively puts forward the theory that angels were popular because ‘they replaced similar messengers in pre-conquest beliefs’.",1
73,Teresa Gisbert produces evidence to show that Diego Quispe Tito's series of paintings of the zodiac for the Cathedral of Cuzco was commissioned to counteract the traditional indigenous worship of the stars and were intended to aid in Christianising the Indians of the Andes.,1
74,"And she suggests that the angels, especially the series of angels, could have a similar purpose, to ‘replace worship of celestial phenomena with the theologically acceptable cult of the angels’.",1
75,"So apparently they were ‘popular’, for different reasons, with both Christian and native American, with oppressor and oppressed.",1
76,"It is you could read in them simultaneously transcriptions of inducement, threat, coercion, protection, solace, yearning and resistance.",1
77,Does this explain their complex expressivity?,1
78,"For the same quality can be interpreted differently one's point of view, one's experience, and one's feelings.",1
79,"can mean Defence of the Faith, i.e. of Christianity, or it can mean the adoption and identification of a ‘guardian spirit’, who will watch over your life-journey, a universal, but at the same time very individual and personal desire, expressed in most religions and cultures.",1
80,"Looking at the angel's image you can dream, ask for what you want.",1
81,"The angel, with its brilliantly opulent but light clothing, its mobility, its freedom from hierarchical placing in the pictorial composition, and its bisexuality, is an intimate image of enablement.",1
82,"Among the images of angels is a genre apparently unique to South America, even to the Andes, the Angels with Guns.",1
83,"This was also a very popular subject (one church inventory for 1748, , lists 36 pictures of armed angels).",1
84,"Julia P. Herzberg, who calls these pictures ‘representations of winged  beings military, aristocratic and religious, gives this explanation of their ",1
85,Paintings of angels with guns appeared at a time when the religious orders were confronted with the stubborn persistence of pre-conquest religion amongst their Indian charges.,1
86,"Immense problems remained not merely in the campaign to destroy Indian idols, but in teaching and reinforcing the principles of the new faith.",1
87,"Sermons and catechisms were the primary means of conversion, but images of angels with guns were useful symbols of important teachings of the church.",1
88,The Spaniards conquered the Incas with both the Cross and the arquebus.,1
89,The key to understanding the religious function of these images is found in the gun motif.,1
90,"Firearms, unknown to the Indians at the time of the conquest, seemed a frightening manifestation of the supernatural, for they ‘fled fear when there was a blare of trumpets, the roar of arquebuses and artillery’.",1
91,The firearm in an angel's hands must have had a powerful impact on Indian converts.,1
92,"But since guns were also used defensively, the images functioned symbolically as reminders of the protection offered to those who embraced Christianity.",1
93,The image of the angel with a gun served a secular a religious function by emphasising the lesson that the Church and the Spanish colonial régime were united in their goal to christianize the Indians.,1
94,The military aspect of the crusade is subliminally suggested by the gentle figure who handles his firing weapon in varied positions which recall those of a fighting force.,1
95,"In speaking about the angels' clothing, Herzberg continues:",1
96,Far more important than the military aspects of the angel's costumes are the explicit references to the high social status of both Spanish colonial gentlemen and Inca royalty.,1
97,"Richly brocaded fabrics, ribbons, and lace characterize the opulent viceregal dress of the 17th century.",1
98,"The gentlemen-aristocratic nature of angels with guns is defined by their elegant dress, which relates them directly to the ruling viceregal aristocracy.",1
99,A key phrase here seems to me to be ‘gentle figure who handles his firing weapon’.,1
100,"Although the technical military details of loading and handling the gun , of the angel paintings, is very precise — taken in fact from a Flemish military manual of 1607 — the ‘common soldier’ of the image in the manual is not retained: he becomes the gorgeous aristocrat.",1
101,"The non-aggressive angel-like  pose, is extremely seductive, which makes the threat of force oblique, only implied, a beautiful face was being laid over the ugly face of violent coercion.",1
102,"Are these pictures simply transcriptions of power, in which the hard approach is mixed with the soft, and the Church is allied with the State (and in this case hinting , not just at the foreigner's domination of the native inhabitants but also at class conflict within colonial society, since the angel is a mélange of Spanish and Inca aristocracies)?",1
103,Perhaps.,1
104,"But again they seem to me more enigmatic, more multiple — images full of aesthetic tensions.",1
105,"Can one again make a conflation between domination and rebellion in the image, an expression of both the Church/State and the Indian wishes?",1
106,Leopoldo Castedo writes:,1
107,The prestige of the armed archangel was and is still very great.,1
108,"In mestizo architectural decoration of the 18th century, the archangel brandishing the flaming sword had a prominent place (particularly fine examples are in the Cathedral of Puno and San Lorenzo, in Potosi); and in the traditional (Bolivian devil play), a religious drama, the Archangel Michael defeats […]the Devil of the Seven Masks.",1
109,"In 1950, in a curious or consistent coincidence ($, Pope Pius XII declared the Archangel Michael patron of police — a decision that may well diminish the archangel's prestige in Latin America.",1
110,"‘Archangel with Gun’, by an anonymous painter of the Cuzco School, early 18th century.",1
111,"Oil on canvas, 63 1/4″ x 39 1/2″.",1
112,"Museo de Arte, Lima.",1

117,"dealing, as I have been doing, with one of the major subjects and themes of Cuzco painting, an inventory could be made of ways in which painters departed from European models, or from academic notions of excellence.",1
118,"There are peripheral insertions, like borders of flowers, or tropical birds which populate the background landscapes of many religious paintings.",1
119,"Or survivals at the level of colour: liking for flat and intense colours, local earth and vegetable dyes, which may go all the way back to the ancient textile traditions that of the Paracas culture in Peru.",1
120,"Also, intensification of the colours in the angels' wings as compared with Europe.",1
121,These questions were not merely ‘academic’.,1
122,"Disputes among Spanish and Indian painters themselves, in some ways antecedents of all subsequent debates around ‘indigenism’, go back to the early days in Cuzco.",1
123,In 1688 the Cuzco guild of painters split.,1
124,The immediate reason seems to have been that Indian painters working for some of the Spanish and criollo masters complained of mistreatment.,1
125,The Spanish admitted their guilt but no agreement could be reached and the two sides moved apart.,1
126,The Spanish guild tightened its European rules of style.,1
127,"The Indian painters lost contact with European developments and, Teresa Gisbert, ‘sought inspiration both in the old styles and in their own tastes and traditions’, a mixture of ornamental stylisation with observation of the reality around them.",1
128,"Their religious pictures, she writes, ‘belong to an archaic world […$ who viewed the religious realm as something ‘different’ from mundane reality.'",1
129,"The argument so far has been intended to put forward the possibility that an art work or image could be official and coercive, and unofficial and subversive, all at the same time.",1
130,The example I have given is the only one that exists.,1
131,"The  same process has been documented in other situations where a people have been conquered, colonised and their cultural beliefs assaulted.",1
132,Eduardo Mondlane found that African carvers in nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century Mozambique had made their own use of Christian themes imposed by priests and missionaries:,1
133,"When a [makonde]sculptor departs from the stereotype […$ this is nearly always because an element of doubt or defiance has been worked into it; a madonna is given a demon to hold the Christ Child; a priest is represented with the feet of a wild animal, a pietà becomes a study not of sorrow but of revenge, with the mother raising a spear over the body of her dead son.",1
134,"Magazine advertisement, featuring a painting by Botero.",1
135,Such images may startlingly demonstrate the general truth that the meaning of a work cannot simply be equated with its subject.,1
136,"But particularly intriguing is the phenomenon of syncretisation itself, as an process, and its relationship to meaning: the process whereby something new is created that cannot simply be reduced to either side of two antagonistic forces, or returned to a former ‘purity’.",1
137,A new ‘in-between’ is created.,1
138,This is especially true in the context of Latin America where this kind of duality and fusion has been a feature of culture from the time of the conquest right today — both on the popular and the intellectual level.,1
139,"‘Latin America is such a syncretic, eccentric, disjointed fusion of European, Amerindian and Afro-Caribbean culture,’ in the words of the Mexican artist Guillermo Gomez-Peña.",1
140,"Or, as the Chilean painter Juan Davila recently put it: ‘You take something of yourself, something of the conqueror’.",1
141,In both cases these are intellectuals talking about their own work by linking it with a process continually taking place at a popular level and in everyday life.,1
142,"Today, the image of the angel is still alive, and still in contention; it has been merely consigned to the museum.",1
143,It is still a part of contemporary power struggles.,1
144,On the one hand it has appeared as a focus for resistance.,1
145,"The militant angel appeared, , in wall paintings in Haiti during the shortlived popular uprising for food and democracy of 1986.",1
146,"The extraordinarily effective popular figure of the masked Superbarrio, who emerged spontaneously to lead the movement to demand the provision of proper housing in the aftermath of the disastrous Mexican earthquake of 1986, surely appeals to memories of the angel-enabler, references to Mexican popular masked wrestling heroes and perhaps to Superman.",1
147,"At the same time, the armed angel is continually reproduced as a figure of folklore, a naive stereotype of Latin America, typically exploited in the paintings of Fernando Botero, the highest selling Latin American artist in the world today.",1
148,"His shallow humour trades in, but misses the actual drama and sensibility of that hybrid fusion of the aristocratic and the popular which took place all those years ago in Cuzco.",1
149,"Symbolic angel lances a Tonton Macoute on a mural in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, 1989.",1

153,"‘Popular culture is not what is technically called folklore, but the popular language of permanent historical rebellion.’",1
154,"This sentence, by the Brazilian film-maker Glauber Rocha, written at the turn of the 1970s, clearly identifies a form of expression with a mass of oppressed people whose experience has been continuous over four centuries.",1
155,And Glauber also implies that the forms and images in which this experience is expressed are not fixed but open and changing.,1
156,"The sentence comes from an essay called , an eccentric spelling of (‘Aesthetic of the Dream') in which, building on the idea that ‘the dream is the only right which cannot be forbidden’, Glauber Rocha described how he had come to realise the revolutionary importance of the mystical in Latin American popular culture.",1
157,"It was the only way of contesting that ‘bourgeois reason’ which, for him, was as much a feature of left-wing political programmes as it was of traditional colonial domination.",1
158,"In his 1965 article, ‘Aesthetic of Hunger’, enormously influential on Third World cinema and art, Glauber felt he had given ‘the measure of my rational understanding of poverty’.",1
159,"By 1971 he was saying that, as artists:",1
160,"We must touch, by communion, the vital point of poverty which is its mysticism.",1
161,This mysticism is the only language which transcends the rational schema of oppression.,1
162,"The role of the angel as an intermediary between the human and the mystical world, and its elaborate beautifying as a vehicle of the dream, would seem to tie in closely with Glauber's identification of a continuing thread of psychological resistance in Latin American culture.",1

164,‘HER DRESS HANGS HERE': DE-FROCKING THE KAHLO CULT,1
165,Oriana Baddeley,1
166,The 1990s have witnessed a shift in the art establishment's attitudes towards art produced its traditional parameters.,1
167,The work of previously marginalised artists has become an area of rich speculation among art dealers priced the ‘modern masters’ market.,1
168,"Almost every year has witnessed the discovery of new artistic terrain — graffiti art, Soviet art, Australian art, the art of Latin America.",1
169,The major auction houses have moved with the times and have found new ways of selling works which in both form and content would have proved an unstable investment a decade ago.,1
170,The current status of the work of the Mexican painter Frida Kahlo is a dramatic example of this change.,1
171,"Once known primarily as the wife of Diego Rivera, her reputation Mexico now far supercedes his: since 1919, sale room estimates of her work have risen from $40,000 to over $1 million, and in 1990 a work by Kahlo broke all records at Sotheby's New York for a Latin American artist.",1
172,The enormous rise in the economic value of her work has developed in tandem with the increased critical and popular response to her particular blend of naive style and incisive content.,1
173,"While the first wave of popular interest arose with the 1982 Whitechapel exhibition instigated by Laura Mulvey and Peter Wollen, it was the publication of Hayden Herrera's biography of Kahlo in 1983 which has led to her current cult status.",1
174,"Since that date she has been the subject of TV documentaries, a feature film (‘Frida’ by Paul Leduc), a stage play, numerous publications and the inspiration for designer clothing.",1
175,"In May 1989 magazine ran a 16 page feature on Frida Kahlo as the ‘spirit of Mexico’(Fig. 1), while in (Feb. 1990) there was a 10 page interpretation of ‘the romance of Frida Kahlo's Mexico’(Fig. 2).",1
176,"Almost as a logical outcome of this media blitz, it emerged in the summer of 1990 that Madonna, already a devotee of Kahlo's work, was commissioning a screenplay based on Kahlo's life.",1
177,"Almost as a logical outcome of this media blitz, it emerged in the summer of 1990 that Madonna, already a devotee of Kahlo's work, was commissioning a screenplay based on Kahlo's life.",1
178,", May 1989, p. 18–19.",1
179,"As with most artists who have become mythical personalities in the popular imagination, such attention has focused primarily on the anecdotal and tragic details of Kahlo's admittedly fascinating life.",1
180,"The passionate obsession with her husband Diego Rivera, her flamboyant appearance, but most of all her physical and emotional pain have come to dominate responses to her work.",1
181,"While Kahlo's art helped her to deal with the vicissitudes of her life, for most audiences it is her life story which allows access to her art.",1
182,"In this one can draw obvious parallels to the appeal of Van Gogh, a traditionally popular artist recently made fashionable by the media attention generated during the centennial of his death.",1
183,The archetypal dropout/spiritualist became an appropriate icon for the sixties revival of 1990's long hot summer.,1
184,"Yet despite the iconic status of Van Gogh's ‘tragic’ life, it is the appearance of his work by which he is ultimately signified, his thick impasto brush-stroke, his vibrant yellows, the urgency of his creative drive.",1
185,"In the case of Kahlo the popular image is of the artist herself, the characteristic brows, the elaborate hair, the Mexican costume (Fig. 3).",1
186,"It is primarily her appearance, not the formal language of her art, that has graced the pages of and magazines.",1
187,The feature transposed the ‘Kahlo style’ to Kahlo lookalikes in contemporary clothing balanced around segments of Herrera's biography of  the artist.,1
188,"In the later piece only the style remained as the far more overtly sexual, Kahloesque models lounged and pouted in their ‘Mexican’ interiors.",1
189,"There is a poignant irony in the way clothing, which on one level served to hide Kahlo's broken body, falls or is lifted by the model to reveal a luxuriantly perfect physique (Fig. 4).",1
190,The visual references in the two magazines are as much from photos of the artist her work.,1
191,"In both features she is also seen to embody a wider set of assumptions about Mexico itself; exotic, passionate, yet constantly struggling against pain and deceit.",1
192,"While and subsequently (Fig. 5), stressed different facets of Kahlo's public persona, they all shared the emphasis on ‘her’, as an encapsulisation of stereotypical images of Mexico, her work.",1
193,"It is her body as the canvas, her appearance as art.",1

198,", May 1989, p. 28.",1
199,", the line between art and life is a particularly hard one to draw in Kahlo's case.",1
200,The majority of her work is self portraiture; her aesthetic concerns grew from her fascination with the falsity of appearance.,1
201,"Dressing up, role playing and masquerade form the conceptual basis of Kahlo's work.",1
202,"In (1944)(Fig. 6), she paints herself wearing Rivera's suit, challenging traditional expectations of femininity and attempting to appropriate his authority (while simultaneously) threatening castration).",1
203,"More disturbingly, in (1945)(Fig. 7), she throws doubt on too straightforward a reading of her self-portraits as revealing of her inner emotions.",1
204,Where does the mask fall: Does not the ritual repetition of those familiar features ‘mask’ far more than it uncovers?,1
205,"There is, however, an inevitable logic to the appropriation of her meticulously constructed image, a process which the artist was mocking as early as 1933: ‘…some of the gringa women are imitating me and trying to dress ‘Mexicana’, but the poor souls only look like cabbages and to tell you the naked truth they look absolutely impossible.'",1
206,"The ‘impossibility’ stemmed from the failure of such followers to recognise the symbolic importance of Kahlo's choice of clothing, a failure also intrinsic to her recent magazine appearances.",1
207,"The particularities of post-revolutionary Mexico are frequently subsumed by the decorativeness of the ethnic, by the generalised attractiveness of the radical avant-garde.",1
208,"For Kahlo, however, choosing to don the costume of the Tehuana, example in (1946)(Fig. 8), was to embody a powerful icon of cultural identity.",1
209,"Mexican Indian dress is extraordinarily diverse and geographically specific, varying from region to  region.",1
210,The Tehuana dress is the most decorative variant or the closest to pre-Hispanic forms of clothing.,1
211,It is the mythology surrounding the women wearers of the costume which directed Kahlo's choice.,1
212,"The ostensibly matriarchal society of Tehuantepec led to the adoption of the Tehuana, in post-revolutionary Mexico, as the image of the strong Indian woman; the undefeated counterpart to the despised ‘Chingada’, who, conversely is the female embodiment of Mexico's hybrid post-conquest culture.",1
213,"In a culture where sexual metaphors are frequently used to convey racial and political conflict, the Tehuana represents that aspect of Mexico's indigenous tradition unbowed by centuries of colonial and male rule.",1
214,"Kahlo's adoption of Tehuana dress, while being an attractive disguise of what she saw as a less than perfect body, asserted both a feminist and an anti-colonialist position.",1

219,"In Kahlo's work there is a powerful mix of these discourses, yet her role as an archetypal woman painter has come to dominate responses to her work.",1
220,It is through her emergence as a cult painter of the feminist movement of the 1970s that her current reputation has evolved.,1
221,Her work almost perfectly illustrates debates the nature of traditional exclusions of a woman's art.,1
222,"The fascination with functions of the body, the analogies between artistic  and physical creative processes, self-portraiture used to reveal the female body as the site of patriarchal aesthetic discourse; all of these mirror the concerns of many women painters of the 1980s.",1

234,"In their formal language, Kahlo's works are exemplary of certain feminist arguments; the adoption of the decorative, the intimate and non-fine art mediums reveals the restrictive nature of traditional definitions of ‘high art’.",1
235,"This ‘appropriateness’ of Kahlo's aesthetic to contemporary debate has tended to remove her work from its historical context, to stress the collective and the cross-cultural.",1

237,"More problematic is the way in which such a dislocation has led to the acceptance of her ‘Mexicanness’ as mere decoration of the essentially feminist themes of her work, thereby defusing a substantial part of the art described by Breton as a ‘ribbon round a bomb’.",1
238,"It is the ribbon that runs through the pages of , the glossy surface of the images in direct opposition to a work Kahlo's (1939)(Fig. 9).",1
239,"In this painting, a memorial to a woman's tragic death is transformed into an indictment of the culture which destroyed her.",1
240,Hale's suicide became a poignant metaphor for the oppressive nature of the social values of New York and North America .,1
241,"The story behind Hale's death was one with which Kahlo obviously identified, and within which dress formed an important symbolic function.",1
242,"Before jumping from the window of her apartment, Hale had dressed meticulously in her most flattering dress, the corsage of yellow roses a gift from a male admirer.",1
243,"In Kahlo's painting, the figure falls from the fantasy world she has inhabited to the harsh bloodspattered reality of the street, literally coming down to earth.",1
244,"Hale's eyes stare knowingly at the viewer, a human sacrifice to an alienated and consumerist culture.",1
245,The horizontality of her fallen body is juxtaposed to the vertical thrust of the apartment building.,1
246,She leaps from an architectural monument to a phallocentric world.,1
247,"Although destroyed, she has also escaped.",1
248,"The painting, dedicated to Hale's mother, was commissioned by a mutual friend of Kahlo and Dorothy Hale, the managing editor of , Clare Boothe Luce.",1
249,The painting was agreed to by Luce to recompense for what she saw as her misjudgment of her dead friend.,1
250,"Having lent Hale money to pay her rent she had been angered to discover her spending enormous sums on an haute-couture dress, and refused to turn what, in retrospect, became Hale's farewell party.",1
251,Later it was revealed that the money had come from a different source.,1
252,"A male friend had tried to dissuade Hale from seeking a much needed job and had given her a thousand dollars to buy ‘the most beautiful dress in New York’, telling her that what she needed was to find a rich husband.",1
253,"On one level this work deals with a generalised ‘woman's experience’, yet the metaphorical power of Dorothy Hale's dress derives from Kahlo's use of clothing in her own self-portraits.",1
254,Dress not only covers and decorates the body but instils in the wearer its own characteristic strengths and weaknesses.,1
255,Hale's black velvet dress is cursed because it represents the values of the ‘Gringolandia’ so hated by Kahlo.,1
256,"In those paintings where Kahlo wears European dress she is passive, weak and unable to control her own destiny, but in the Tehuana costume she is strong, powerful, hopeful.",1
257,"Unclothed, her body becomes yet more vulnerable, but as Jean Franco states:",1
258,"The unclothed body is not a ‘self but a socialised body, a body that is opened by instruments, technologized, wounded, its organs displayed to the outside world.",1
259,"The ‘inner’ Frida is controlled by modern society far more than the clothed Frida, who often marks her deviation from the norm by defiantly returning the gaze of the viewer.",1
260,"Kahlo's naked body becomes not just the tortured self of her personal biography but a visual counterpart to the injured and defiled manifestations of Mexico's colonised past: La Llorona ‘the weeping woman’ of popular myth and La Chingada, the raped and abused mother described in Paz's .",1
261,"Descended from an Aztec mother goddess, Llorona is a long-suffering mother figure, symbolic in a wider sense of the trauma of the  Spanish invasion.",1
262,"Driven mad with grief by the loss of her child, she is thought to wander the streets weeping and crying out a ghostly memory of the pre-Conquest past.",1

273,On one level is a coda to (1932)(Fig. 11) of the previous year.,1
274,"This small painting on metal, in the style of a Catholic votive image, shows the artist poised between the technological inhumanity of a capitalist North America and the archaic fertility of Mexico.",1
275,Interwoven with these images are subtler references to the metaphorical borderlines which separate Latin American culture from that of Europe and North America.,1

307,Valerie Fraser,1
308,It is a truism to say that that which cannot be readily classified will tend to be overlooked.,1
309,"In Art History the rehabilitation of artists and bodies of work which have been overlooked has been going on since Vasari made such a good job of classifying Florentine art that all other art in Italy and beyond has had to be defined, until this century, and at some level even now, Vasari's classifications, or the model of stylistic evolution which he outlined.",1
310,"Non-Italian artists, non-Italian preoccupations, women artists, artists working in media Vasari's chosen painting, sculpture and architecture, non-Western art : critics have been busy reviewing such areas and, in so doing, producing new categories and classifications.",1
311,"Latin American art has been undergoing such a review both from within Latin America itself and from elsewhere, with several exhibitions and books on the subject in the last few years in Europe and the US.",1
312,That there should be an issue of the devoted to Latin American art is itself testimony to the success of such efforts.,1
313,But new categories can in turn prove to be exclusive.,1
314,Within the field of Latin American art as a whole there are still many individual artists who have not received the attention they deserve because their work does not seem to fit into any larger pattern.,1
315,"In the case of the work of the Mexican Alberto Gironella, the reason would seem to be precisely his insistent concentration on art of a very different category — that of Spain during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, particularly court portraiture.",1
316,"Among the more comprehensive books on twentieth-century Mexican art in recent years, Shifra Goldman only mentions him in passing, Luis Cardoza y Aragón says little more than that Gironella ‘escapes him’, and Ida Rodriguez Prampolini dismisses him from her discussion of Mexican surrealism as an ‘international’ artist, more closely related to Spain than to Mexico.",1
317,"When he has inspired sympathetic coverage, the results tend to be not so much an exposition of Gironella's achievements but belong to that particular branch of literature which uses works of art as a starting point for literary excursus.",1
318,"Octavio Paz's elegant essay is the prime example, where despite some insightful remarks he uses Gironella's work to make general observations about the creative role of the critic, , or for digressive flourishes on Spanish culture.",1
319,"When they met in Paris in 1963, Breton hailed him as a surrealist, but in a recent interview Gironella disclaimed so tidy a classification, saying he is as much a baroque artist as a surrealist.",1
320,"In fact, although there are both surreal and baroque elements in his work, Gironella prefers to call it mestizo’, a term which has often had negative, racist overtones but which has been acclaimed in this century, especially in Mexico, as a positive value, indeed distinguishing feature of Mexican culture: the rich and fruitful mixture of the European with the indigenous American.",1
321,"This rather simple notion, that there is one single Mexican culture, problematic principally because it tends to valorize the European over the indigenous and to ignore the diversity, and richness of the latter, but also, conversely, because it excludes or denigrates the more purely European aspects of the culture.",1
322,"Nevertheless it seems to me that Gironella is right, or that he is right he is using ‘mestizo’ to claim for his work a Mexican, not a European identity.",1
323,"He is probably also right when he says that he is only seen as a artist because his interest lies in Spanish art, in French art ‘like everyone else': in other words, within the accepted categories there is no room for a Mexican who is interested in Spanish art.'",1
324,My purpose in what follows is to try to place him within a Mexican context.,1
325,"Gironella's subject matter is the acclaimed artistic masterpieces of the Spanish past which he reworks in various ways, most dramatically into ironic altars assembled from a variety of painted, sculpted and ready-made elements (Fig. 1).",1
326,"Favoured subjects are court portraiture, and allegorical images of death, decay and the transience of life, usually handled with the blackest of black humour.",1
327,"Favoured artists are Goya and his predecessors in the Golden Age —— El Greco, Pereda, Valdés Leal and above all Velázquez.",1
328,"It is worth emphasising that the period spanned by the lives of El Greco and Velázquez saw in Latin America the consolidation of colonial government and of the Christian church, the establishment of the Spanish language and of European culture, the introduction of new methods of exploitation of people and resources.",1
329,"Goya's life, on the other hand, coincides with the decline and ultimate collapse of the Empire; Spanish rule in America had been overthrown by the time of his death in 1828.",1
330,"In other words, these artists lived during American's formative years.",1
331,"the work of the artists who interpreted their historical reality canvas, but the importance in Latin America of the art itself should not be underestimated, particularly the iconography of the monarchy.",1
332,"Velázquez's name, , would have been familiar to very few Mexicans in the seventeenth century, but as the only artist authorised to execute likenesses of the King his official portraits of Philip IV and the innumerable engravings after them would have been well known.",1
333,"A painting by his contemporary, Juan Bautista Maino,, of 1635, represents the recapture of the harbour of Bahia in Brazil (then under Spanish control) from the Dutch in 1625.",1
334,"(Fig. 2) While an injured man is tended in the foreground, the Dutch forces to the right kneel in homage before an allegorical tapestried portrait of Philip IV.",1
335,"This is a highly unusual painting in a number of ways, not least because no such royal portrait could ever have existed, including as it does, and on almost equal status with the king, the figure of his ambitious minister the Count-Duke of Olivares.",1
336,"Nevertheless, on special occasions the Spanish authorities in America would certainly have erected large representations of the king in this manner, as objects of semi-religious devotion.",1
337,On the death of a member of the royal family elaborate catafalques were constructed in cathedrals throughout the Empire and the deceased mourned in effigy.,1
338,Paintings and prints were distributed to colonial officials for display in much the same way as British embassies are provided with an official photographic portrait of the Queen.,1
339,"In other words, the focus of Gironella's attention is neither historically nor iconographically arbitrary, although in some ways his reworkings of the paintings of others could be seen to be simply an extension of a fairly conventional activity.",1
340,"Within the Western tradition of art we tend to take it for granted that much can be learned from the study of the art of the past and, traditionally, copying from the works of the Great Masters was one of a young student's most important tasks.",1
341,"This activity, this dependence on the art of the past, is not, in itself, ideologically highly-charged.",1
342,"Reynolds may have admired and borrowed from Michelangelo, and while this could be said to represent, perhaps, a long-standing tradition of cultural domination — or the domination in England of the Italianate tastes of the English upper classes — it would be a mistake to make too much of this.",1
343,In the case of Latin America it is more complex.,1
344,"Historically the relationship between Latin America and Europe is not only one of cultural domination of the former by the latter, but of political and economic domination.",1
345,"While the obvious colonial ties have been broken, the power still lies elsewhere.",1
346,"The sources of domination have in some ways simply broadened to include the US, japan, and international capitalism.",1
347,"Within the art world the problem remains that the production of art in Latin America, from a student's training to the art market, is rooted firmly in the European tradition, while to compound the difficulties, few Latin American museums can boast any examples of European, North American or even non-national art .",1
348,"Everything conspires to exacerbate the situation: conventional art education teaches an art-historical line of descent through the successive achievements of the Great Masters, but such works are unavailable in Latin America except in the form of often poor-quality reproductions.",1
349,In this sense things have not changed much since the seventeenth century.,1
350,Gironella always seems acutely aware of these issues.,1
351,"For him the reworking of familiar images is not simply a matter of drawing attention to the way in which mass-reproduction numbs the optic nerves, by shocking the spectator with a moustached Mona Lisa, but rather, using a peculiar blend of both iconoclasm a sort of wry homage, of investigating the power of certain images, particularly those which have national resonance.",1
352,"In this sense his Habsburg and Bourbon portraits are not dissimilar to Jasper Johns' American flag series, except that the flag, whatever individuals may think of it, is unquestionably American, the lineage is clear.",1
353,"The connecting threads between the Spanish  monarchy and colonial Mexico, between Spanish artists and Mexican, between past and present, are tangled or broken.",1
354,"Within Spanish art itself, on the other hand, the line is almost too simple: Goya was intensely aware of Velázquez, Picasso of both, Gironella the problem is not just that Picasso could be seen to have inserted himself into the next place in the sequence but that as a Mexican an unequivocal position in any such art-historical lineage is utterly unattainable.",1

358,Gironella was born in Mexico City in 1929.,1
359,His rather was Catalan; he had come to Mexico as a young man and worked in his brother-in-law's grocery shop.,1
360,"He later set up his own business importing groceries from Europe, particularly from Spain.",1
361,"His mother was Yucatecan, a mestiza from Mérida, but she was ‘catalanised’, as Gironella put it, by his father and grandmother; in other words a jointly Eurocentric upbringing, but, perhaps significantly, without personal contact with Europe until his first visit to Paris in 1960.",1
362,"He absorbed European culture through nineteenth-century French novels, and through the literature of sixteenth and seventeenth-century Spain, the Spanish cultural Golden Age.",1
363,"His major literary enterprise, as a student at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma in 1951, was the invention of a bad Golden Age poet whom he named Tiburcio Esquirla.",1
364,His later artistic inventions display the same fascination with the possibilities of getting inside the skin of another era.,1
365,"Through his efforts in this direction he effectively mocks much that is dear to scholars, historians, literary critics and art historians, especially the concept of a clear chronological sequence: his answer to the problem of how a Mexican can ‘belong’ to the dynasty of European art is, , to invade it retrospectively.",1
366,The decisive move from literature to painting came in 1952.,1
367,"Gironella seems to have been very confident about the change, as in the same year he was instrumental, together with Vlady and Héctor Xavier, in establishing a new art gallery in Mexico City, the Galeria Prisse.",1
368,"This quickly emerged as one of the most avant-garde of the new Mexican galleries, and the locus of a group of young artists, including José Luis Cuevas, who ‘with no fixed programme and no common plastic language,[…]were united only by the desire for change’.",1
369,"Their discontent at this time was principally with the social realism of the muralist school but, even at this early date, there was unease with the propaganda emanating from the US that Abstract Expressionism was  the only possible alternative.",1
370,"Gironella's solution was entirely individual: to focus on the art of the European past, looming large as it did in Latin American consciousness regardless of how often it had been declared dead and buried by Europeans.",1

374,"His artistic career began with a series of paintings based on the thirteenth-century sculpture of the elegant countess of Uta on the façade of Naumburg cathedral, a photograph of which had been lent to him by the young artist Vlady, but in the late fifties he turned his attention to Spanish art.",1
375,"His early choice of subject set the tone for his later work —— Goya's Queen Maria Luisa, and Velázquez's portrait of the dwarf Francisco Lezcano (Fig. 3)— in other words, great Spanish artists' handling of their arrogant, ugly, bizarre or idiotic sitters.",1
376,"He subjected both to repeated analysis, ending up with a version of Maria Luisa in which she is transformed into a sharp-beaked, staring owl, and of Francisco Lezcano in which he has metamorphosed into a dog.",1
377,"In both, Gironella is exploring the characters of the sitters as suggested in their portraits the formal, painterly qualities.",1
378,"Is Velázquez's Francisco Lezcano simple-minded, or is his expression one of aloofness and distance?",1
379,"Gironella has said he was drawn to this painting because Lezcano is holding some playing cards, so his disconcertingly direct gaze is inviting us in to test our wits and/or our luck against him.",1
380,"Queen Maria Luisa, wife of Charles IV, an unlovely, clever, deceitful and immensely powerful woman, is metamorphosed into a barn-owl, a , a word which in Spanish also means an ugly hag or a procuress.",1
381,Gironella's first direct encounter with Velázquez was at an exhibition of his work at the Metropolitan Museum in New York in 1959.,1
382,"Amongst the works on view was the one to which he has returned most often — the portrait of Queen Mariana of Austria, second wife of Philip IV, painted in 1652 (Fig. 4).",1
383,This painting has become a veritable obsession and he has returned to it repeatedly over the past thirty years.,1
384,"It is a full-length portrait showing the young queen very formally dressed, in a stiff conventional pose, looking out at the spectator.",1
385,"She wears a gigantic wig decorated with feathers and red bows, the shape of which echoes that of the wide skirt.",1
386,"One arm rests on the farthingale of the skirt, the hand very delicately holding a large white scarf; the other hand rests on a chair back.",1
387,"In the earliest versions, which date from 1959 — 60, Gironella turns her into a sort of rag doll; perhaps never more than a well-dressed shell, she is now simply a collage of fragments of coarse, torn cloth that appear to be pasted  down with thick smears of paint (Fig. 5).",1
388,"These early half-length versions, like close-up details of the original, also investigate compositional qualities, the slight angle of the torso to the picture plane and the relationship of head and wig to shoulders, emphasising features which are to become increasingly fetishised in subsequent renderings — the massive wig, .",1
389,"And in the second version he introduces a three-dimensional hand not, as in the Velázquez with the fingers straight and limp, but drawn up into an uneasy gesture, that claws at her skirt rests against it.",1
390,"The hand and the wig are to become identifying features, often used in isolation or elements from other pictures.",1

399,"In this full-length version Gironella places her square to the picture plane, a crucial adjustment which changes the tone from that of the formality of the original into one of helplessness.",1
400,"Moving from her external trappings to her internal structure, he represents her as a sort of wooden skeleton.",1
401,"At her breast, a gold rosette, she wears a brass bell and a series of wheels and cogs, apparently parts of an old-fashioned, manually operated lift.",1
402,She is like a mechanical musical doll that will perform a ponderous dance when someone turns the dial.,1
403,She is also black.,1

417,"In one version, the space beneath the seat contains a small, stuffed cayman and, as this is the equivalent of the space beneath her skirts, there are obvious psycho-sexual overtones.",1
418,"In another there is in fact no seat as such, rather like a monk's misericord, a chair that is not a chair (Fig. 7).",1
419,Again her heart is represented by the mechanism from an old lift: she goes up and down as others will her.,1
420,The origins of Gironella's peculiar assemblages lie in his childhood.,1
421,"His earliest memories are of stacks of colourful imported tins, boxes, bottles and packets of the family grocery business, and of the paraphernalia of popular Catholicism, which would have included reliquaries and tabernacles, retables combining paintings and sculpture, altars decorated with damask cloth, candles, flowers and of an often intensely personal nature.",1
422,He recalls building himself private altars of chocolate wrappers and tin cans.,1
423,"The packaging of imported products has continued to fascinate him, for intrinsic qualities —— the names, the colours and the designs — but also the way products from far away have been integrated into the domestic Mexican environment.",1
424,"Such products are known by the general term , ‘from across the ocean’, and to emphasise that Mariana herself is also an , she is often accompanied in Gironella's tableaux by tins of sardines.",1
425,"There are connections here too with Spanish Golden Age painting which, as Gironella himself has observed, often looks very .",1
426,The picaresque literature of the period is also very preoccupied with food and drink.,1
427,"But it is not just the strong smells of food, but the metaphorical smells of corruption and moral and social decay which are suggested by the inclusion of such items in his work.",1
428,"And where the tins of fish are juxtaposed with fragments of Mariana's body the evocation is also of death and putrefaction, perhaps also of coarse jokes about the distinctive ‘fishy’ smell of vaginal secretions.",1
429,Gironella's choice of Veláquez's Mariana as the basis for so many of his works is worth considering in more detail.,1
430,"First, to develop the idea of the punning associations already referred to the term , there is the pleasing assonance between the name of this earthly Queen Mariana, and that of Maria, Queen of Heaven.",1
431,"The Virgin has always been more popular than Christ in the New World; indeed in the sixteenth century certain churchmen had argued that while the East was the domain of Christ, the newly discovered West was that of his mother.",1
432,"Once in America, however, Maria soon fragments into numerous different Marias, each with her own distinctive attributes.",1
433,"In Mexico, during the Wars of Independence the Virgin of Guadalupe protected the nationalist forces while the Spaniards placed their trust in the Virgen de los Remedios.",1
434,"Gironella's many versions of Velázquez's Mariana similarly fragment her into different roles — queen, woman, icon, cadaver, carnival figure, victim, aggressor.",1
435,"There is a third sister in this euphonious family: Marina, the baptised name of Malinche, mistress of Cortèz, through whose good offices and linguistic skills Mexico was conquered both for the Virgin Maria, and for Marina's royal ancestors.",1
436,"Marina is the original and ultimate traitor to her people, but as mother of the first mestizo she is also the mother of modern Mexico.",1
437,Mariana herself is remembered more as a name on a family tree than as a person.,1
438,"Wife of Philip IV, she was also his niece; she had been betrothed to his son Baltasar Carlos but on his death at seventeen the King (her uncle) married her himself, and the only surviving son of this union was the cretinous Charles II, last of the Habsburg line.",1
439,"She is also remembered because she was painted by Velázquez, although this is not unrelated to the family tree.",1
440,"Velázquez shaped the public image of this family for his own and for all subsequent generations, investing them with an extraordinary pictorial power and stability.",1
441,"His portraits must in turn be considered an important constituent in their power, as compensation for their more corporeal weaknesses.",1
442,"With hindsight it perhaps seems strange that one of the indisputably greatest figures in the whole of Western art devoted the better part of his life to sell-advancement, and to painting the King, his family, and their attendant dogs, dwarves and sycophants Certainly the irony of this, together with the fact that this inbred family of often considerable mental physical fragility should have controlled the destiny of so vast an empire, is not lost on Gironella.",1

446,"We can read into such a view of the Habsburgs (Fig. 8): Philip IV and Mariana are merely reflections, living in a world of grotesquerie and make-believe; a tiny princess dressed as an adult with a skirt so stiff it makes her look she is on wheels, surrounded by curtseying maids, a dwarf, a midget, a huge dog with the ability to sleep through anything, and a great artist, aloof and all-powerful.",1
447,"Such a view is anachronistic, but this is exactly the attraction of Gironella's reworkings — he can present us with shifting visions of the art of the past, from within and from without, exploiting contrary responses, period eye innocent eye.",1

474,"The word in Spanish, as in English, evokes different ideas:colonial, el yugo matrimonial and , the colonial yoke, and the yokes of marriage and of the church, and all of these are implied here.",1
475,"Mariana is yoked in an arranged marriage to her uncle, Philip IV; she, as representative of the Spanish crown, is also a representative of the colonial and religious yokes which bound Mexico to Spain.",1
476,"The motif of the yoke was originally the emblem of Isabella of Castile, Mariana's distant predecessor, who had been responsible for sending Columbus on his first transatlantic voyage in 1492; in other words she had been responsible for initiating the whole colonial process (Fig. 12).",1
477,In the present century the combined emblems of Isabella's yoke (for Ysabella) and her husband Ferdinand's arrows () were expropriated by the Falangists in an attempt to claim some historical legitimacy.,1
478,"In other words, verbally and visually the emblem of the yoke has strong resonances in Spain and Mexico.",1
479,"But it is important that here the yokes are inverted: Mariana and the ties with Spain she represents have been transformed, translated into Mexican, into the  complexities of the mestizo Mexican present.",1
480,"She is an essential but individually helpless cog in the colonial machine; she is pinned out like a pre-columbian sacrificial victim, bruised and blood-stained; she is a religious icon, like a popular image of the Virgin Maria; she is a mannikin from some popular religious festival.",1

488,It is worth stressing the differences between Gironella's treatment of the art of the Spanish past and that of Picasso.,1
489,"Picasso's extensive series of variations on was produced in 1957, but Gironella knew of them when he himself began to work on versions of Velázquez (which is highly unlikely, as Picasso's paintings were not exhibited until 1959); their interest in the art of the past at that point in their careers was for both, perhaps, a rejection of abstraction; and both can in some way be defined as exiled from their Spanish roots, as outsiders looking in —— yet the results are widely divergent.",1
490,"Picasso's paintings are principally explorations of, or developments of matters internal to the light, the perspective, the angle of Mariana's head, the bobbing handmaids, echoed, , in the paintings of pigeons bobbing on his window sill, .",1
491,"In one version, , the odd position of Nicolas Pertusato's hands is rationalised by the addition of a piano.",1
492,Gironella is far removed from such light humour.,1

494,"Gironella is also interested in the formal qualities of these works, but it is the subject matter, the content, which really holds his imagination.",1
495,"Drawn to the fact-is-stranger-than-fiction aspects of Spanish history, Gironella found in Veláquez's portraits a perfect starting point for a detailed investigation of the contradictions which go to make up modern Mexico.",1
496,"His preoccupations are unusual (if not unique, as he claims) but they are unquestionably engendered by the search for a cultural identity which lies behind so much of Latin America's greatest artistic and literary creations.",1
497,"Ambivalence towards European culture, doubts about the possibilities of finding an authentic voice, a restless search for confidence and self-esteem, these are among the many bitter fruits of colonial rule in Latin America.",1
498,"In 1921, Siqueiros had urged artists to ‘avoid those lamentable archaeological reconstructions’(‘Indianism’, ‘Primitivism’, ‘Americanism') but he had also warned against the use of ‘archaic motifs’ from the old masters of European art ‘which for us would be exotic’; instead his advice was to study the arts of both, learning from the ‘constructive base’, the ‘great sincerity’, of the latter, and the ‘synthetic energy’of the former, to combine the ‘lost values’of the past with new values to produce an art appropriate to modern America.",1

505,"What is it that makes this substantial book produce, mixed-in with its rewards and knowledge, a depressing effect?",1
506,Does it matter?,1
507,"Callinicos' own apology about publishing yet another study of an over-worked subject notwithstanding, it remains an important contemporary debate.",1
508,It isn't that; the more so since Callinicos' contribution contains a significantly original dimension.,1
509,Despite its fashionable subject the book is in no sense routine.,1
510,"Uncritical testimonials to the postmodern's attractions are ten a penny, and conservative denunciations thereof not much scarcer.",1
511,"This study has the distinction of being both critical and radical, essentially turning the tables on advocates of the postmodern and reading their rhetoric as symptomatic of a conservative milieu's interests in a period of overall stagnation.",1
512,"It is ‘’ unlikely that Callinicos' criticism will cut much ice with those whose substantial career investments lie in one or another of the postmodern's corners: movementist politics, the radical academy, post this-ism and that-ism, a variety of well-upholstered ‘dissenting’niches from both the dominant culture and traditional opposition to it.",1
513,Too much is at stake for a book dedicated to proving the continuing value of classical Marxism to dislodge them.,1
514,"Maybe this is one reason for depression, then: that the book's well-wrought arguments will not exercise those whose ideology it dissects.",1
515,This indeed has already happened.,1
516,"Callinicos' Marxism has been repelled from the ramparts of pluralism for being…well, Marxist.",1
517,"It leads to the Gulag, you know, and is patriarchal (translation: Marx had a beard).",1
518,"Callinicos' book is difficult, and given the probability that despite the seriousness of its argument it is unlikely to be widely debated, I will firstly offer an interpretation of what I think its main themes are, and what they are not.",1
519,"In the first place, as the title makes plain, if offers a searching criticism of the claim that we are living in a postmodern epoch, and the consequence of that claim, that the culture and politics appropriate to such an epoch are structurally different from those of the preceding — and now past — Modern one.",1
520,"Callinicos' criticism of the ‘postmodern’ hypothesis contains a range of emphases, the three principal ones of which are: First: advocates of the postmodern in art (which attains uncommon prominence the ‘postmodern’is powerfully underwritten by a claimed distinction from Modernism), tend to misread the modern and arrogate its defining characteristics to their own period.",1
521,"The main ones of these are: the ordering concept of ‘doubling’—— double coding, the laying of one text over or against another; the relationship to historical codes of representation; and the relationship to popular codes of representation.",1
522,"Callinicos is able to set the claims of such postmodern advocates as Charles Jencks and Linda Hutcheon against an analysis of Modernism (predicated largely on that of Eugene Lunn) to demonstrate that the latter is more complex its characteristic conceptions of the subject, expression, reflexion etc, than the former are wont to have it.",1
523,"This is so to the extent that the claim for a structurally distinct postmodernist mode of signification breaks down in the face of a variety of historical avant-garde practices ranging across Europe from London to Vienna and Moscow in the hands of Eliot, Joyce, the Cubists, Surrealists and others (including, somewhat surprisingly, Kokoschka).",1
524,"A further set of more qualified — or less wholesale — more ambiguous claims are then encountered, by authors Lyotard, Jameson and Lash.",1
525,These include: the postmodern as a tendency within the modern; a notion of the ‘sublime’ and postmodernism's related freedom from dependence on the concept of totality; a distinction between the postmodern conceived the externalised and impersonal a view of the modern as characterised by the internal and ‘impressionist’; and a claim that it is the characteristic of the postmodern to signify figurally discursively (?).,1
526,"Callinicos' conclusion to these arguments is that despite their efforts, built around a claimed contrast of the postmodern either with or within Modernism, these authors have produced only ‘mutually and often internally inconsistent accounts’ of the ‘postmodern’, manifesting an ‘inability to come up with a plausible and coherent account of its distinguishing characteristics’(p. 28).",1
527,"It is in fact Callinicos' later claim that, occupying a qualitatively distinct position, ‘late capitalist culture represents a continuation of trends operative throughout this century’(p. 53).",1
528,"The second main emphasis of Callinicos' critique is aimed at the philosophy most frequently regarded as underpinning claims for the distinction of a postmodern culture, viz. poststructuralism.",1
529,"Drawing on  his own previous work, that of Dews and Habermas, the main thrust is initially to connect both ‘wings’ of poststructuralism — the ‘textualist’strand associated with Derrida, and the ‘contextualist/historical strand identified principally with Foucault — to the Nietzschean philosophical tradition; and then to isolate the most common problems attributed to that tradition to which,, post-structuralism succumbs.",1
530,"These concern: the subject; the issue of how critical resistance to dominant codes ever develops in the absence of an adequate conception of the subject; and, perhaps most fundamentally, the traditional problem facing any philosophy seeking to reduce knowledge to interests , of using rational argument to prove the limits on rationality.",1
531,"This is the densest, yet at the same time one of the most persuasive sections of the book, wherein a variety of arguments drawn from the analytic tradition are deployed against Nietzsche's lineage: Quine and Davidson on a theory of meaning both holistic and realist — demonstrating that there are more ways atomism and the myths of the given than Saussure's; and an anti-relativist notion of truth as a ‘regulative ideal’ derived from Tarski, Popper and Lakatos.",1
532,"There is no space here, central though it is to Callinicos' argument as a whole, to do note how this perspective is then deployed not only to counter poststructuralism but also significantly to modify the position of its main critic, Habermas.",1
533,"If Foucault and Derrida are taken to task for their Nietzschean lineage, Habermas' main weakness is deemed to lie in his Kantianism, manifest in a formalist ‘metaethics’, and his conception of ‘communicative rationality’ grounded in the consensual account of meaning offered by speech-act theory — and as such likewise vulnerable to Davidson, as well Wittgenstein.",1
534,"In essence then, at this philosophical level, Callinicos is marrying historical materialism and analytical philosophy, Marx and Wittgenstein, to defeat a range of new and old Idealisms: principally that tradition, dismissive of Enlightenment rationalism, descending from Nietzsche via Heidegger to a bathetic end in Lyotard and Baudrillard.",1
535,"Compelling as it is, however, this strategy does not form the conclusion of Callinicos' case.",1
536,The third main emphasis in his critique of the concept of the postmodern is to attempt to explain the hold exercised by a demonstrably deficient theory of culture and its dependence on a fundamentally irrationalist philosophy: which is to say he offers a politics of the postmodern.,1
537,"There are two pillars to this account: the emergence in the post-war period, and more particularly in the last two decades, of a mass social layer analysable under the rubric of a new middle class — though internally much differentiated distinct from a traditional petite bourgeoisie its structured ‘overconsumptionism’.",1
538,"And secondly, the defeat of the last major challenge to the system associated with the overdetermined name of ‘1968’ but finally petering out in the mid-1970s.",1
539,"The latter is primary; the emergence, or acceleration, of the former a consequence of measures adopted by newly confident conservative states to cope with the re-entry of the world system into a succession of capitalist crises after the exhaustion of the Long Boom.",1
540,"This kind of argument reads well in Callinicos' hands, but it is worth reminding ourselves of the unattractive reality to which it bears witness.",1
541,A real tragedy has taken place.,1
542,"If one only takes educational institutions universities and colleges, the world outside, the emancipatory impulse of the sixties and early seventies has been turned .",1
543,"What began as a compelling rejection of a straitjacketing orthodoxy made its criticism a materialist demand that the socio-political locale of culture be addressed, in the face of an institutionalised aversion to any such examination conducted under a self-serving misrepresentation of the autonomy of art.",1
544,This stance has now been inverted by a puritanical moralising clerisy which virtually polices conduct and enquiry in the name of a postmodern triptych — as Terry Eagleton has put it — of class and race and gender.,1
545,"What amounts to a fear of art, perpetrated under a false rhetoric of care and defence of the marginalised now dominates everything this oxymoronic ‘radical orthodoxy’ touches.",1
546,And it touches a lot.,1
547,"Making all due allowance for the return of historical tragedy as farce, watching this soporific monolith of the virtuous rise the debris of a liberating movement is akin to nothing witnessing Bureaucracy emerge from the ashes of Revolution.",1
548,"It is one of Callinicos' main concerns to relate the constellation of ideas and cultural practices trading under a conception of the postmodern condition to an inadequate and escapist politics: the claim, as one of his own critics has had it, that ‘the conditions that sustain oppression can be altered piecemeal’(Patton, cited, p. 85).",1
549,Callinicos mordantly comments on the descent ‘from revolutionary groupuscule to single-issue campaigns and then to social democracy’.,1
550,"In sum then, while acknowledging the stature of some elements of this constellation, the historical aspects of Foucault's work or the critical élan of Fredric Jameson (not to mention the giant figure of Habermas), Callinicos develops a root and branch assault on claims for the cultural distinction of the ‘postmodern’, for the conceptual adequacy of its theoretical base, and above all for the deleterious political consequences of adherence to it.",1
551,"So far so good; or one might almost say, so unproblematic.",1
552,"Callinicos mobilises as powerful a body of argument and evidence as is readily conceivable against a variety of contemporary critics and theorists whose claims he sees, with justice, as a .",1
553,Thus far there is something almost conventional about the book's stance.,1
554,"It is possible — just — to imagine a relatively orthodox artist, critic or historian appreciating the demolition of postmodernism (if not the evidence of late capitalism's corruption and decay).",1
555,But this is the argument's main thrust; and it is this rather elusive second aspect which gives the book its definitive character.,1
556,"‘Elusive’ isn't quite the word, however.",1
557,It is more a matter of approaching the book's arguments from within a milieu of relatively academic contemporary art theory and being unable to see the wood for the trees.,1
558,"For the concomitant of Callinicos' critique of postmodernism is not, as it would be in half a hundred other cases, the defence of modernism.",1
559,"For one thing, Callinicos goes his way to establish that the intellectual tradition he is concerned to critique is itself most fruitfully read, not as an articulation of a qualitatively new postmodernism, but an instance of a Modernist-type response.",1
560,"Thus: ‘poststructuralism […$ the philosophical expression of Modernism, whose characteristic themes were indeed announced by Nietzsche’(p. 6); Nietzsche's ‘system of ideas’ is ‘in many respects a philosophical articulation of the main themes of Modernism’(p. 67).",1
561,"Callinicos is concerned to give weight to the proposition advanced by Franco Moretti Carl Schmitt, that it is not the task of Marxism to defend Modernism its devices were ‘inherently subversive of the existing social order’(p. 48).",1
562,"The point is that for Callinicos, Nietzschean thought is an instance of Romantic anti-capitalism: that form of refusal of the implications of capitalist modernity which has been present virtually since the birth of that condition, described by Michael Lowy as ‘opposition to capitalism in the name of pre-capitalist values’(cited p. 67).",1
563,"The consequence of this is that Modernism too must be a form of romantic anti-capitalism, and as such one-sided and vulnerable.",1
564,"The principal weakness of both the modernist tradition proper, and indeed of Nietzsche himself is, for Callinicos, their aestheticism.",1
565,It is as well to be clear on this.,1
566,"Callinicos' defence of classical Marxism, of historical materialism, is in the first instance deployed against a postmodernism which has come to proclaim the death of the grand narrative of emancipation and the need for a new form of politics not constructed along the lines of the traditional left.",1
567,"This defence of Marxism carries over, however, to a critique of Modernism itself: not merely for the fact that Nietzsche attaches ‘importance’ to art but for the further claim ascribed to him, and therefore to Modernism itself, that ‘the nature of aesthetic experience contains the form of understanding proper to the world itself (p. 66).",1
568,"In the end, , Callinicos pits historical materialism against not merely postmodernism but, following the logic that the latter is indistinguishable from Modernism properly conceived, against Modernism itself.",1
569,"Drawing largely on the Marshall Berman/Perry Anderson debate, and thereby making of Modernism the characteristic expression of the experience of modernity, itself conceived as a response to capitalist modernisation, Callinicos seems to want to claim in essence that both the former are partial the fact of this last.",1
570,"Weber's conceptualisation of the modern as a process of structural differentiation is, I think, seen to be echoed in Modernist claims for the specificity of art.",1
571,"Both are then held to be deficient Marx's conception of a ‘mode of production’which differentiation can be understood, made intelligible and ultimately accountable to a materialistically grounded ethics of emancipation rooted in a conception of a ‘complex’ totality.",1
572,It is this perspective that Callinicos was concerned to deny the common conflation by postmodernists of Modernism with the Enlightenment.,1
573,"From his point of view, Modernism as a sub-species of romantic anti-capitalism is one partial moment in the rejection of the consequences of Enlightenment properly understood: understood, , a Marxism which is itself held out as the genuine heir to the Enlightenment narrative of emancipation its romantic critique.",1
574,"Here lies the root of Callinicos, project — the buttressing of Marxism as the ‘true radicalisation’ of the Enlightenment; and here I suspect lies also his ultimate discomfort with Modernism — prone as it is to slip the leash of a guiding politics and dance under the less biddable star of the Aesthetic.",1
575,"At this point Callinicos has to be careful: it is one thing to dismiss the claims of a rootless postmodernism, wandering naked its designer trainers across the face of a barren late capitalism.",1
576,It is quite another also to offer a wholesale refutation of Modernism.,1
577,"And Callinicos is aware of this: ‘Is not the general tendency of this analysis similar to Lukács' celebrated denunciation of Modernism as ‘aesthetically appealing, but decadent’?(p. 53).",1
578,"For fairly obvious reasons, mostly connected with the spectre of Zhdanov and Socialist Realism (but also I suspect a more subterranean philosophical linkage between Callinicos' endorsement of Althusser's ‘complex totality’ against Lukács' ‘expressive totality’and the political voluntarism which it informed in the early twenties), Callinicos has to answer: No.",1
579,"This begins to be interesting, and it is I think the originary focus of that sense of misgiving with which I began.",1
580,"If I have been primarily expository hitherto (and I have been because I believe Callinicos' book to be the best on this subject that we have) I will now begin to turn to criticism; or to trying to ventilate that reservation which, faced by Callinicos, certainty, will not be stilled.",1
581,In a sense it doesn't matter if Callinicos' defence of Marxism is registered or not by the legion of Post-isms and -ists which form the undergrowth of contemporary cultural politics.,1
582,"They will wither at the first frosts anyway, if they come; and if they don't…",1
583,"But with his placement of Modernism in the lineage of Nietzsche, and as such at odds with Marx  and Freud as the real motors of that ‘true radicalisation of the Enlightenment’(p. 120) which is the only way ahead, something more serious is at stake.",1
584,"To backtrack , the case is perhaps not so monolithic as I have implied: for which we have to return to the detail of Callinicos' ‘No’ to Lukács.",1
585,"On the one hand — and this is a point to which I shall return — there is a dual claim against Lukács' evolutionism (to the effect that different levels of a social formation are relatively autonomous: crudely, if bourgeois society is decadent this does not necessarily mean, as Lukács thought it did, that its art is too), and the possibility of being able to pass a positive ‘aesthetic judgement’ upon a particular work however questionable the general category under which it has been produced (a position related to Brecht's polemic against Lukács).",1
586,"More empirically however, on the other hand, and drawing upon the work of Peter Bürger, Callinicos accepts the case for Modernism having contained a critical moment — a ‘protest against the capitalist society to which it is in complex ways related’(p. 53).",1
587,"This is principally indexed to the claimed historical transformation of Modernism into a series of engaged avant-gardes dedicated not to the aestheticisation of life, but to the integration of art into life.",1
588,As Bürger has it: ‘Aestheticism had made the distance from the praxis of life the content of works.,1
589,The business of the new configuration was different: art ‘transferred to the praxis of life’— not however ‘to integrate art into this praxis’ but ‘the attempt to organise a new life praxis from a basis in art’(cited p. 54).,1
590,"The ‘avant-garde’ here means, , constructivism, surrealism and a range of Weimar practices grouped by Callinicos somewhat misleadingly under the label ‘Neue Sachlichkeit’.",1
591,"Just how remote this stance in fact is from the aesthetic is a matter for further debate, but it is perhaps worth interpolating that the implied valorisation of the products of these engaged avant-gardes as a function of their engagement is defeasible.",1
592,"Contra Buchloh .,",1
593,"Callinicos, there is nothing as far as art (as distinct from culture or politics) is concerned which will privilege a Tatlin made in revolutionary Petrograd from a Matisse painted in a hotel bedroom on the Riviera — Benjamin on technique notwithstanding (don't forget: Benjamin owned a Klee).",1
594,"Be that as it may, these avant-gardes are held to have a ‘distinctive character’ which resides in their ‘seeking to abolish the separation between art and life’.",1
595,For Callinicos this is ‘unquestionable’; as is the fact that the shift is enabled by the Bolshevik revolution of 1917.,1
596,(These arguments owe much to Perry Anderson's location of the tripartite enabling conditions of the Modern movement as: a decrepit academicism; the presence of new technologies; and ‘the imaginative proximity of social revolution’.),1
597,For Callinicos it is October which made the vision of social transformation ‘concrete’.,1
598,"The downside of this, so to speak, is that the defeat of October's aspirations also marks the avant-garde's defeat.",1
599,‘Between them Stalinism and Nazism destroyed the .,1
600,"The political defeats of the 1930s ‘shipwreck’ the avant-garde, and furthermore, through a kind of extension (since one assumes Anderson's tripartite conjuncture fuelled even those Modernist forms which did not quite take the transformatory step into engaged avant-gardism) come to determine ‘the more general exhaustion of Modernism’.",1
601,"The end of the Second World War is marked by the incipient commodification of social life, and as such ‘the disintegration of the Modernist conjuncture’(pp. 60 — 1).",1
602,The problem then begins to stand clear and I shall now have to be brief and schematic.,1
603,Callinicos drives a coach and horses through postmodernism; well and good.,1
604,"But the roads on which he drives it also go through most of the art produced in the last half century — shall we say for the sake of convenience, since the death of Trotsky; or in a more apt frame of reference, since ?",1
605,"I will simply have to state the case dogmatically, but: this is untenable.",1
606,All of Callinicos' philosophical sophistication and matchless political experience evaporate in the face of the art of his own lifetime.,1
607,"the fact that he doesn't actually discuss it in any detail, there is little more than a disappointed huffing and puffing at the exhaustion of the avant-garde's shock value (backed up by a particularly crass quotation from Peter Bürger about Duchamp's readymades) and some utterly routine panting over the outlandish prices being currently paid for Van Goghs — plus a quotation from a sub-Warholian Manhattan ‘artist’ answering an art magazine questionnaire with a few smart remarks about business and producing art for the market.",1
608,this were adequate to underwrite a claim for the avant-garde's loss of critical virtue.,1
609,"In an extraordinary passage towards the end of the book, amplified in discussion at Marxism 90 in a debate specifically convened to discuss Modernism and Postmodernism, Callinicos described his experience of walking around an art gallery: ‘I have often been struck by the tedium that overcomes one while walking through a gallery of twentieth-century painting arranged in chronological order as one moves from the excitement of the early part of the century to the desperate and all too frequently sterile iconoclasm of recent artists' (p. 161).",1
610,"The specifics aren't clear, but the contextual indications are that this would include American art from say, Pollock to André, not to mention a range of contemporary work on commodification stemming from Warhol.",1
611,"All of which says more about Callinicos, and the limits on his knowledge and interests, than it does about the work.",1
612,"Whither Brecht now, on the lure of the good old days; not to mention the nostalgia laid at the door of romantic anti-capitalism?",1
613,I shall conclude briefly.,1
614,The point is I think that the argument from here can go two ways.,1
615,The first response is that it doesn't matter very much.,1
616,"Callinicos, defence of Marxism is erudite and compelling, and the fact that he runs steam over post-war art is of less moment than the fact that he takes the range of issues seriously enough to discuss them .",1
617,"Most sociologists, economists and politicians, after all, don't get that far.",1
618,"The second road is however rockier; and it is an undecided question whether its implications are depressing and frightening, or challenging and exhilarating.",1
619,"Callinicos is very careful to say, in two places in the book, that aesthetic judgement the value of a work of art is relatively independent of the cultural and philosophical critique of the bases from which it proceeds.",1
620,"Thus, in his discussion of Modernism Lukács and Brecht: ‘to highlight the fact that Modernism shares with Romanticism a ‘subjectified occasionalism, is not thereby to pass a negative aesthetic judgement on the works of art grouped together under the former label.",1
621,Brecht's polemic (i.e. against Lukács)[…]retains all its force today’(p. 53).,1
622,And again Postmodernism: ‘Nor does the argument set out in this section imply the dismissal of all recent works — including those described as ‘Postmodern’—— as worthless rubbish.,1
623,Good art can be produced in an immense variety of different conditions’(p. 161).,1
624,This magnanimity is precisely the problem.,1
625,The traffic is all one way.,1
626,"Callinicos appears to think that he can detect ‘aesthetic merit’ from the position given to him by his politics; politics, writ large, as embodying an ethics and a philosophy, is the active force.",1
627,Thus post-Second World War art is as it is —— with an ‘emphasis on the autonomous and abstract work of art’(p. 154)— allegedly the ‘effects’ of the stabilisation and extension of capitalism.,1
628,Cause and effect: what took place was a ‘flight into abstraction’.,1
629,"This is a language, a world view, a form of life perhaps, wherein one of the principal reasons for according praise to a type of art is that it is able to give voice to a politics; Bolshevism in the main case, though as Callinicos acknowledges, one of the salient points about Modernism was its ‘ambiguity, its capacity to express a variety of different political positions’; , when it was not engaged on its more usual ‘flight from politics’(p. 161).",1
630,"Art, it seems, is the perpetual recidivist, always ducking back into the aesthetic vigilant life averts its gaze.",1
631,"When times are bad and reactionary commodification sets in, the deleterious upshot is ‘the recuperation of the avant-garde for art’(p. 157).",1
632,"When things are on the up and the lodestar of a transformatory politics shines bright, so too does ‘the avant-garde project of overcoming the separation of art and life’(p. 171).",1
633,In this perspective it seems that Callinicos can only mean relatively little with his disclaimers about good art.,1
634,"The individual ‘good’ work might get thrown up, however unpropitious the circumstance.",1
635,But it can only be a quirk; and the force of its ‘goodness’ is strictly limited and circumscribed.,1
636,"Only once, in a fleeting reference to Matisse is there a sense of the boot being on the other foot, of art offering a sense of liberation from social ideology.",1
637,But even this is done in the name of a supposed ‘immediate sensuous charge’ any more extended critical capacity of art or the aesthetic.,1
638,", the whole thrust of the historic avant-garde, and particularly its celebration here, lies in its being associated with a liberation from bourgeois ideology; but this is not quite the same as having your revolutionary commitments tested by your aesthetic judgement.",1
639,"For the greater part, the aesthetic is bracketed in the name of a robust historical materialism.",1
640,"And there is no room for doubt which is the tail, and which the dog.",1
641,Walter Benjamin once implied something rather different.,1
642,"Speaking against social realism in ‘The Author as Producer’, he identifies a work's ‘political tendency’ and its ‘literary tendency’.",1
643,The relationship he postulates is not one-way traffic; it is dialectical.,1
644,A work ‘can only be politically correct if it is also literarily correct’.,1
645,"I take this to mean that there is an equality, a reciprocity between the aesthetic and the political an aesthetic dimension or response can give the lie to a political claim.",1
646,"The point of Benjamin's article seems to be to decentre the political, or to subject it to test, to remove those making claims for their political correctness from their habitual position of judge and jury: the art can, in principle, sort out the politics, and not just .",1
647,"It is this, in the end, which I find disquieting about Callinicos' book.",1
648,Not the vapidity of the postmodern which it reveals.,1
649,But the way in which the very limits of its historical materialism (which I take to be the most developed statement of the case available in English) put back on the agenda questions one had considered closed.,1
650,"The critique of Nietzsche's apocalyptic aestheticism, with its injunction to build your dwelling on the slopes of Vesuvius, just cannot be reduced to the cliché about Baudrillard fiddling while Rome burns with which the book closes.",1
651,(Is it anyway such a bad thing to make music while Atlantis sinks and cities evaporate?,1
652,"you would have to be a doctor to say so, and not a politician or an academic.)",1
653,"A requirement to minimise, even to trivialise the aesthetic — one might almost say, a fear of the aesthetic — is the hollowness at the heart of historical materialism as it is defended here.",1
654,There is obviously a problem concerning the subjective dimension of the aesthetic.,1
655,But a tame aesthetic is no friend of historical materialism.,1
656,"Art has to be more than an ornament, or a reinforcement.",1
657,"There has to be the possibility that the politics can be put at risk by the aesthetics, or the relationship each of its components will be inert.",1
658,"An unpredictable aesthetic, it could be said, is a requirement of an historical materialism adequate to its political task.",1
659,"If the aesthetic is genuinely to  have reciprocal leverage upon the political, certain problems have to be faced.",1
660,", what goes on when looking at, say, a Matisse in an art gallery.",1
661,"It is easy to say that the time spent considering the Matisse is time better spent than that spent considering a Gerasimov, a Bouguereau.",1
662,(It is a terminal problem with the race n'class n'gender triptych that all these transactions are equivalently sociological.),1
663,But what of time spent otherwise?,1
664,How to adjudicate?,1
665,"The problem goes inescapably to a notion of the quality of experience (though what we are calling the aesthetic here is not, or not only, a question of intensity).",1
666,"The relationship between, say, reading an article in on the bureaucracy's pursuit of revenge on Arthur Scargill, and what it is that can be got from staring at Rembrandt's nose in a late self-portrait just is open.",1
667,One is not more important than the other.,1
668,"Which is also to say that it is not the case that there is no connection, or that a category mistake is involved in the mere comparison.",1
669,The information about Arthur should bear upon how one regards the Rembrandt.,1
670,But the way Rembrandt's nose is worked should equally provide a corrective to rhetoric or elision in the writing on bureaucracy.,1
671,"Which is to say, the political commentary is a form of writing.",1
672,"Or, to use an unfashionable term in these linguistic days, of thought.",1
673,And it is of the utmost importance to realise that the pragmatic answer to these questions is itself what makes the revolution never happen.,1
674,Which latter is not however to say that ‘correct thinking’ overturns society.,1
675,"Thought and organisation, or aesthetics and politics, must circle warily, the one never letting the other its sight.",1
676,"The abyss which all this opens up is, perhaps, terrifying before it is ‘depressing’.",1
677,I have mentioned Walter Benjamin here.,1
678,Callinicos concludes his book by invoking the memory of Benjamin to the effect that socialist revolution in the form of an irruption into history is the secular vehicle of a redemption hitherto conceivable only in mystic terms.,1
679,"For Callinicos it is a belief in this possibility, and that alone, which remainders melancholy and irony — , Modernism — as an adequate response to modern life.",1
680,"It is the consequence — presumably unintended — of his argument, however, that it demonstrates so irrevocably how much this is a matter of commitment and as such beyond the reach of proof.",1
681,"One could say that the pressing question is how it is possible to live, what teleology to adopt; or that the latter does not sort the former out.",1
682,"Benjamin remarked, tellingly, that it is less a question of what a man's beliefs are than the kind of man those beliefs make of him.",1
683,This is no less an aesthetic matter than a political one.,1
684,"Callinicos, in his haste to counter aestheticism, reduces the aesthetic.",1
685,He has to.,1
686,Yet the aesthetic will not be reduced.,1
687,"It is not the means to an end conceived elsewhere: but an ‘’, no less substantial than the of revolution itself.",1
688,"Value, you say?",1
689,"Pushkin eating cherries before a duel; Lenin working day in day out on Iskra; one sentence or a newspaper (the point is , not one without the other); Benjamin on the requirement to denature your work ‘like ethyl alcohol’ lest it be of use to the other side.",1
690,"For revolutions may occur, but the belief that they will does not of itself ensure a better lived life.",1
691,"truth and beauty — the truth can doubtless beautiful, though it need not be.",1
692,"Certain kinds of one-way traffic, certain kinds of one-way street, are in the end not hard to negotiate.",1
693,Their avoidance may be more difficult .,1
694,And there is always the possibility — the necessity?— that beauty can be its own truth.,1

696,THE ART OF SCIENCE,1
697,GEOFFREY CANTOR,1
698,"The Science of Art: Optical Themes in Western Art from Brunelleschi to Seurat, Martin Kemp, Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1990. pp. viii — 375; 554 black and white illustrations — 16 colour plates.",1
699,ISBN 0 — 300 — 04337 — 6. £49.,1
700,"In a heady essay written over thirty years ago, Giorgio de Santillana argued that some of the key ideas of the Scientific Renaissance were to be traced to developments in the arts.",1
701,", the idea of space was transformed from the Aristotelian conception — a ‘tidy arrangement of a simple multiplicity of things, not unlike, let us say, the shipping department of SearsRoebuck-— into ‘a matrix for infinite potential complexities and states and tensions’.",1
702,"The main innovators of this transformation were not scientists but artists, especially Alberti, Brunelleschi and Leonardo, who created on their canvases and in their architecture and treatises a new conception of space.",1
703,When I first encountered de Santillana's paper in the late 1960s I found it both fascinating and suggestive.,1
704,"Its attraction arose principally from its iconoclastic message, for de Santillana explained one of the key conceptual innovations in the rise of modern science in terms that challenged the assumptions of my teachers in the history of science.",1
705,"They had argued that the new ideas about space and motion had arisen from an intellectual and, to a much lesser extent, empirical critique of the preceding, largely Anstotelian, notions.",1
706,"Discussion of this transformation was confined to the great tradition of philosopher-scientists beginning with Aristotle, continuing with medieval authors, Oresme and Jordanus, and ending with Kepler, Galileo, Descartes and, , Newton.",1
707,De Santillana offered a very different account of the new ideas of space and a different cast of actors.,1
708,"Most importantly, he claimed that the new science was not the progeny of earlier science but the outgrowth of developments in the practical arts.",1
709,In his account the history of art and the history of science were intrinsically linked: in the late 1960s this was an heretical claim to most historians of science (and probably many historians of art).,1
710,Although sympathetic to this heresy I found myself intoxicated but also somewhat inhibited by de Santillana's impressionistic style.,1
711,"However exciting his paper, his thesis seemed in danger of crumbling if it were reworked into a conventional historical discourse.",1
712,"In the book under review, Martin Kemp reexamines the art-science relationship with much care and circumspection.",1
713,His style is lucid and he emerges as an honest broker who judiciously weighs the historical evidence.,1
714,He has an impressive command of the literature of both art and optical science across much of Europe and over a span of four centuries.,1
715,"In contrast to de Santillana's uninterrupted thirty pages of text, Kemp's thesis is amply illustrated with several hundred plates, including many of his own line drawings showing artists' deployment of visual angles, vanishing points, etc.",1
716,The reader is led gently through the history of art and the details of optical science to appreciate their interrelationship.,1
717,"Albeit less impressionistic and insightful, Kemp's analysis is of broader scope and greater clarity than de Santillana's.",1
718,Kemp identifies optics as a topic of common concern to both art and science.,1
719,(In a sequel he proposes to pursue the role of anatomy and natural history in the history of art.),1
720,Of the many interweaving strands within this extensive topic he concentrates primarily on the way artists have deployed scientific ideas and instruments — these connections constitute ‘the science of art’ of his title —— while he also encompasses a number of related themes.,1
721,"The science of art, claims Kemp, has not been adequately appreciated by art historians and to begin to rectify the situation he strives to demonstrate that ‘there were special kinds of affinity between the central intellectual and observational concerns in the visual arts and the sciences, in European history between the Renaissance and the nineteenth century (p. 1).",1
722,In the first of the book's three sections Kemp examines the theory and practice of perspective from Brunelleschi to Turner.,1
723,"The second section, which is less focused and less easy to characterise, contains discussion of perspective machines and other technical aids theories of perception.",1
724,The final section is concerned with the theory and depiction of colour.,1
725,In the first section one of Kemp's main themes is the relationship between theoria and praxis.,1
726,"Renaissance artists confronting the problem of portraying spatial arrangement, responded by developing linear perspective.",1
727,The initial emphasis was on praxis.,1
728,"Following the first crude attempts by Giotto, Lorenzetti and others, Brunelleschi got it right.",1
729,"Then, in the mid-1430s, Alberti the theorist codified the system.",1
730,The basic rules of linear perspective were now accessible to any artist.,1
731,Theoria could influence praxis.,1
732,The relation between the theory and practice of  perspective over the next four centuries is examined in detail.,1
733,Textbooks flourished making the rules of perspective available to aspiring artists.,1
734,"Codifiers produced ever more elaborate schemes for the depiction of spatial arrangements, often thereby rendering their work incomprehensible to the practising artist.",1
735,"Artists, architects and draughtsmen experimented with the new schemes since the theory of perspective offered exciting possibilities to depict the spatial relations between bodies.",1
736,"Thus the eye could be subjected to precise ‘reality’, or it could be repositioned, led, titillated or deceived.",1
737,Some of the most fascinating material in this book is provided by the uses of perspective to create illusions — Mantegna's Camera degli Sposi (1465 — 74) and Pozzo's dome of San Ignazio (1685).,1
738,"Moreover, Kemp hints at the diverse uses of perspective which offer a rich commentary on European history.",1
739,In the third and final section of the book Kemp addresses the use and theory of colours.,1
740,He argues that in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries many artists adopted versions of the Aristotelian theory which asserted that colours are a mixture of black and white in different proportions.,1
741,They also often used constructively the analogy between colours and the harmonic scale.,1
742,"However, Newton's theory of light and colours, first published in 1672 and extended in his (1704), provided a new direction for colour theorists.",1
743,"In opposition to Aristotle , Newton showed with his prism that white light is a mixture of its composite colours.",1
744,"Moreover, in the he identified seven colours in the spectrum and described a circle divided into seven segments that could be used to account for colour mixing.",1
745,Newton's views were subsequently both elaborated and criticised.,1
746,Colour circles became ever more elaborate and orientated towards the practice of colour-mixing — witness those of Moses Harris (c. 1770) and Michel-Lugène Chevreul (1839).,1
747,Louis Castel exploited the analogy between light and sound with his ‘Ocular clavichord’ and Goethe explored subjective colours.,1
748,For their part artists were experimenting and drawing on the insights provided by the colour theorists.,1
749,Delacroix took Chevreul seriously.,1
750,"Turner, always alive to new ideas, responded creatively to both Harris and Goethe.",1
751,"Seurat paid close attention to both Helmholtz's (1867) and Ogden Rood's (1879) which, in turn, was based on James Clerk Maxwell's three-colour theory of vision.",1
752,Such a brief summary does not do justice to the detail and complexity of Kemp's argument.,1
753,"Optics provides a superb locus for examining the art-science relationship since optical problems, theories and constructions were integral to both science and art.",1
754,To admit that much is not to foreclose the question of defining that relationship since a nuanced understanding requires the command of historical detail that Kemp provides.,1
755,"Viewed from the late twentieth century and the widespread acceptance of the ‘two cultures’, the search for affinities between art and science possesses particular significance for the historian.",1
756,"Yet, by viewing history in this manner Kemp encounters an historiographical difficulty that he never satisfactorily resolves.",1
757,This problem surfaces even in his introduction in which he states that his concern is to show how artists ‘consciously aspired towards goals that as scientific in a broad sense’(p. 1).,1
758,Part of this passage has been italicised to draw attention to the somewhat presentist presupposition that underpins much of this book.,1
759,In qualifying ‘scientific’ by ‘in a broad sense’Kemp shows that he is aware of this problem.,1
760,"However, the presentist influence is all too pervasive.",1
761,His frequent appeals to ‘scientific concepts’ and ‘scientific ideas’often presuppose an unambiguous definition of science and one that is atemporal.,1
762,The difficulty is most apparent when discussing the Renaissance since by hypostatising science and art as two separate and separable activities Kemp is framing a problem that did not exist for the historical actors.,1
763,"Take the example of Brunelleschi who, Kemp, introduced ‘scientific consistency’ into his use of perspective (p. 14).",1
764,The phrase suggests that Brunelleschi was engaging in an activity art.,1
765,Was he doing science?,1
766,"And if so, would he and his contemporaries have recognised that in pursuing this consistency he was doing science, not art?",1
767,"Again, how were science and art demarcated in the early fifteenth century —— socially, intellectually and institutionally?",1
768,Kemp's difficulty in defining ‘science’ and ‘art’is not confined to his discussion of the earlier period.,1
769,", in his appraisal of the eighteenth century he uses ‘scientific’ and ‘Newtonian’as predicates to create the impression of an hypostasised activity which stood separate from art and other aspects of Western culture, including philosophy.",1
770,"Thus we are told that Brook Taylor, the author of the first major British work on perspective (1715), was ‘a professional Newtonian scientist’(p. 287).",1
771,"Although Taylor was active in the Royal Society, both predicates misrepresent this English gentleman who wrote extensively on mathematics and religion.",1
772,"Likewise, his over-rigid use of categories, Kemp characterises David Brewster, the most eulogistic of Newton's nineteenth-century biographers, as an ‘anti-Newtonian’(p. 300).",1
773,A related and equally significant problem arises from Kemp's search for causal historical relations between science and art.,1
774,Questions of historical influence feature prominently in this study.,1
775,Kemp frequently provides details of superficial social acquaintance between scientists and artists and refers to their reading habits.,1
776,"This is, in one sense, unobjectionable and Kemp rightly weighs the evidence for influence circumspectly.",1
777,"However, the very preoccupation with identifying causal influences begs more fundamental questions about whether contemporaries shared intellectual assumptions.",1
778,", the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century was constituted not only by the new theories of Descartes, Galileo and Newton but also by new ways of experiencing the world, interacting with it and thinking about it.",1
779,"this claim, the mores of the eighteenth century were radically different from the sixteenth.",1
780,Yet this difference is somewhat obscured in Kemp's analysis by his concern to explicate the details of numerous perspective schemes and the techniques employed by artists.,1
781,He thereby pays less attention than he might to interpreting the science of art as a cultural phenomenon.,1
782,"Ideological and philosophical issues receive inadequate attention and yet these could have helped define the common context (or, perhaps, the contrasting contexts) in which art and science were pursued.",1
783,"Again, Kemp's subject raises important questions about the structure and function of institutions which he only engages parenthetically.",1
784,"More generally, a less causal and more structural approach might have been fruitful in illuminating the historical conditioning of the science of art.",1
785,Another example of a terminological difficulty arises in the section in which Kemp briefly examines the relation between perspective and eighteenth-century theories of perception.,1
786,"Unfortunately he predicates his discussion on the contrast between ‘empiricists’ and ‘nativists’, a distinction he soon recognises as inadequate.",1
787,"Kemp's historiography, it is not surprising that he concludes that ideas about perception (which were often explicitly discussed by ‘scientists’ and ‘philosophers') had little impact on artists (p. 237).",1
788,"While he has usefully identified theories of perception as an aspect of the science of art, they deserve a more eclectic and sustained analysis.",1
789,Let me therefore mention briefly some further dimensions of the subject.,1
790,"Many artists, scientists and philosophers engaged the question of whether linear (or any other) perspective provides the true account of how we perceive.",1
791,For some authors perspective provides both the laws of perception and also the key to the true and rational representation of objects.,1
792,Learn perspective and you can imitate nature precisely.,1
793,"However, many artists seriously questioned this wisdom.",1
794,In their art they combined perspective with drawing ‘by eye’; they instinctively knew when to follow the rules and when to break them.,1
795,"This, for Kemp, is an important clue to the success of Velázquez and Turner for whom perspective was a useful servant but a poor master.",1
796,But artists were not alone in considering and debating the truth and limitations of perspective.,1
797,"A related point on which most (but not all) physical scientists (or, more appropriately, natural philosophers) of the seventeenth century would have agreed, was the primacy of mathematics in analysing the physical universe.",1
798,"Their reasons for adopting this view differed somewhat, but we can take Galileo's position as not atypical.",1
799,"Echoing Plato, Galileo claimed that God had created the world mathematical proportions.",1
800,This implied that only in the sphere of the mathematical sciences can the human intellect attain knowledge that is as objective and as certain as it is known to the divine mind.,1
801,Through mathematics truth and reality could be laid bare and appearances transcended.,1
802,This metaphysical commitment came under scrutiny not only from those artists who refused to be limited by the laws of perspective but also from ‘scientists’ and ‘philosophers’.,1
803,One of the most forceful attacks was by George Berkeley in his (1709).,1
804,Here Berkeley argued strenuously against the view that we judge the distance of objects lines and angles.,1
805,"Although most commentators have claimed that Berkeley's principal opponent was Descartes, whom he cited as an example only in the second (1710) edition, he was more generally denying the widely-received assumption that we see the laws of geometry — this assumption being central to the perspectivist tradition.",1
806,"(Berkeley was familiar with perspective machines, one of which he described in a later work.)",1
807,"Instead, Berkeley sought to show that we learn to judge the distance, magnitude and situation of objects.",1
808,This controversial book was widely discussed but whether it was read by artists I leave to further research.,1
809,"Berkeley was not alone in questioning whether geometrical methods are adequate to account for visual perception since there was a large literature on the subject by ‘scientists’ and, as Kemp shows, artists also frequently commented on it.",1
810,One of the leading problems in this area was the horizontal moon illusion: the moon appears larger near the horizon than in its zenith.,1
811,"Since Ptolemy tried to solve this problem in the second century, it has been on the agenda of theorists of perception and is still, I understand, not fully resolved.",1
812,In the eighteenth century it was one of the main test cases for the dominance of geometry.,1
813,"Attacks on geometrically-based theories of vision (together with the deployment of such examples as the horizontal moon illusion) provide a theme of common concern to artists, scientists and philosophers and deserve further analysis than Kemp offers.",1
814,"If there are aspects of the science of art that Kemp fails to engage adequately, the scope of this book is nevertheless very impressive and a number of the issues he discusses impinge on my concerns as an historian of science.",1
815,Let me allude to two of these issues.,1
816,In the history of science theoria has usually been accorded far greater importance than praxis.,1
817,The general view has been that theoria is the engine driving the historical development of science and that praxis is merely the application of theoria.,1
818,"Although some historians, often Marxists, have rejected this consensus, only recently have aspects of praxis, laboratory skills, been subjected to close and sustained study.",1
819,In this respect the  historian of science has much to learn from an art historian like Kemp.,1
820,"Moreover, the analysis of skills provides a common topic of research for both art and science historians.",1
821,The second issue concerns the art-science relationship which Kemp analyses through the history of perspective and of colour.,1
822,The latter case is the more straightforward since he presents the impact of Newton's theory of coloured light as radically reorientating this area.,1
823,"With perspective, the key figures of the Scientific Revolution are presented as the heirs to developments in art.",1
824,", we encounter Galileo as a bit-player who corresponded with Lodovico Cigoli over his lunar and sunspot observations.",1
825,"More particularly, Galileo used standard perspective procedures in accounting for the foreshortening of the spots which he claimed in 1613 were on the surface of the sun.",1
826,Unfortunately Kepler receives even less attention.,1
827,"Yet in 1600 Kepler made important contributions to optical science, especially to the theory of image formation.",1
828,Kepler's concern with the formation of images was a response to a practical problem.,1
829,He noticed that when viewed with a the image of the sun was too large but this enlargement was not explained by existing theory.,1
830,"Instead, he conceived every illuminated point being the source of rays spreading in all directions; a bundle of these rays (a single ray) pass through the hole in a (or the pupil of the eye).",1
831,Thus the image is enlarged the finite size of the hole.,1
832,In his resolution of the problem Kepler represented his rays by strings.,1
833,", in ascertaining the image of a book on a distant plane, he adopted a procedure familiar to artists for almost a century.",1
834,He used a stretched string to plot ray paths that just grazed the book in their transit from the source of the screen.,1
835,This method of repeatedly deploying a stretched string to plot the light rays and thus ascertain selected points on an image was incorporated into the perspective machines described by Leonardo and Dürer.,1
836,"While the example of Kepler illustrates the influence of artistic practice on a ‘scientist’(which is not Kemp's primary concern), discussion of this instance would have enhanced considerably the author's argument that both the theory and practice of perspective were significant resources for the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century.",1
837,"He also argues that, in its turn, the Scientific Revolution had some effect on the visual arts.",1
838,"Military engineers, who were also often mathematicians, Simon Stevin and Girard Desargues, contributed significantly to the subject of perspective.",1
839,"Newton is portrayed as influencing eighteenth-century perspective in an unspecified manner, although his effect on colour theory is seen as considerable.",1
840,"However, on Kemp's account few artists took notice of the philosophical, mathematical and scientific innovations of Descartes and Kepler.",1
841,"By the eighteenth century there was a considerable parting of the ways since the more erudite mathematical treatises on perspective, those by Lambert and Monge, were of no use to the practising artist.",1
842,"Even optical instruments, perspective machines, the and the camera lucida, were used sparingly.",1
843,"It appears that once science gained its independent identity, scientists and artists used perspective for increasingly different purposes.",1
844,As with de Santillana's innovatory essay Kemp's book not only offers new ways of understanding the history of science and the history of art but it also raises a host of historical and historiographical questions.,1
845,These questions in turn suggest further lines of research that deserve serious attention by historians of both science and art.,1
846,Kemp has performed a valuable service in opening up this area.,1
847,I hope other historians will now follow his lead.,1

864,"includes only two synoptical essays, the rest being made up of a selection of documents produced in various parts of Europe and Britain from the fifties to the eighties, some of which predate the founding of the Situationist International (henceforth the ‘SI').",1
865,"These are followed by documents relating to the SI in Britain which include Ralph Rumney's (1957), and brief statements by Michèle Bernstein which appear in the British press in the 1950s and 1960s.",1
866,The greater part of the Scrapbook largely consists of what the editor identifies as ‘the British inheritance’ which covers the period from 1966 — 1988.,1
867,The book is therefore very much an account of the movement's influence in Britain.,1
868,"The Boston text relates more exclusively to the movement itself and includes, historical material, a brief statement by Mark Francis which is intended to justify and explain the motives behind the exhibition (the Situationists did not give the event their blessings and none of the past members participated in its planning).",1
869,"‘What we have sought to do’, claims Francis speaking for the organisers of the exhibition, ‘is not to reconstruct time past but to expose to the light things that have run the risk of acquiring the patina of nostalgia and the glamour of neglect.’",1
870,If this statement betrays a certain uneasiness it is perhaps not surprising given the subversive status of the Situationist project and their condemnation of the art world.,1
871,"Francis also implies, somewhat unconvincingly, that the event was conceived in a spirit of Potlatch and accepts the Lettrist belief in the legitimate use of plagiarism.",1
872,"The Lettrists and the Situationists had used ‘pre-existing elements’ for their own ends, and so the editors of the Boston text and the curators of have, they feel, a certain entitlement to do the same.",1
873,"This legitimation in turn is related to the principle of , a term which had been coined initially by the Lettrists for their neo-Dadaist practice of cannibalising pre-existent materials (in the manner of Duchamp's ) with subversive intent.",1
874,My view of the exhibition and these complementary texts is that they seem to lack the critical motivation and the dialectical irony of the Situationists.,1
875,"They are normative representations, reverential in tone, recuperative in effect and the ideological positions which they reflect are conveniently distanced from those of the SI.",1
876,Self-evidently these texts are strikingly different from original materials issued by the SI in the sense that they have the status of copyrighted property and have been funded by organisations which in the past may have supported progressive art but which do not sound like the champions of revolutionary causes.,1
877,"The Boston text, , is published with the assistance of the Getty Grant Program, Massachusetts Council of the Arts and the Humanities, and additional funding is provided by the Lila Wallace Reader's Digest Fund (the benefactor of the American Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York).",1
878,"The Scrapbook is also variously supported by Association Française d'Action Artistique, the Ministry of Culture, Copenhagen, the Instituo Banco San Paulo of Turin, Becks Bier, to name some of the backers, and also by the furtively named Friends of the Situationist International, whoever they are!",1
879,"More prosaically, the sandpaper cover (which, like the Jorn/Debord text of  1959, is meant to damage your other books) was donated by English Abrasives and Chemicals Ltd.",1
880,One of the first ‘political’ statements in the Boston text is the copyright restriction notice.,1
881,It appears a few lines the plagiarised title of the book.,1
882,"The proscription is, , a legal convention which we would normally take for granted, but is, in this context, inconsistent with the SI anti-copyright policy and, the Lautréamont axiom: ‘Plagiarism is necessary — progress implies it,’ which Francis cites on page 19, is an unintended irony.",1
883,"The Boston text is more obviously an exhibition catalogue, if only because it includes a ‘checklist’ of the exhibition, which, ignoring the problematic identity of some of the works, distinguishes between works of art and other items (books, tracts, pamphlets, etc.) and also carefully identifies the status of individual exhibits by signifying their producer's relationship to the formally identified Situationist group.",1
884,"There is another category for Situationist wannabees, which was an additional and problematical area of both books and the exhibition.",1
885,"Some of the materials in this area seemed to have the purpose of padding out the exhibition, whilst at the same time fulfilling the traditional function of consolidating the achievements of the founding group whose significance it was the purpose of the exhibition to celebrate.",1
886,Francis identifies the stages of the SI narrative as a chronological trajectory corresponding to (i) the Experimental Laboratory period;(ii) the detonator period (which refers to Debord's boast that he provided the explosive machinery that ignited in May 1968);(iii) the Fallout period after the SI disbanded in 1972.,1
887,These stages provide the logic for the ‘diachronic structure’ of the exhibition.,1
888,"In the Fallout section are included artists, writers and others ‘who all had (sic) some contact with the SI’.",1
889,Periodisation and classification present some difficulties which Wollen hints at when he comments on ‘the ‘simulationist’ art boom of the eighties and its debt to the dry husks of Situationist thought’.,1
890,It is to be regretted that neither of these books examine the pluralism of the ‘simulationist’ period.,1
891,"To the extent that the Situationists raised questions about cultural hierarchies and the ‘supersession’ of art, how should we judge the Fallout period?",1
892,"The notion of progression is clearly important in assessing this work, especially as the temptation to isolate, or even dismiss, it as an epiphenomenon of the SI is strong.",1
893,The materials displayed in the exhibition and reproduced in the Fallout section of the Scrapbook express ideas about which strong convictions are held.,1
894,"What are these convictions, and why are they not articulated?",1
895,Why were the exhibits left to speak for themselves?,1
896,"It seems extraordinary that, given the political fervour of the Paris-based SI fraction in its post-Lettrist phase, the exhibition should have been so solemnly organised with little regard to Debord's caveat on auteurism and his contempt for the art market.",1
897,"Whatever objectives the organisers might have had, the exhibition turned out to be a quite normative curatorial project.",1
898,The contradiction is perhaps a familiar one.,1
899,As Debord has commented: ‘This society signs a peace treaty with its most outspoken enemies by giving them a spot in the spectacle.',1
900,"It is noteworthy that the Situationists have produced nothing in the way of new projects for these texts, nor for the exhibition.",1
901,Predictably they kept their distance.,1
902,At the centre of the re-grouped SI in 1961 Bernstein and Debord refused any separation between artistic and political activity.,1
903,"It was at this time that Asgerjorn resigned his membership of the SI, although he continued to finance it through the sale of his paintings which were increasingly in demand in the 1960s.",1
904,"Thus re-grouped, the SI increased their political activity, eliminating all artistic production except agitational forms which meant, essentially, the use of illustrations in their publications.",1
905,The article by Wollen is an important piece of research and a major contribution to both anthologies.,1
906,"Despite its usefulness as an introduction to the subject, it does, however, judiciously avoid overt criticism of its subject and devotes little analysis to the SI in its mature phase.",1
907,"Nevertheless, Wollen presents a lucid account of the movement in its formative period and makes an interesting case for André Breton as a figure of some distinction in French intellectual history.",1
908,"He also traces the Hegelian, and Lukácsian influences on leftist theories in France in the heightened intellectual atmosphere after the Liberation which provided the aesthetic and political context for the Situationists.",1
909,"Wollen's historical and theoretical essay, the other major contribution in the Boston text is Thomas Y. Levin's ‘Dismantling the Spectacle: The Cinema of Guy Debord’.",1
910,This is again a comprehensive and thoroughly investigated article and is probably the first extended account of Situationist cinema in English.,1
911,Levin makes a special case for Debord as a film-maker whose aim was to contribute to the ultimate destruction of cinema as a spectacularist medium.,1
912,Debord's cinema for Levin is a paradigmatic vehicle for the movement's ‘destructive creativity’.,1
913,"The main purpose of Levin's article, however, is to reclaim Debord for the aesthetic discourse of avant-garde cinema.",1
914,", he identifies Debord as the source of Godard's innovations: ‘Indeed, well over a decade before Godard's , Debord was producing a revolutionary, materialist ‘counter-cinema’.’",1
915,"Not having seen Debord's films (he refused screenings at the ICA in London), Levin's arguments are in one sense untestable; nevertheless the article is not without difficulties.",1
916,"Defensively, he observes what he considers to be Debord's virtues and comments on the latter's avoidance of, as he puts it: ‘the various pitfalls — formalist essentialism, aestheticist myopia, politically naive fetishism of reflexivity, , typical of certain avant-garde practices linked to radical political agendas.’",1
917,"Nevertheless, Debord's place within a reified history of ‘political modernism’ is assured, more by virtue of what is claimed for the work than by its testing — Levin admits that screenings have been rare, especially outside France.",1
918,Both the personality and the work remain famously obscure in a way which seems almost contrived.,1
919,"Further to this, Levin claims that Debord ‘does not disparage pleasure’ and yet argues elsewhere in the essay that his films deliberately refuse to make concessions to the viewer.",1
920,"An example of this is the early Lettrist film , with its long periods of blank screen and extended silences.",1
921,"As far as one can assess the merit of Levin's text its subject, it seems somewhat implausible that Debord can be all the things for which he is proclaimed.",1
922,"Whatever defence is mounted, it is clear that these films, for Levin, exist as auratic objects, and Debord their auraticised progenitor.",1
923,"Hence the mythologisation of Debord by Levin, and others, has a significant bearing upon the reception of his work.",1
924,His remoteness and the scandal and intrigue associated with the SI have significantly contributed to the enhancement of the movement's reputation.,1
925,"Levin's essay, interesting though it is, achieves little more than assimilating Debord into the spectacularised history of the avant-garde cinema.",1
926,His hero-worship results in him reiterating the same claims that the cinéaste makes for himself.,1
927,"In the opening sequence of , as Levin notes, Debord provides the audience with a reference to a cinematic tradition in which his own work is putatively situated.",1
928,"The tradition includes ‘great landmarks’ in film history from early ‘genre classics,(Levin's term), Expressionist, Dada, Soviet cinema of the 1920s, Surrealist, Chaplin, Lettrist and last, but not least, Debord.",1
929,"Situationist cinema is therefore important, indeed, self-important, not least because it provides ‘an alternative sort of cinematic activity, incompatible with the economy of the spectacle’.",1
930,Levin earnestly considers Situationist film to be an effective oppositional practice.,1
931,"One of the attractions for Levin is the persistency with which Debord, like the Dadaists before him, continued to explore the medium, whilst contributing to its eventual destruction.",1
932,"Moreover, Levin claims that the Situationists never lost sight of their own contradictions, ‘by consenting to act culture’ as a precondition of their co-existence in the present order.",1
933,"Nevertheless, cinema ultimately retains a relative autonomy in Levin's tribute.",1
934,It is like Hegel's notion of the beautiful soul which denounces the world from which it has withdrawn to avoid having to recognise the extent of its participation in its disorder.,1
935,"Debord, as a film-maker, and Levin, as his apologist, take refuge in the transcendental space of autonomy where meanings have the illusion of self-regulation and independence of the totality they represent.",1
936,"Debord takes up his place (certainly in Levin's account) within the lineage of modern masters with its attendant construction of patriarchy, distinction and causal succession.",1
937,"In Levin's essay, avant-garde cinema is assimilated into the wider discourse of Modernist art despite their material and institutional differences.",1
938,One of the pitfalls of this is that different audiences and different modes of consumption are contingencies largely ignored.,1
939,Debord's apparent contempt for audiences has its counterpart in Levin's emphasis upon origination and prestige as paradigms of his cultural history.,1
940,The blurring of art and film histories leads Levin into the murky waters of Situationist discourse on art.,1
941,"Suffice it to say that this discourse is generalising and intemperate, and lacks depth and clarity.",1
942,"Debord, , proclaims: ‘The critical position later elaborated by the Situationists has shown that the suppression and realization of art are inseparable aspects of a single supersession of art.'",1
943,"There is some sense in this comment which may well explain the position of the Situationists at a particular conjunction, but it is a sense which would also explain earlier avant-garde trends in art (if not cinema) since, say, Futurism.",1
944,"Moreover, the notion of art's ‘single supersession’, an histrionic claim, would benefit from some kind of historical and theoretical contextualisation.",1
945,It sounds important but in fact is an impenetrable statement.,1
946,Further clarification might also be required how the Situationist negation of art (and cinema) related to the wider sphere of cultural-political struggle.,1
947,"The critique of art as an institution is continuous with earlier formations (including early Surrealism and Russian Constructivism), but Levin remains unclear in his definition of Debord's avant-gardism.",1
948,"For Lukács and Adorno the concept of the avant-garde was a touchstone: for the one it was negative and decadent, for the other positive and progressive.",1
949,"In Levin's account of Debord, his subject appears to hold both positions .",1
950,"More specifically, on the issue of cultural hierarchies and class relations the Situationists tried to distance themselves from bourgeois notions of progress and their equivalence in the neo-avant-garde of the post-war period.",1
951,"The SI thus rejected ‘mechanical becoming, with its notions of progress, merit and causal succession’.",1
952,"This statement reflects the resistance of the SI to piecemeal historicism which lineages are made, but in Levin's history the independent achievements of Debord as a film-maker eventually collapses into it.",1
953,"In fairness it has to be said that Levin tries to isolate Debord from a purely formal Modernism, and from naive realism (the politics of the signified).",1
954,"He does this by proclaiming, a ‘third avant-garde’, which avoids the major pitfalls (of the ‘two avant-gardes') and secures some theoretical authority for Debord.",1
955,"However, because this is not adequately related to the political ideals of the SI there is no analysis of the projected  means (theoretical or practical) by which the sublation of art in the praxis of life might be achieved.",1
956,"The reverential tone of Levin's text poses a problem which the movement's survivors, I imagine, would be quick to condemn.",1
957,"It is, , uncritical in the sense of failing to site Debord's films within an adequate theoretical discourse.",1
958,"Levin objectifies his subject through the use of an argument which leaves the SI unexplained as a revolutionary organisation with the potentiality of reflecting, by its own methods, a radical social transformation.",1
959,"What he provides is the missing chapter in the secret history of the cinema, the missing link between Berlin Dada and postmodernism.",1
960,"As with other contributors, exaggerated claims are made for (the communication which contains its own critique), firstly because it was an inheritance from Cubism and Dada, and secondly, because, as the exhibition shows, its deployment by ‘pro-situs’ has made of it a commonplace, popularised in punk fanzines, and ‘Biff’postcards etc.",1
961,"The Situationists' activities within the cultural sphere constituted an attempt to create a unified range of activities which functioned as a radical critique of the conventional boundaries between specialisations embedded in the institutions, practices and agencies of modern life.",1
962,"The fragmented appearance of their work, especially its Lettrist phase, their repudiation of conventional skills and scholarly manners (evidenced in their use of personal insults) have been absorbed by subcultural milieux and in due course adapted by the culture industries.",1
963,The influence of the Situationists is clearly demonstrated (if overstated) in these books.,1
964,"If the historical trajectory of the Scrapbook is followed (SI through Fluxus, Heatwave, King Mob, Jamie Reid, Vivienne Westwood, and the Sex Pistols) the Situationist role for the intellectual as an informed but passionate critic gives way to philistine incitements to violence (typified by King Mob in Britain, the Motherfuckers in the USA, and also indirectly the punk phenomenon) but more commonly a laidback and philosophically weak critique of everyday life.",1
965,"The political and philosophical origins of Situationist thought to a large degree derives from Marx's critique of alienation and commodity fetishism, Lukács's development of this critique, and the Marxist-existentialism of Sartre and Henri Lefebvre.",1
966,The rejection of liberal democracy and bureaucratic Marxism led the Situationists dominant political organisations and towards libertarian and syndicalist influences.,1
967,The ideas of Anton Pannekoek which emerged with the publication of his after World War One provided a ready-made model of a non-hierarchical political system.,1
968,"The simple faith conveyed in Pannekoek's treatise recalls earlier utopian writing, and contrasts with the strident and acerbic tone of Situationist writing.",1
969,"With the exception of Wollen, the contributors to the Scrapbook and the Boston text convey little concern for the forms of political organisation espoused by the Situationists, and it is perhaps symptomatic of their interest in the SI as a purely aesthetic phenomenon.",1
970,"The SI clearly endeavoured to produce a revolutionary critique of modern life, and towards this end devised a convulsive rhetoric and an inventive vocabulary.",1
971,"The revival of interest in its ideas might be explained by this, by its standing as a political organisation.",1
972,The remoteness of the movement from working-class experience guaranteed the survival of its bohemian image.,1
973,Its re-emergence as spectacle relates more visibly to its cult status and the nostalgic allure of fifties Paris; a marginalised and dissolute existence in the company of exotic friends and of romantic places with beautiful names.,1
974,The Boston text reproduces old photographs of founding members.,1
975,"The gamine looks of Bernstein and the neatness of Debord have an aesthetic relevance which signifies a rather vague, but nevertheless compelling, reason for their inclusion in the text.",1
976,They are not merely documentation.,1
977,They are in fact significant elements in the story of ‘Situationism’ which is the subtext of the book.,1
978,The political reticence evident in these volumes is indicated by a degree of randomness in the choice of materials and by implication a commitment to the more ‘expressive’ or irrationalist side of their work.,1
979,"It is, , revealing that there is no indication in either book of the Situationist commitment to political struggles in the Third World and their critique of imperialism.",1
980,The introductions in both books are anodyne and brief.,1
981,"The historical significance of the SI is not questioned, and the importance of the movement is asserted largely on the basis of aesthetic innovations which derive from the Lettrist period the founding of the SI.",1
982,"and (drifting) are thus reclaimed their contemporary relevance, or rather for the extent to which they influenced punk and the camp and erudite artistic radicalism which exploited it.",1
983,"With the exception of Levin's extended analysis of film, neither the products nor any specific agitations of the Situationists and their epigones are critical reassessment.",1
984,The short commentaries and comic imagery in the British section of the Scrapbook are largely printed ephemera with unserious political pretensions.,1
985,"Some of it is amusing, some of it pretentious drivel.",1
986,"Clearly much of the material is unsupportable and there is a sense in which this is self-evident the Scrapbook is styled as an ‘anti-document’ which, like the films of Debord, is co-extensive with the equally unsupportable and qualitatively diminished world to which it relates.",1
987,"The temptation is to view these publications and the exhibition as a proliferation of surfaces which are in a sense pretty vacant reminders that despite the essentially teleological nature of the Situationist project, it is now immobilised and its documents merely a contribution to culture as the spectacular remains of an abandoned revolutionary ideal.",1
988,The  tendency is to ignore value distinctions and to undermine qualitative difference popular and high art genres are presented side by side in a unified space or text.,1
989,There is an inside knowledge which makes this ‘coherent’ for those it.,1
990,"This presupposes the same audience separations, the same hierarchies, the same educational and class difference as before.",1
991,Frank Mort has commented on this kind of separation between the new intellectuals who are happy and confident to mix genre and ignore qualitative and semantic difference ‘because they already know the map of Western culture’ and are distinct from those ‘who do not carry with them those levels of cultural capital.’,1
992,"He adds to this: ‘In that sense postmodern discourse with its relativism, its denial of grand narratives and its refusal of questions of value, is a world tailor-made for the new metropolitan intellectual cadres.'",1
993,It therefore seems that ‘in a purely negative way’ the silence over the question of meaning in the Boston text and in the Scrapbook is perhaps not surprising —— it is an historically appropriate response to the disappearance of the SI.,1
994,"‘There is a sorrow in the Zeitgeist’ bemoans Lyotard, an inappropriateness in the metaphor of the ‘avant-garde’, and consequently a kind of absurdity attaching to the belief in art as a prefiguration of a global collectivist future.",1
995,That sorrow hangs over the discontinued struggles of the SI.,1
996,The belligerence of their message and the violence of their appeal to negation and revolt is now passed over in silence and their works appear they were blank sheets to the privileged audiences of the present day.,1
997,II,1
998,"What I have argued so far is that the Situationists are ill-served by these publications, and that this is partly the influence of a certain pessimism which haunts contemporary cultural politics.",1
999,What I want to argue now is that there is a sense in which the symptom of this pessimism exist in the movement itself.,1
1000,"The Situationists were idealists in the sense that they perceived themselves the spectacle, always managing to be ‘other-than-spectacular’, as Levin puts it, this became a pre-condition of Situationist practice.",1
1001,"Their self-image was that of the chosen few for whom the spectacle provided an inexhaustible supply of objects (and people) to hate, and whilst the apparent ease with which they targeted and disposed of their opposition often made good copy (the endless adventure, the scandal, etc.), there is a sense in which the hectoring tone of their documents became repetitive and wearisome.",1
1002,The effusions of Vaneigem have an air of mystical revelation which is even more intense in recent publications.,1
1003,Debord's political fatigue is less evident but his filmwork has finished and he refuses to permit distribution and screening of his work in this medium.,1
1004,Bernstein is now a journalist and works for a French newspaper.,1
1005,"There are, I think, just three statements which count as unequivocally critical comments on SI in the Scrapbook.",1
1006,"They appear in the documents section and therefore do not, we may take it, represent the views of the editors.",1
1007,"Firstly, Art & Language's piece ‘Ralph the Situationist’ expresses considerable misgivings about the Situationist project: ‘The texts are effectively incorrigible and self insulating…’; ‘…bland incoherence — a self-contradictory absurdity — a moral ground to give up reading and remembering…’, .",1
1008,"Whatever gave Francis, or whoever it was, the idea that Art $ Language had anything to do with the Situationists?",1
1009,On what basis is this reference made?,1
1010,"There is no evidence of SI influence in their work, which has quite different intellectual roots, and the article itself leaves no doubt as to the extent of their disapprobation.",1
1011,"Furthermore, the inclusion of three early works by the group in the exhibition (dating from the late sixties) reveals a make believe idea about an A $ L/SI connection.",1
1012,There was no such connection.,1
1013,"As late as 1970 members of A $ L, to my knowledge, had never heard of Debord, and if they had were not the least bit interested.",1
1014,The arbitrary inclusion of artworks in the exhibition is further evidence of a curatorial effort to construct a narrative of ‘situationism’.,1
1015,"The case for Merz, Pistoletto and Buren may be different, but it is not unreasonable to expect a rationale for the proclaimed indebtedness of Arte Povera and Conceptual Art to the Situationists.",1
1016,Nowhere in these publications are these connections argued for: they are merely dogmatically asserted.,1
1017,"Given the withering contempt expressed by the Situationists for ‘prositus’, one shudders to think what Debord .",1
1018,are going to make of the ‘quasi-situationists’ discovered in America by Elisabeth Sussmann.,1
1019,"On the basis of her understanding, it appears that any artist in the USA who uses the conventions of the mass media in such a way as to produce a critique of the media (and I can think of a good many) is veritably a ‘quasi-situationist’.",1
1020,"The desire to create a pseudo-history of the movement's afterlife may be good for business, and may have provided extra material for the book (I refer to the Boston text, see pp. 10–13) but it is not the purer aims of the Situationists outlined elsewhere in these and other texts.",1
1021,The second critical comment I came across in the Scrapbook was George Steiner's statement from the in 1967.,1
1022,"Steiner accepted that the Situationists had identified and accurately described the emptiness of everyday life and even accepts their pleas for subversion, but was very sour about what he described as the ‘depressingly banal’ prescriptions of Debord and the ‘turgid creed’of Vaneigem.",1
1023,"Christopher Gray, one of the small number of English members of the SI, is the third commentator I found to be not entirely sympathetic.",1
1024,His comments come from an anthology of Situationist writings he edited in 1974.,1
1025,Gray's comments evoke a kind of mystical disenchantment with the movement  which he found to be too focused on an intellectual critique of society.,1
1026,"‘There was’, he complains, ‘no concern whatever with either emotions or the body.",1
1027,The SI thought you just had to show how the nightmare worked and everyone would wake up.,1
1028,Their quest was for the perfect formula.',1
1029,The history of the SI is in some ways a struggle for recognition (despite Debord's evasions) sustained by a radically negative critique which ultimately failed to find a middle way between Hegelian metaphysics and the dynamics of political organisation in the pursuit of its utopian objectives.,1
1030,The declamatory style of writing (which now seems dated) too often obscured the probity of the Situationist's critique of the alienating and manipulative effects of late capitalism and its creation of pseudo-needs.,1
1031,The movement's critique proclaimed a uniqueness and originality for its discoveries to which it was never entitled and which served only to reinforce the self-deluding image of its own power and influence in the world.,1
1032,Anti-authoritarian leftism and the critique of bureaucratic socialism had been well established before the foundation of the SI in 1957.,1
1033,The rejection of trade unionism was a common demand amongst anarchists and libertarian socialists.,1
1034,At the end of her life Rosa Luxembourg called for the abolishment of trade unions and promoted the view that workers' councils were essential organisations in the establishment of socialism.,1
1035,More generally the idea of the inseparability of cultural and political revolution has a long history within the libertarian tradition with its roots in revolutionary Romanticism.,1
1036,"The more direct inspiration for the Situationists was the Dada-Lettrist connection which provided the aesthetic and political basis for their adoption of non-cognitive methods of expression (automatism, chance and other depersonalising techniques of production) and also led to the definition of some key terms in their vocabulary.",1
1037,The critique of scientific socialism and economism has a major place in Marxist debate in the twentieth century.,1
1038,"The Situationists, contribution to this was negligible.",1
1039,"The Frankfurt School's Marxian approach to cultural criticism, and production and the social effects of technology and the culture industries pre-dates the writings of Debord, and yet, despite its relative lack of revolutionary fervour remains a far more wide-ranging and thoroughgoing critique of the field.",1
1040,"The conjunction of passion and knowledge, of libertarianism and planning, of feeling and thought are conventional oppositions in post-Enlightenment thought which have also bedevilled Marxism.",1
1041,The more orthodox theorists in this tradition have preserved this separation along the lines of a Romanticist/Utilitarian split.,1
1042,"Others have sought a reconciliation of the positions that these terms represent, and there is an abundance of literature which examines this relationship in advance of the Situationists.",1
1043,"If the Situationist project is flawed, as I believe it is, it is not because antecedent theories of libertarians, Marxists and Council Communists are ignored by them, but rather because they lacked the will to build on this tradition a systematic utopianism consisting of critique and plausible projections into the future.",1
1044,"Like the Surrealists before them, their transcendence of alienation remains abstractly utopian.",1
1045,"Despite revolutionary zeal, or perhaps it, they sought immediate compensations for the miseries of daily life, and spontaneous methods of attack which they mistook for political strategy.",1
1046,The Situationists' strategy consisted of an exploratory utopianism — a kind of heuristic projection of a future society.,1
1047,"Raymond Williams has remarked that the danger of the heuristic utopia is that it ‘can settle into isolated and sentimental desire, a means of living with alienation’.",1
1048,Another Surrealist inheritance which distances Situationists from the more radical utopians is their blanket condemnation of work.,1
1049,‘Never work!’ announced the Surrealists.,1
1050,It is an amusing quip (especially for those with private means) and makes joyful and nonsensical graffiti.,1
1051,But what does it mean?,1
1052,"Obviously it is an incitement to refusal, and an indictment of alienated labour.",1
1053,"The refusal is as understandable as it is naive, but seems to constitute at the same time what amounts to an abnegation of intellectual curiosity about human needs.",1
1054,Its political inflexion contests the middle-class work ethic which is the main purpose of its message.,1
1055,"The aristocracy, for its part, has never needed to be convinced of the importance of not working.",1
1056,"For other theorists William Morris, the concept of work is not considered negatively.",1
1057,Indeed; for Morris and other Marxists the nature of work necessarily changes in the process of social transformation.,1
1058,Marx defined labour as ‘human sensuous activity’.,1
1059,Lukács claimed that labour became the model for any social practice.,1
1060,The plea for an understanding of ‘totality’ in Situationist writing derives from Lukács and Marx whose critique of ‘separation’is directed exactly at the work/leisure distinction.,1
1061,"Asger Jorn's interest in folk cultures and tribal societies which lacked a notion of ‘art’ as a distinct intellectual practice separated from the common culture, was based on an understanding of the extent to which the spheres of art and work have become conflicting practices within bourgeois relations of production.",1
1062,Despite this the common tendency in SI writing on most forms of directed or purposeful activity (agitation or ‘destructive creativity') is negative.,1
1063,The aristocratic disdain for manual labour has its counterpart in the Situationist’ attitude to the working class considered as the moronised victims of the spectacle.,1
1064,In contrast the Situationists' notion of pleasure is a negation of work in almost every sense of the word — a kind of involuntary idleness in the land of Cockaigne.,1
1065,Their notion of pleasure is indistinguishable from a sixties Zeitgeist.,1
1066,"Its meaning is inadequately theorised and remains largely at the  level of common sense, a crude alternative to the repressive order of work.",1
1067,Situationist texts are widely available (and with these publications adding to the list) it is ironic that they seem less crucial than they once did.,1
1068,"Their appeal in the past was partly attributable to the popular texture of some aspects of the writing, its accessibility and its festive and irreverent politics.",1
1069,"These writings appealed essentially to a generation of students bored with academic life and attracted by the street credibility of the Situationists, and often provided students with the dubious pleasure of being flattered and insulted at the same time.",1
1070,The Situationist lifestyle (it could be imagined) had some influence on the hippy sub-culture in the late sixties and punk ideology in the seventies in Britain.,1
1071,"Situationist influence was more menacingly felt in France especially in the universities, although it has to be said that their influence upon the events of May 1968 has been exaggerated.",1
1072,", however, the legacy of the movement remained less obviously political, and restricted in its appeal to fairly specific audiences in the cultural milieu and especially the visual arts.",1
1073,"Indeed, the extent to which the Situationist influence has flourished in the spheres of art and popular culture is noteworthy and contrasts with the absence of the movement's influence in other domains.",1
1074,"The uneven profile of the Situationist group and its existential fragmentation together with the eclectic and impromptu formal character of the artefacts they produced, as I have suggested above, make it an ideal type for the postmodernist critic.",1
1075,"The Situationists' rejection of the classical model of left-wing monumentalism, and their apparent lack of commitment to the historical overview or the grand narrative is consistent with postmodernism.",1
1076,"Moreover, the freedom with which they juxtapose theory and humour, and plagiarise for artistic effect suggests strong affinity with the postmodern.",1
1077,The decline of the meta-narrative aphoristic models of philosophical expression (following Feuerbach and Nietzche) has been the favoured form of the Situationists.,1
1078,The fact that Baudrillard's name has been linked with the Situationists should not be held against them.,1
1079,"Nevertheless, the de-Marxisation of their project by him and the ‘death of the social’ which he has announced should alert us to the doubts raised by Raymond Williams on the issue of certain types of Utopianism.",1
1080,"The concept of the spectacle is an effective term which now has a wide currency, but perhaps only in a sense which approximates its use by the Situationists.",1
1081,"The historical period which has seen its political devaluation is one in which political optimism has become unfashionable, which perhaps is one way of explaining the retrospective or merely historicist character of the Situationist exhibition, and the books I have reviewed.",1
1082,"We have seen a shift from the utopianism of the 1960s to a culture of nostalgia and, as with the more dystopian elements in postmodernism, the exhibition and the books which accompany it look backward in a search for appearances they were compensatory fantasies substituting for a forgotten dream.",1
1,HOMICIDE,2
2,This chapter deals with the approach of the criminal law to behaviour which causes or risks causing death.,2
3,"Murder, manslaughter, and several other offences are discussed, and one recurrent issue here is whether English law responds proportionately to the different degrees of culpability manifested in cases where death is caused.",2
4,7.1 DEATH AND FINALITY,2
5,"For practical purposes, the culpable causing of another person's death may fairly be regarded as the most serious offence in the criminal calendar.",2
6,"There is an argument that treason is a more serious offence, since it strikes at the very foundations of the State and its social organizations, but treason is so rare that it is surely permissible to treat homicide as the most serious form of crime.",2
7,"The reason for this is not difficult to find: the harm caused by many other crimes is remediable to a degree, whereas the harm caused by homicide is absolutely irremediable.",2
8,"Even in crimes of violence which leave some permanent physical disfigurement or psychological effects, the victim retains his or her life and, therefore, the possibility of further pleasures and achievements, whereas death is final.",2
9,"This finality makes it proper to regard death as the most serious harm that may be inflicted on another, and to regard a person who chooses to inflict that harm as the most culpable of offenders, in the absence of some excuse or justification.",2
10,"Although many deaths arise from natural causes, and many others from illnesses and diseases, each year sees a large number of deaths caused by ‘accidents’, and also a number caused by acts or omissions which amount to some form of homicide in English law.",2
11,"For 1987 the statistics show that there were some 20,000 accidental deaths, of which some 7,000 occurred in the home, 6,000 at work, and 5,000 on the roads.",2
12,"By comparison, the number of deaths recorded as criminal homicide was 600, which includes all the  murders and manslaughters.",2
13,"This figure is relatively small when compared with many American cities, but that is no cause for satisfaction.",2
14,There are still awkward questions to be confronted.,2
15,", are we satisfied that the 600 deaths recorded as homicide are in fact more culpable than all, or even most, of the deaths recorded as accidents?",2
16,"In other words, does English criminal law pick out the most heinous forms of killing as murders and manslaughters, or are the boundaries frozen by tradition?",2
17,Another question is whether the criminal law ought not to be wider in its application to activities which carry some risk of causing death than in other spheres.,2
18,"Thus, it would be excessive to sweep large numbers of the deaths now recorded as ‘accidents’ into the law of homicide, there may be sufficient justification for creating or enforcing offences designed to ensure safe conditions of work, safe goods, safe buildings, .",2
19,It was argued in Chapter 2 that the criminal law ought to spread its net wider where the potential harm is greater.,2
20,"It will be seen that English law does this a point, and in the process seems to accept social-defence arguments as reasons for departing from several of the principles set out in Chapter 3.",2
21,7.2 REQUIREMENTS OF CRIMINAL HOMICIDE,2
22,"English law distinguishes between the offences of murder and manslaughter, as we shall see, but the two crimes do have certain common elements.",2
23,It must be proved that the defendant's act or omission caused the death of the victim within a year and a day.,2
24,(The requirements of causation in the criminal law are discussed elsewhere.),2
25,"The ‘year and a day’ rule is a legacy of times when medical science was so rudimentary that, if there was a substantial lapse of time between injury and death, it was unsafe to pronounce on whether the defendant's conduct or some other event caused the death.",2
26,"Nowadays the problem is quite the reverse: medical science is generally able to determine whether D's conduct caused the death, and innovations life-support machines mean that life can be prolonged for months and years in some instances.",2
27,"In one recent case the victim of a stabbing died two and a half years after  the incident, having been kept on a life-support machine for almost the entire time.",2
28,"In principle, it seems unjust that a homicide conviction should not be possible in such a case, if all the other elements can be established and only the ‘year and a day’ rule stands in the way.",2
29,"But the rule was confirmed by the Criminal Law Revision Committee in 1980, on the ground that a defendant should not be left in peril of a homicide conviction indefinitely.",2
30,Surely prosecutorial discretion should be enough to prevent unfair convictions years after the event.,2
31,The rule itself is accord with modern medical conditions and should be abolished.,2
32,DEFINING MURDER: THE INCLUSIONARY QUESTION,2
33,(a) The Procedural Context,2
34,"If causing death is to be regarded as the most serious harm that can be inflicted, it would seem to follow that the most blameworthy form of homicide should result in the highest sentences imposed by the courts.",2
35,"Indeed, many systems of criminal law impose a mandatory sentence for murder (or whatever the highest form of homicide is called in that system).",2
36,In some jurisdictions this is a mandatory sentence of death.,2
37,"In others, those in the United Kingdom, it is the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment.",2
38,"Why should this penalty be mandatory, and not at the discretion of the court as in other offences?",2
39,One argument the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment is that it amounts to a symbolic indication of the unique heinousness of murder.,2
40,"It places the offender under the State's control, , for the remainder of his or her life.",2
41,"This is often linked with a supposed denunciatory effect — the idea that the mandatory life sentence denounces murder as emphatically as possible — and with a supposed general deterrent effect, in declaring that there is no mitigation of sentence available for this crime.",2
42,It might also be argued that the mandatory life sentence makes a substantial contribution to public safety.,2
43,"None of these arguments is notably strong, conclusive.",2
44,"The mandatory penalty does indeed serve to mark out murder from other crimes, but whether the definition of murder is  sufficiently refined to capture the worst killings, and only the worst killings, remains to be discussed below.",2
45,"Whether the life sentence is regarded as a sufficient denunciation in society depends on the public's perception of what life imprisonment means: if it is widely believed that it results in an average of nine years' imprisonment, the effect will be somewhat blunted.",2
46,"The same applies to the general deterrent argument: its effectiveness depends on whether the penalty for murder affects the calculations of potential killers , and, if it does, whether life imprisonment is seen as significantly more or less severe than the alternative of a long, fixed-term sentence.",2
47,"public protection, this depends on executive decisions release; it fails to take into account whether it is necessary for public protection to keep ‘lifers’ in for so long.",2
48,"This brings the discussion to a crucial point: what does the sentence of life imprisonment mean in practice, and what would be the alternative?",2
49,"What it means is that the time of release from prison is determined by the Home Secretary, on the advice of the Parole Board and the Lord Chief Justice, by the judge at the trial.",2
50,"In procedural terms, therefore, the life sentence involves a transfer of function: normally it is the judge who determines the sentence (or its upper limit, since earlier release on parole may be possible), whereas a life sentence entrusts that function to the executive, who must first ascertain the opinions of the Lord Chief Justice and the trial judge.",2
51,"The Home Office is not bound by those opinions, and appears to depart from them frequently.",2
52,"In 1983 the Home Secretary imposed restrictions on the release of persons serving life for murders of police- and prison-officers, terrorist killings, murder during robbery, and the sadistic or sexual murder of young children, fixing a minimum of twenty years' imprisonment for these offenders.",2
53,"Whatever the justifications for introducing this policy, it serves to underline the fact that sentencing in murder cases is enacted without each case being considered individually, after hearing representations from the offender's counsel, and without a sentence announced in court and appeal.",2
54,", the executive takes decisions to release some murderers after only a few years and to keep others in prison for extremely long periods.",2
55,"Should those decisions not be taken by the courts, in  the same way as other sentencing decisions?",2
56,The answer sometimes given is that murderers should be treated differently because they are particularly dangerous: anyone who chooses to kill once can choose to kill again.,2
57,"But this argument will seem less persuasive when we have discussed cases of manslaughter diminished responsibility: where a murder is reduced to manslaughter, the judge has a wide sentencing discretion and may, the facts of the case, select a determinate prison sentence, a hospital order, or life imprisonment.",2
58,"Those who kill and are convicted of manslaughter diminished responsibility are no less dangerous than those convicted of murder, and yet the judge has sentencing discretion in one case and not in the other.",2
59,Considerations of this kind have led the House of Lords Select Committee on Murder and Life Imprisonment to recommend the abolition of the mandatory sentence for murder.,2
60,"In its place would be a sentencing discretion, which judges would use, in many cases, to mark the relative heinousness of the murder by a determinate prison sentence.",2
61,"In cases where life imprisonment was thought to be the appropriate sentence, the trial judge would still specify — in open court — the number of years to be spent in prison, taking the gravity of the offence into account, and release would be determined by a judicial tribunal.",2
62,Such a reform would bring improvements in natural justice without loss of public protection.,2
63,(b) Degrees of Homicide,2
64,"English criminal law has two degrees of homicide, murder and manslaughter.",2
65,"Many American jurisdictions have three degrees of murder — first-degree murder, requiring premeditation, and second- and third-degree murder, covering lesser shades of culpability.",2
66,"In England there has been a proposal that we should do away with all these distinctions, leaving a single offence of criminal homicide.",2
67,"That proposal, if implemented, would shift almost all the decision-making in homicide cases from the trial to the sentencing stage: the  only issue of any consequence in most cases would be the sentence to be imposed, and all the distinctions now drawn at the stage of criminal liability would be reflected in the sentence alone.",2
68,"The jury would have no role in most homicide cases, since a plea of guilty would be the norm.",2
69,"Contrast this with the position in jurisdictions where there are three or more degrees of homicide: pleas of guilty to first- and second-degree murders would be less frequent, since there would be the possibility of argument in court (if no bargain was struck beforehand between prosecution and defence), and the defence might succeed in persuading the jury to reduce the degree of the killing.",2
70,"Moreover, the borderlines between the various degrees would raise questions of law, which would provide much opportunity for legal argument and for appeals.",2
71,"The result would be that killings were classified and labelled in a more refined way, but at the cost of lengthy trials and mounting legal-aid bills.",2
72,That cost is not difficult to justify where capital punishment is the penalty for first-degree murder.,2
73,"Where there is no capital punishment, however, the question of how many degrees of homicide it is desirable to have calls for careful weighing of the principle of fair labelling (see Chapter 3.3 (l)) against the cost and time arguments mobilised by the policy of efficient administration (see Chapter 3.3 (m)).",2
74,The structure of the English law of homicide is rather strange.,2
75,"Although there are two offences, murder and manslaughter, the latter includes two distinct varieties: ‘voluntary’ manslaughter (killings which would be murder the existence of defined extenuating circumstances); and ‘involuntary’manslaughter (killings for which there is no need to prove any awareness of the risk of death being caused, but for which there is thought to be sufficient fault to justify criminal liability).",2
76,The arguments therefore tend to focus on three borderline questions: What is the minimum fault required for conviction of murder?,2
77,What conditions are needed to reduce murder to manslaughter?,2
78,And what is the minimum fault required for a conviction of manslaughter.,2
79,(c) Requirements for Murder,2
80,"In English criminal law there are now two alternative fault requirements for murder: an intent to kill, or an intent to cause grievous bodily harm.",2
81,What do these requirements mean?,2
82,"Do they extend the definition of murder too far, or are they too narrow.",2
83,"Intent to kill may be regarded as the most obvious and indisputable form of fault element for murder, but to some extent that depends  on the meaning of ‘intent’.",2
84,"This has been the subject of a number of House of Lords decisions, and yet the definition is still not clear and settled.",2
85,"Probably the most accurate statement would be that a person to kill if it is his or her purpose to kill by the act or omission charged, or if he or she foresees that death is practically certain to follow from that act or omission.",2
86,"In this way, both purpose and foresight of practical certainty are regarded as part of the definition of intent, although there are other statements suggesting that foresight of practical or ‘virtual’ certainty is merely evidence from which intent may be inferred.",2
87,How would this test be applied?,2
88,"In many cases the word ‘intent’ is used without elaboration, but there are some for which a full explanation of the meaning of intention is necessary.",2
89,"A fairly typical set of facts is provided by (1986), where D had a grudge against a woman and had threatened to ‘burn her out’.",2
90,"One night he went to her house, poured paraffin through the letter-box and the front door, and set it alight.",2
91,One of the woman's children died in the ensuing fire.,2
92,"When asked why he did it, D replied: ‘Just to wake her up and frighten her.’",2
93,"A defence of this kind, a claim that the purpose was only to frighten and not to cause harm, requires the full definition to be put to the jury.",2
94,"The question is: granted that D's purpose was to frighten, did he nonetheless realize that it was practically certain that his act would cause death or grievous bodily harm to someone?",2
95,The jury should answer this by drawing inferences from the evidence in the case and from the surrounding circumstances.,2
96,"What about the alternative element in the definition, an intent to cause grievous bodily harm?",2
97,"This has considerable practical importance, since this is all that the prosecution has to prove to obtain a verdict of guilty of murder.",2
98,"It must be shown that the defendant intended (which, again, includes both purpose and awareness of practical certainty) to cause really serious injury to someone.",2
99,"The House of Lords confirmed this rule in (1981): D struck his victim on the head a number of times with a chair, causing injuries from which the victim died a week later.",2
100,"D maintained throughout that he had not intended to kill, but there was evidence from which the jury could infer — and did infer — that he intended to cause grievous bodily harm.",2
101,"The House of Lords  upheld D's conviction for murder: an intent to cause really serious injury is sufficient for murder, without any proof that the defendant intended, or even contemplated, the possibility that death would result.",2
102,Does the ‘grievous bodily harm’ rule extend the definition of murder too far?,2
103,"If the point of distinguishing murder from manslaughter is to mark out the most heinous group of killings for the extra stigma of a murder conviction, it can be argued that the ‘grievous bodily harm’ rule draws the line too low.",2
104,"principle, the rule requires justification because it departs from the principle of correspondence (see Chapter 5.2(a)), namely that the fault element in a crime should relate to the consequences prohibited by that crime.",2
105,"By allowing an intent to cause grievous bodily harm to suffice for a murder conviction, the law is violating a general principle, turning the most serious of its offences into a constructive crime.",2
106,Why should it be necessary to ‘construct’ a murder conviction this lesser intent?,2
107,"There are arguments this: death is final, murder is the gravest crime, and there is no significant moral difference between someone who chooses to cause really serious injury and someone who sets out to kill.",2
108,"can predict whether a serious injury will result in death — that may depend on the victim's physique, on the speed of an ambulance, on the distance from the hospital, and on a range of other medical and individual matters.",2
109,"If one person chooses to cause serious injury to another, it should be presumed that he or she realizes that there is always a risk of death, and such cases show a sufficiently wanton disregard for life warrant the label ‘murder’ if death results.",2
110,"The counter-arguments, which would uphold the principle of correspondence, are that breach of that principle is unnecessary when the amplitude of the crime of manslaughter lies beneath murder, and also that the definition of grievous bodily harm includes a number of injuries which are most unlikely to put the victim's life at risk.",2
111,"In the leading case of Lord Edmund-Davies (dissenting) gave the example of breaking someone's arm: that is a really serious injury, but one which is unlikely to endanger the victim's life.",2
112,So in practice the ‘grievous bodily harm’ rule goes further than the arguments of its protagonists would support.,2
113,"Would it be right, then, to confine the fault element in murder to an intent to kill?",2
114,"That would have the merit of simplicity, but would  it strike the right note socially?",2
115,"There are powerful arguments saying that there are other killings where an intent to kill cannot be established, and yet where the moral or social culpability is equal to that in most intentional killings.",2
116,", one cannot be adamant about whether they merit the label ‘murder’, because that is a question of drawing the line between murder and manslaughter, which is not susceptible of any precise resolution.",2
117,It is hard to argue conclusively that the category of murder should be smaller or larger (unless the death penalty or a mandatory life sentence follows); it is a question of social judgment.,2
118,Let us briefly consider some of the possibilities.,2
119,The fault element for many serious offences is intent or recklessness: why should this not suffice for murder?,2
120,The question is whether all killings in which the defendant is aware of the risk of death are sufficiently serious to warrant the term ‘murder’.,2
121,"One answer sometimes given is that they are not, because a driver who overtakes on a bend, knowingly taking the risk that there is a car travelling in the opposite direction, should not be labelled a murderer if a collision and death happen to ensue.",2
122,This example assumes that a sympathy for motorists with overwhelm any tendency to logical analysis.,2
123,One might ask whether motorists are ever justified in knowingly taking risks with other people's lives.,2
124,"Yet if the example is modified , the overtaking is on a country road at night and the risk is known to be slight, it becomes questionable whether the causing of death in these circumstances should be labelled in the same way as intentional killings.",2
125,This is not to suggest that motorists should be treated differently.,2
126,"The point is rather that, knowingly taking risks with other people's lives is usually unjustifiable, taking a slight risk is less serious than intentionally causing death.",2
127,"In discussing the boundaries of murder, we are concerned with classification, not exculpation.",2
128,"To classify all reckless killings as murder might be too broad, but the point remains that some reckless killings may be thought no less heinous than intentional killings.",2
129,Can a satisfactory line be drawn here?,2
130,One approach would be to draw the line by reference to the degree of probability.,2
131,Murder is committed in those situations where D caused death by an act or omission which he knew had death as the probable or highly probable result.,2
132,A version of this test of foresight of high probability is used in several other European  countries; it was introduced into English law by the decision in ,2
133,"(1975), but abandoned in (1985) on grounds of uncertainty.",2
134,A second approach is to frame the law in such a way as to make it clear that the court should make a moral judgment on the gravity of the defendant's conduct.,2
135,Section 210.2 of the Model Penal Code includes within murder those reckless killings which manifest ‘extreme indifference to the value of human life’.,2
136,"Scots law treats as murder killings with ‘wicked recklessness’, a phrase which directs the court's attention to the circumstances of the killing.",2
137,"Both the Model Penal Code test and the Scots test may be reduced to circularity, however, for when one asks how extreme or how wicked the recklessness should be, the only possible answer is: ‘wicked or extreme enough to justify the stigma of a murder conviction’.",2
138,"Admittedly, the Model Penal Code does contain a list of circumstances which may amount to extreme indifference, which assists the courts and increases the predictability of verdicts in a way that Scots law does not, but the essence of both approaches is that there is no precise way of describing those non-intentional killings which are as heinous as intentional killings.",2
139,"Their protagonists argue that the law of murder is so important socially that derogation from the principle of maximum certainty should be allowed more accurate labelling by the courts; opponents argue that the principle of maximum certainty is needed here specifically to reduce the risk of verdicts based on discriminatory or irrelevant factors, distaste for the defendant's background, allegiance, or other activities.",2
140,"A third, more precise formulation derives from the recommendations of the Criminal Law Revision Committee in 1980, namely, that a killing should be classified as murder in those situations where there is an intention to cause serious injury coupled with awareness of the risk of death.",2
141,"Neither an intention to cause serious injury  nor recklessness death should be sufficient on its own, but together they restrict , producing a test which both satisfies the criterion of certainty and marks out some heinous but non-intended killings.",2
142,"A fourth approach, adopted by English law until 1957 and still in force in many American jurisdictions, is some form of felony-murder rule: anyone who kills during the course of a felony (or, more restrictively, a serious crime of violence) or whilst resisting arrest should be convicted of murder.",2
143,"Thus stated, there is no reference to the defendant's intention or awareness of the risks: the fact that D has chosen to commit rape, robbery, or another serious offence, and has caused death thereby, is held to constitute sufficient moral grounds for placing the killing in the highest category.",2
144,"Plainly, this is a form of constructive criminal liability: the murder conviction is constructed the ingredients of a lesser offence.",2
145,"Presumably the justification is that D has already crossed a high moral/social threshold in choosing to commit such a serious offence, and should therefore be held liable for whatever consequences ensue, however unforeseeable they may be.",2
146,"The objections would be reduced if awareness of the risk of death was also required: in other words, if the test were the commission of a serious offence of violence plus recklessness death.",2
147,"The effect of that test would be to pick out those reckless killings which occurred when D had already manifested substantial moral and legal culpability, and to classify them as murder.",2
148,"Four alternative approaches have been described, and many others could be listed.",2
149,"The point is that the traditional concepts of intention and recklessness do not, of themselves, appear to be sufficiently well focused to mark out those killings which are the most heinous.",2
150,The law must resort to some kind of moral and social evaluation of conduct if it is to identify and separate out the most heinous killings.,2
151,"Many people might think that a person who causes death whilst using an unlawfully held firearm or explosives ought to be convicted of murder because there is, generally speaking, no excuse for using such dangerous equipment.",2
152,"Some of the people thus covered would be armed robbers, others would be terrorists.",2
153,"The armed robber might say that he had no intention of using the firearm, that he carried it with him simply to frighten the victim, and  that it went off accidentally: if the jury believes that, should he be convicted of murder?",2
154,"The terrorist might say that he gave sufficient warning of the bomb for the area to be cleared, and that it was unforeseeable that a deaf person should remain on the premises and be killed in the explosion, which was intended only to cause damage.",2
155,"If the jury believes that, should he be convicted of murder?",2
156,It is possible that juries would prefer to convict of murder in such cases so as to register their abhorrence of the defendant's activities .,2
157,"If so, this would suggest a social preference for regarding killings of these kinds as among the worst the circumstances in which they occur, because of the defendant's awareness of the possible consequences.",2
158,"However, the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, which reviewed the matter thoroughly in the early 1950s, and later law-reform committees have accorded preference to the ‘general principle’ that ‘persons ought not to be punished for consequences of their acts which they did not intend or foresee’.",2
159,"A conviction for manslaughter would be sufficient to mark the gravity of those cases in which D was not aware of the risk of death, and the court would have ample discretion in sentencing to reflect the blameworthiness of D's conduct.",2
160,"However, there would have to be clear parameters of sentencing to avoid the intrusion of discriminatory or irrelevant factors at this stage.",2
161,To summarize: the existing English law classifies as murder those killings where there was an intent to kill or an intent to cause grievous bodily harm.,2
162,"The reason for distinguishing between murder and manslaughter must be to identify and to label the most heinous killings as murder, and it has been questioned whether English law succeeds in this.",2
163,"There are issues of general principle at stake, but it is also true to say that there can be no place in which to draw the line.",2
164,"The issue assumes special significance when conviction for murder carries a mandatory penalty, particularly when that penalty is death.",2
165,7.4 DEFINING MURDER: THE EXCLUSIONARY QUESTION,2
166,"Even in a legal system which had the narrowest of definitions of murder — say, premeditated intention to kill — there would still be an argument that some cases which fulfil that criterion should have their label reduced from murder to manslaughter extenuating circumstances.",2
167,"Just as the discussion of the aspect of the definition of murder travelled beyond the concepts of intent and recklessness, so the discussion of the aspect (i.e. which killings fulfilling the definition should be classified as manslaughter murder?) must consider the circumstances in which the killing took place and the culpability of the killer.",2
168,(a) The Mandatory Penalty,2
169,It is sometimes argued that the main reason for allowing such matters as provocation to reduce murder to manslaughter is to avoid the mandatory penalty for murder.,2
170,"Thus, if the mandatory penalty were abolished, it would be sufficient to take account of provocation when sentencing for murder.",2
171,This argument neglects the symbolic function of the labels applied by the law and by courts to criminal conduct.,2
172,"Surely it is possible that a jury might decline to convict of murder a person who intentionally killed under gross provocation, they knew that the judge could give a lenient sentence, because they wished to signify the reduction in the defendant's culpability by using the less stigmatic label of manslaughter.",2
173,Since there are two offences — and particularly in jurisdictions where there are three or more grades of homicide — surely it is right and proper to use the lesser offence to mark significant differences in culpability.,2
174,This may be seen as an application of the principle of fair labelling.,2
175,"The lesser verdict may also assist the judge in sentencing, and help the public to understand the sentence imposed.",2
176,"However, this reasoning is not accepted in English law for non-homicide offences, and provocation is not generally allowed to reduce a more serious offence to a less serious offence — probably for reasons associated with the policy of efficient administration (see Chapter 3.3(m)), which the significance of death is thought to outweigh in homicide cases.",2
177,(b) Manslaughter upon Provocation,2
178,"Provoked killings are generally thought to be less heinous than unprovoked killings, and provocation has long been accepted as a ground for reducing to manslaughter a killing which would otherwise fulfil the definition of murder.",2
179,"there are cases where the provocation is so gross and so strong that a court imposes a very short prison sentence or even a suspended sentence for the manslaughter — typically, cases where a wife, son, or daughter kills a persistently bullying husband or father — and such cases raise the more general question of whether provocation should ever be a complete defence to homicide or to other crimes.",2
180,That question was discussed in Chapter 6.5 above.,2
181,"The issue here is whether provocation should remain a qualified defence to murder, and, if so, how far it should extend.",2
182,"In English law the doctrine of provocation has two main elements, both of which are laid down in section 3 of the Homicide Act 1957.",2
183,"First, there must be evidence that D was provoked to lose self-control and kill.",2
184,"Second, the jury must decide whether the provocation was enough to make a reasonable man do as D did.",2
185,"D is not required to prove any of this: in a murder trial, if there is sufficient evidence that D was provoked to lose self-control, the judge is bound to leave provocation to the jury, and the burden of disproving it beyond reasonable doubt lies upon the prosecution.",2
186,(i).,2
187,The first requirement of the qualified defence of provocation is predominantly subjective — evidence that D was provoked to lose self-control and kill.,2
188,"This requirement contributes to the excusing element in the provocation doctrine, the idea being that a person who has lost self-control is less responsible for subsequent conduct.",2
189,"Without this element, there would be no way of excluding planned revenge killings, and the argument is that they should be excluded from the defence because a person who plans a response to an affront or a wrong ought to ensure that the response conforms with the law.",2
190,"The genuinely provoked killer, on the other hand, is in such a disturbed state of mind that such calculation does not occur.",2
191,How disturbed does this state of mind have to be?,2
192,The concept of loss of self-control has received little close attention from lawyers.,2
193,"Such phrases as ‘loss of temper’ or ‘heat of passion’are treated  as useful synonyms, for which angry or apparently uncontrolled reactions may be treated as evidence.",2
194,"One matter which is viewed as significant is a short space of time between the provocation and the killing, and there are some judicial statements which treat this as a matter of law: the loss of self-control must, it is sometimes held, be ‘sudden and temporary’.",2
195,"Thus in (1982) there had been considerable ill-treatment and violence by the deceased towards D and his girlfriend, and this led them eventually to plan and carry out a night-time raid on the deceased's flat, during which they attacked and killed him.",2
196,"The Court of Appeal confirmed that the defence of provocation was unavailable; D had lost his self-control at the time, it was hardly a sudden and temporary response to an act of the deceased, who was asleep when D struck him.",2
197,"Differing slightly from are the many cases where ‘cumulative provocation’ has been directed towards D over a period of time, and then some minor act sparks off the loss of self-control and killing.",2
198,"In cases of this kind (which rarely come before the Court of Appeal except on appeal against sentence), the last act of the provoker, minor in itself, may be placed in the context of the previous provocation, and may itself be treated as sufficient to show that the loss of self-control was ‘sudden and temporary’.",2
199,"However, there is no reference to a requirement of ‘suddenness’ in the Homicide Act 1957, and the courts have in effect restricted the defence to people with certain kinds of temperament.",2
200,"It is one thing to exclude cases like from the defence — the gap of some five days between provocation and killing savours of considered revenge; it is another thing to exclude defendants with slow-burning temperaments, who do not react to an insult or wrong, but go away and then react after hours of festering anger.",2
201,"Should a court be prevented from hearing and acting on evidence that, despite the lapse of a few hours, a defendant's temperament was such that it is fair to say that he or she was provoked to lose self-control, and that it was not calculated revenge?",2
202,"The Homicide Act requires evidence that D was to lose self-control: this is wide enough to include things said or done by persons the deceased, and acts done against persons D (e.g. where D is provoked to kill someone who has just committed a sexual offence upon D's son, daughter, wife, etc.).",2
203,But  the word ‘provoked’ does seem to require a human act a natural event which leads D to lose self-control.,2
204,"Thus, in (1986), the crying of a 17-day-old child was held to be sufficient to fall within the requirement (such an infant is not aware of the significance of what he or she is doing), whereas someone who loses self-control after a storm or explosion has destroyed his property would be outside the requirement.",2
205,These restrictions show that the subjective element is merely preparing the ground for the objective element; it is not part of a broader defence of emotional pressure of the kind discussed in Chapter 6.5(c) above.,2
206,(ii).,2
207,"Once the court is satisfied that there is evidence that D was provoked to lose self-control, it must go on to consider the second requirement: was the provocation enough to make a reasonable man do as D did?",2
208,This is English law's rather clumsy attempt to reflect the element of partial justification in the doctrine of provocation.,2
209,"The clumsiness is evident in the standard of ‘the reasonable man’, an anthropomorphic (and male) standard which might be taken to suggest a paragon of virtue if it were not for the context of partially exculpating a killing by such a person.",2
210,"The underlying point is that it is not every act of provocation which should be allowed to reduce murder to manslaughter, but only those serious enough to unbalance the behaviour of a person with reasonable self-control.",2
211,"In earlier times the judge would rule on the sufficiency of the provocation, and the result of this was rather narrow and legalistic categories of sufficiency (e.g. violence or finding a spouse in adultery were enough, but words or a confession of adultery were not).",2
212,"The Homicide Act 1957 deprived judges of their power to give authoritative rulings on the sufficiency of provocation, and the question must now be left to the jury, which should apply the test of the ‘reasonable man’ to everything said or done before the killing which might amount to provocation.",2
213,"There appears to be no time-limit on the matters to be considered, not only the final act but a whole course of conduct may be taken into account.",2
214,"If this is correct, it goes some way towards dealing with cases of ‘cumulative provocation’, and towards a broader defence of emotional pressure.",2
215,How has the ‘reasonable man’ test been interpreted by the courts?,2
216,In ,2
217,"(1954) D, who was sexually impotent, was taunted about his impotence and kicked in the groin by a prostitute with whom he had been attempting to have sexual intercourse, whereupon he lost self-control and killed her.",2
218,"The House of Lords held that the jury should consider the effect of these acts on a reasonable man, without regard to the sexual impotence.",2
219,"The court seemed to be afraid that if it allowed the jury to take account of one characteristic, sexual impotence, then it would be illogical to direct them not to take account of another characteristic, irascibility or bad temper.",2
220,"It is no less illogical, however, to ask a jury to consider the effect of taunts of impotence on a reasonable person who is impotent, and the approach was overruled by the House of Lords in ",2
221,(1978).,2
222,"A court should now consider the effect of the provocation on ‘a person having the power of self-control to be expected of an ordinary person of the sex and age of the accused, but in other respects sharing such of the accused's characteristics as they think would affect the gravity of the provocation to him’.",2
223,"This test demonstrates that the illogicality alleged in does not exist: some characteristics of each individual defendant must be considered by the jury in assessing the gravity of the provocation, but the level of self-control must be kept constant.",2
224,"Bad temper could not be taken into account, for that is plainly inconsistent with the standard of reasonable self-control.",2
225,"Mental imbalance should also be excluded, since that seems inconsistent with the idea of an ‘ordinary person’, and the defence should be one of diminished responsibility.",2
226,"Intoxication is plainly outside the test: if the provocation was not enough to lead an ordinary sober person to do as D did, then the essence of D's defence is intoxication provocation.",2
227,"The criteria adopted by the Court of Appeal in (1980) were that courts should only take account of characteristics with which the provocation was concerned; permanent characteristics race and, probably, religion may be taken into account, but transient conditions intoxication and exhaustion may not.",2
228,"The underlying idea is that citizens are expected to keep control over their behaviour, but that in circumstances where even a person of normal self-control might be provoked, the offence may be reduced from murder to manslaughter.",2
229,"The required standard of self-control is kept fairly constant, but to assess the strength of the provocation, it is necessary to consider the relevant personal  characteristics.",2
230,"This demonstrates the interaction between the excusing elements in provocation (not just the loss of self-control, but the degree of provocation experienced) and the justificatory elements (to an extent, D was right to react angrily to what had been said or done, unless the alleged provocation was self-induced or was a legally justified act).",2
231,"The interaction between these elements is a complex one, as we saw in Chapter 6.5.",2
232,"Thus, the standard of self-control is not constant but may vary, , with the age and sex of the defendant.",2
233,To modify the standard where D is very young (Camplin was 15) is understandable: it is not fair to expect a youth to show the same level of self-restraint as an adult.,2
234,The idea of having different standards for males and females has not been elaborated by the English courts.,2
235,"Clearly, sex may be a relevant characteristic in some cases, for some provocations are specific to one sex, but is there an argument for different standards of self-control for males and females?",2
236,Does the plight of battered wives who kill after a spate of ill-treatment warrant special treatment by the law?,2
237,(iii),2
238,At common law the famous case of ,2
239,(1942) held that the retaliation must bear a reasonable relationship to the provocation.,2
240,"The idea was that only an extremely grave provocation ought to mitigate a killing with a deadly weapon, whereas a lesser provocation might be allowed to mitigate other killings.",2
241,"This rule seemed to be modelled on the proportionality requirement in self-defence, and was criticized as quite unsuitable for cases of provocation, where loss of self-control intervenes between the provocation and the retaliation.",2
242,"Is it not both illogical and unreasonable to require a person who has lost self-control to ensure, , that his response is not disproportionate?",2
243,"This counter-argument has been given some recognition by the courts, the ‘reasonable relationship rule’ is a rule of law.",2
244,"But traces of it remain, since a jury must still be asked not merely whether the reasonable man would be provoked to lose self-control, but also ‘whether he would react to the provocation as the accused did’.",2
245,"The precise meaning of this formulation is unclear — does it mean ‘lose self-control and kill’, or  ‘lose self-control and kill in the way D did’— but it seems to derive from the notion that there are degrees of loss of self-control.",2
246,"If that is the underlying proposition, it is important to dissociate it from the unacceptable idea that a person's acts after loss of self-control should still be measured on an objective scale.",2
247,(iv).,2
248,"The two key questions here are: first, whether provocation ought to reduce murder to manslaughter; and, second, how wide the qualified defence should be.",2
249,"The answer to the first question is closely related to issues of stigma, labelling, and widely held opinions about culpability.",2
250,"It was argued above that it is unacceptable to claim that the mandatory penalty for murder supplies the for the qualified defence of provocation: the label ‘murder’ should be reserved for the most heinous of killings, and there is a widely held belief that provoked killings are not in this group.",2
251,"The second question, the proper ambit of the provocation defence, is more troublesome.",2
252,"It would be possible to absorb provocation into a wider notion of ‘extreme emotional disturbance’, as the American Model Penal Code does, the key to mitigation would be the extent of the defendant's psychological disturbance at the time of the killing the reasons for it.",2
253,One way of accomplishing this in English law would be to merge provocation into a widened doctrine of diminished responsibility.,2
254,"However, a central element in the common-law doctrine of provocation is the for the loss of self-control.",2
255,"If the explanation for the violent outburst lies in something which might understandably lead a person to be so angry as to lose self-control, then this supplies an added reason for mitigating the offence and the sentence.",2
256,"Thus the court must first ascertain the gravity of the provocation experienced by the defendant, and then consider whether this provides some excuse for the loss of control.",2
257,This does not gainsay the fundamental proposition that it is every citizen's duty to retain self-control — to the extent of not violating other people's interests — but it does open the way to a manslaughter verdict and to sentences which are rarely longer than eight years' imprisonment (less than half as long as the time served by many convicted of murder) and may be considerably shorter.,2
258,"However, the significant reduction in sentence is probably connected with the normative elements in the provocation doctrine, the elements of ‘partial justification’.",2
259,"In the existing law  this is shown by the requirement of reasonable self-control, and by the (probable) exclusion of conduct known to be legally justified from the category of sufficient provocation.",2
260,Surely it is the combination of the elements of partial excuse and partial justification (see Chapter 6.5 above) which raises sufficient exculpation to warrant a reduction to manslaughter.,2
261,(c) Duress as a Qualified Defence,2
262,In 1987 the House of Lords (in ) held that duress should not be available as a defence to murder.,2
263,"Their Lordships devoted little of their speeches to the possibility of allowing duress to function as a qualified defence to murder, reducing the crime to manslaughter and leaving the judge to pass an appropriate sentence.",2
264,"This would preserve the principle that a person who is threatened must be prepared to undergo heroic self-sacrifice take the life of a third party, just as the provocation doctrine preserves the principle that citizens ought always to retain self-control.",2
265,"However, the House of Lords preferred to see a conviction for murder in these cases, with the use of executive discretion to secure an early release from the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for offenders who killed when under duress, and thus appear to have reduced culpability.",2
266,"This is surely an unsatisfactory way of dealing with these cases, where the degree of emotional disturbance is likely to be no less than that involved in most provocation cases.",2
267,The normative requirements of the defence of duress (discussed in detail in Chapter 6.4) ensure that it is restricted to dire and realistic threats which a citizen of reasonable firmness could not be expected to resist.,2
268,The degree of emotional pressure on the defendant can almost be taken for granted in these cases.,2
269,"‘If murder is to be reserved for those homicides which are most deserving of stigma, this does not seem to be one of them.’",2
270,"If duress is not to be allowed as a complete defence to murder, the reduction in culpability should surely be reflected by reducing the conviction to manslaughter.",2
271,(d) Killings by the Use of Excessive Force on a Justified Occasion,2
272,"Just as it seems strange and unnecessary that the law should have to choose between duress as a complete defence to murder, and duress  as no defence , so it seems strange and unnecessary that a killing which narrowly fails to come within the requirements of self-defence or other justifiable force should then be classified as murder.",2
273,"The Australian case of (1957) involved a chicken farmer who, when he found an intruder stealing chickens, shot at him five times, killing him.",2
274,"The farmer's defence was that he intended only to wound the thief, and thought he was entitled to do so.",2
275,"In another Australian case,(1958), D was attacked by a man, in an isolated place, whom he believed was trying to force him to commit sodomy.",2
276,"D took a gun and, fearing that this stronger man would renew his attack, shot and killed him.",2
277,"In both these cases it was held that the alternative of a manslaughter verdict ought to be left to the jury where the occasion justifies action in self-defence, or to prevent a crime, or to apprehend an offender, but where the defendant acts beyond the necessity of that occasion.",2
278,Three reasons may be advanced for labelling these cases as manslaughter murder.,2
279,"First, cases of ‘excessive defence’ have a grounding in legal justification, the occasion was one which justified the use of some force, and this places them on a higher social plateau than killings with no element of justification .",2
280,"Second, the defendant has what one might term the ‘lawful motivation’, believing that the actions taken were right and proper.",2
281,"This is a subjective, motivational factor which corresponds to the objective moral distinction identified as the first reason.",2
282,"Third, in some cases the defendant acts instinctively an unexpected situation, completely misjudging the proper reactions in the heat of the moment: this is a similar reason to the second, but adds the element of emotional disturbance, which may explain the over-reaction in certain cases.",2
283,"Both the second and, more strongly, the third reason show that the doctrine of excessive defence may include a substantial element of excuse in its rationale, its theoretical foundation lies unmistakably in the concept of legal justification.",2
284,"The Australian initiative was rejected both by the Privy Council and the English courts, largely on the grounds that the common-law precedents were not compelling, that the full defence of self-defence should be applied indulgently those who use such force as they instinctively think necessary, and that the doctrine  of provocation might be used to accommodate other cases.",2
285,"The Criminal Law Revision Committee disagreed, recommending that a verdict of manslaughter should be possible where the use of some force was justified by the occasion and where D honestly believed that the force he used was reasonable in the circumstances.",2
286,"History then took a strange twist, for in ",2
287,(1987) the Australian High Court denounced the doctrine of excessive force as too complicated for juries and removed it from Australian law.,2
288,There is surely a strong social argument for regarding those who kill by using force on an occasion which justifies the use of force as less culpable than the ordinary run of murderers.,2
289,Whether this moral — social distinction should be reflected in the law by introducing a doctrine of manslaughter by excessive defence depends on the importance attached to the principle of fair labelling (see Chapter 3.3 ()).,2
290,"It is assumed here that juries and others do attach considerable importance to the label when it is a question of homicide, and therefore that the excessive use of force in self-defence is a matter which is properly reflected by a separate qualified defence, being left to sentencing (which means executive discretion, if the mandatory penalty for murder remains) or forced artificially into the doctrine of provocation (when there may be no real evidence of loss of self-control).",2
291,"The problem encountered in Australia, of the doctrine being too complicated for juries, was the result of a six-stage direction which the courts developed; surely the essence of the doctrine can be conveyed more simply than that, destroying it entirely.",2
292,(e) Manslaughter Diminished Responsibility,2
293,"Of the qualified defences to murder in English law, diminished responsibility is the most frequently used.",2
294,From 1977 to 1986 there were about half as many convictions for manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility as there were murder convictions.,2
295,"The phenomenon is a relatively recent one, since diminished responsibility was only introduced into English law in 1957, long-standing dissatisfaction with the insanity defence.",2
296,"Insanity was, and still is, a complete defence to crime, as we saw in Chapter 6.2 above, but its confines are narrow, and some persons  obviously suffering from mental disorder came to be sentenced to death for murder before 1957.",2
297,"Diminished responsibility has a wider ambit, but its effect is merely to reduce murder to manslaughter, giving the judge discretion on sentencing or other disposal.",2
298,"The wording with which section 2 of the Homicide Act 1957 introduced diminished responsibility is rather unsatisfactory, but judges, counsel, doctors, and juries have approached it with a compassionate pragmatism with the rarefied verbal analysis too frequently encountered in English criminal law.",2
299,"The mainstay of section 2 is a wide concept of ‘abnormality of mind’, interpreted in the leading case of (1960) as",2
300,a state of mind so different from that of ordinary human beings that the reasonable man would term it abnormal.,2
301,"It appears to us to be wide enough to cover the mind's activities in all its aspects, not only the perception of physical acts and matters and the ability to form a rational judgment whether an act is right or wrong, but also the ability to exercise will-power to control physical acts that rational judgment.",2
302,"Section 2 does require that the abnormality of mind should be one ‘arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury’, but this range of admissible causes is sufficiently general to encourage a broad construction of the defence.",2
303,"The court must, lastly, be satisfied that the mental abnormality ‘substantially impaired his [D's]mental responsibility’ for the killing.",2
304,"The formulation is strange, since it suggests that one can measure a person's ability to conform to the law.",2
305,"In practice, it has been taken as allowing the jury to assess whether the mental abnormality was such a significant factor in the killing as to reduce D's culpability to the extent that the offence should be reduced from murder to manslaughter.",2
306,"In most cases it is not the jury who takes this decision but the prosecution, who, with the judge's agreement, accepts the defendant's plea of guilty to manslaughter under section 2.",2
307,"Some 80 of diminished-responsibility defences are accepted by the prosecution, and only in around 13 of cases does the prosecution contest the defence evidence and thus require the jury to apply section 2.",2
308,What is the practical effect of a successful section 2 defence?,2
309,"In the three years from 1984 to 1986 there were some 229 such cases, of which almost half were dealt with by a hospital order under the  Mental Health Act 1983 (with or without restrictions).",2
310,"Ten received life imprisonment, 15 were given determinate prison sentences of between four and ten years, 10 were given prison sentences below four years, and 15 were given probation orders (with or without a condition of psychiatric treatment).",2
311,"These figures show the diversity of the cases dealt with under section 2, and they also represent a significant shift from policy in the 1960s, when around 70 of diminished-responsibility offenders were given hospital orders.",2
312,"The decline in hospital orders and the rise of prison sentences are traceable formally to the practice of modern psychiatrists of recommending fewer hospital orders, and in reality to the more restrictive policy on admission to special hospitals being pursued by the DHSS, and also to the higher proportion of defendants who are declared to have ‘recovered’ by the time of the trial.",2
313,"No hospital order will be made where the defendant is said to have recovered, and the courts often feel it necessary to impose a prison sentence in such cases.",2
314,"Delays before trial can therefore affect the result, for a defendant who is committed to hospital and recovers there would usually be released back into the community fairly swiftly.",2
315,Also receiving determinate prison sentences are those whose offence is reduced to manslaughter on a combined plea of provocation and diminished responsibility.,2
316,Among those receiving probation orders will be those for whom the section 2 defence is used to mitigate a mercy killing.,2
317,Should the qualified defence of diminished responsibility be retained?,2
318,"In answering this question, one has to contend with two muddles in English law, a general muddle about mental disorder and criminal responsibility, and a specific muddle about murder and manslaughter.",2
319,"The general muddle was discussed in Chapter 6.2(c) above: in principle, a person whose conduct was caused by mental disorder should not be liable to criminal conviction, but in practice the narrow and antiquated defence of insanity is rarely invoked in England (a handful of cases each year), and the courts normally proceed to conviction and then select a medical disposal where appropriate.",2
320,"The muddle could — and should — be cleared by introducing a workable mental-disorder defence, along the lines recommended by the Butler Committee in 1975.",2
321,If such a defence were  available in murder cases — and the consequence of a successful plea would be to give the court a limited discretion the order to be made — the case for a separate doctrine of diminished responsibility would be weak.,2
322,"The second muddle concerns murder and manslaughter specifically, namely, that since there is no workable defence of insanity, it is often assumed that the existence of the mandatory penalty for murder is the essential reason for the section 2 defence.",2
323,The Butler Committee argued that relatively minor mental disorders may be regarded as falling within section 2 simply because this outcome is thought to be preferable to mandatory life imprisonment.,2
324,"‘The medical profession is humane’, commented the Butler Committee, ‘and the evidence is often stretched.’",2
325,"That may be so, but it may be suggested that as much depends on the surrounding legal rules as on the mandatory penalty.",2
326,"If there is no workable defence of insanity, it is surely wrong to convict a grossly disordered killer of murder when the less stigmatic offence of manslaughter is at hand.",2
327,"And if the law of homicide makes no special provision for mercy killings (see Chapter 7.4(h) below) or for killings during extreme emotional disturbance, despite a widely held view that such cases ought to be treated as less culpable than ‘ordinary’ murders, is there not an argument for a fairly broadly defined qualified defence?",2
328,(f) Infanticide,2
329,"This is a separate offence from manslaughter, but it is relevant here its close links with diminished responsibility.",2
330,By the Infanticide Act 1922 Parliament mitigated the application of the law of murder to mothers who killed their new-born babies whilst suffering from the effects of childbirth.,2
331,"Doubts arose over the length of time which might elapse before the child ceased to be regarded as ‘newly born’, and the Infanticide Act 1938 extended the definition to the killing of a child within twelve months of its birth by a mother whose mind is disturbed either by reason of her not having fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to the child or the effect of lactation consequent upon the birth of the child.",2
332,"Infanticide is a defence to murder, but it is more usual to charge infanticide in the first place.",2
333,"The maximum penalty remains  life imprisonment, although almost all the cases each year (twenty or so) are dealt with non-custodially, usually by a probation order.",2
334,Three interconnected criticisms of the law may be considered here.,2
335,"first, the definition of infanticide is limited to the killing of the child most recently born, which means that when a mother in a disturbed state kills both her last-born child and another slightly older child, the one killing is infanticide and the other may be murder, whereas the defendant's culpability is surely the same in both cases.",2
336,"If the essence of infanticide lies in the effects of the stresses consequent upon recent childbirth, then it is this, and not the age of the victim, which should be the basis of the law.",2
337,"Second, the law is gender-specific, singling out women for more lenient treatment.",2
338,Some people take exception to this on the ground that it may imply that women generally have weaker characters and are less responsible for their behaviour.,2
339,"There is also the argument that the fathers of children may kill whilst overwhelmed by the stress consequent upon the arrival of a new child, and they should be not be left outside the law of infanticide.",2
340,"The third criticism is that the medical basis of the Infanticide Act 1938 is now discredited: the reference to the effect of lactation is without foundation, and it is acknowledged that the social pressures consequent upon the arrival of a new child (financial demands, unsuitable housing, effects on family relationships) may be just as likely to lead to the mental disturbance manifest in these cases as any condition linked specifically with the event of giving birth.",2
341,"In their evidence to the Criminal Law Revision Committee, the Royal College of Psychiatrists pressed for legal recognition of these wider social and situational factors.",2
342,"The Committee was equivocal on this, but recommended a formulation which would be broad enough to encompass these wider factors —‘the balance of the woman's mind was disturbed the effect of giving birth or circumstances consequent upon that birth’.",2
343,Would it not be preferable to absorb infanticide into the doctrine of diminished responsibility and allow the prosecution to charge manslaughter in such cases?,2
344,"This would have the advantage of removing both the restriction the victim and the limitation to  women, but the Criminal Law Revision Committee thought that this would lead to an effective narrowing of the scope of infanticide.",2
345,There might be cases of killings by mothers burdened by ‘social and emotional pressures’ which could not be brought within the definition of mental disorder which would be the basis of a reformed defence of diminished responsibility.,2
346,", doctors might be prepared to stretch those definitions to bring such cases within diminished responsibility, but that is an unsatisfactory basis on which to reform the law, and it provides the defendant with no legal protection against a murder verdict.",2
347,The Committee's solution was to persist with a separate offence of infanticide.,2
348,"Would it not be preferable to broaden the defence of diminished responsibility to convert it into a defence of extreme emotional disturbance, applicable to both sexes?",2
349,(g) Killing in Pursuance of a Suicide Pact,2
350,Section 4 of the Homicide Act 1957 provides that a person who kills another in pursuance of a suicide pact is guilty of manslaughter not murder.,2
351,"A suicide pact exists where two or more people, each having a settled intention of dying, reach an agreement which has as its object the death of both or all.",2
352,This may be said to amount to a mutual exercise of the individuals' rights of self-determination.,2
353,"Cases are infrequent, tending to occur in circumstances which evoke compassion condemnation.",2
354,"The Criminal Law Revision Committee recommended that killings in pursuance of a suicide pact should be a separate offence, on the ground that the stigma and maximum penalty for manslaughter are inappropriate in these cases.",2
355,"Suicide and attempted suicide ceased to be a crime when the Suicide Act 1961 became law, in recognition of the right to self-determination, but there remains an offence of aiding, abetting, counselling, or procuring the suicide of another which carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years' imprisonment.",2
356,"Many of the cases involve compassionate assistance, of the kind which may be necessary and justifiable if the right to self-determination is to have any meaning for those who are weak or bedridden (e.g. responding to a request to bring pills), but not all are like this.",2
357,"In (1977) a woman was convicted of an attempt to counsel her  mother's suicide by repeatedly encouraging her to take an overdose, and it was shown that the mother's death would greatly alleviate the defendant's financial problems.",2
358,"It is for cases of this kind, where the evidence shows that there was active persuasion compassionate assistance to someone already determined to commit suicide, that a substantial maximum penalty is thought necessary.",2
359,"For this offence and for the proposed suicide-pact offence, the Criminal Law Revision Committee (CLRC) recommended a maximum of seven years' imprisonment.",2
360,"This grading of the offences may be seen as a compromise between the compassionate elements in the offences, which are related to the right to self-determination, and the need to protect the vulnerable from persuasion on such a crucial matter as the ending of life, an argument also derived from the right to self-determination.",2
361,(h) Mercy Killing,2
362,This concept has no special significance in English criminal law.,2
363,"Where a clear case of mercy killing emerges in practice, the usual response is that ‘legal and medical consciences are stretched to bring about a verdict of manslaughter by diminished responsibility’.",2
364,"The Criminal Law Revision Committee regarded this bending of the law as unsatisfactory, and tentatively proposed a new offence of mercy killing where a person, compassion, unlawfully kills another who is, or is believed by him to be, permanently helpless or in great pain.",2
365,"The proposal attracted strong opposition, some arguing that it might withdraw legal protection from the weak and vulnerable, others arguing that the fundamental ethical problems could not be satisfactorily resolved by legal definition.",2
366,The difficulty with the counter-arguments is that the practice of ‘stretching’ diminished responsibility gives a defence to mercy killers already.,2
367,"Thus, in Dell's sample of diminished responsibility cases there were some ten cases with a mercy-killing element.",2
368,"Most of them involved ‘killings committed impulsively with whatever means were at hand’, usually by ‘men in their 60s or 70s [who]had reached breaking point under the continuing strain of looking after wives with severe mental or physical illness’.",2
369,"In some of these cases the  defendant appeared mentally normal when examined by the doctor, but the doctor was willing to infer from the circumstances that there had been abnormality of mind at the time of the killing, and to write a report which brought this within section 2.",2
370,"Practitioners seem to accept that worthy cases of mercy killing invariably have this outcome, but this informal approach provides the defendant with no legal basis for a defence — he or she is truly at the mercy of the psychiatrists, the prosecutor, and the judge.",2
371,"Thus, to return to the arguments mobilized against the CLRC's proposal: the chief difference in protection of the vulnerable between the present system and the CLRC's is that the latter had a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment, whereas life imprisonment is available where a defence of diminished responsibility succeeds; and the fundamental ethical problems are now swept under the carpet by a combination of a stretched diagnosis of ‘abnormality of mind’ and the ample judicial sentencing discretion, whereas the CLRC's proposal attempted to make the issues justiciable.",2
372,"If, however, the CLRC's proposal were altered to make mercy killing into a new qualified defence to murder, with the normal maximum sentence of life imprisonment, the central plank of the opposition to an explicit recognition of this mitigation in English law would disappear.",2
373,Beneath these arguments about legal form lie the wider issues of self-determination.,2
374,"English law might be said to recognize a right to self-determination, suicide is a crime, but that right does not yield a clear answer to the present difficulty.",2
375,The right to self-determination might realistically be extended to cover those who desire their own death but lack the resources or the strength to accomplish it: this is a strong argument for a mercy-killing defence or offence.,2
376,"Yet, recognition of that extension might at the same time open up the possibility that vulnerable people who do not desire death, despite their suffering, might be killed by others for reasons of their own: this would subvert the right to self-determination, and is an argument against a mercy-killing defence or offence.",2
377,"It seems probable that some doctors carry out mercy killings by administering large doses of pain-killing drugs which shorten life significantly, and the law may well protect them from  liability.",2
378,"However, such trust is not shown towards relatives and friends who assist suffering people in this way: they must run the gauntlet of a legal process which accords no formal recognition to the circumstances under which they killed.",2
379,(i) Conclusion: the Murder-Manslaughter Boundary,2
380,"The basic legal distinction between murder and manslaughter lies in the mental element, but English law has now developed qualified defences to murder which mark out cases where, despite the presence of the mental element for murder, culpability is thought to be sufficiently reduced to warrant a reduction in the class of offence.",2
381,"Our discussion has taken a broad view of qualified defences, commenting also on some qualified defences which might be recognized but which do not feature in contemporary English law.",2
382,Various reasons have been advanced for recognizing qualified defences to murder.,2
383,"Some regard the mandatory penalty for murder as the chief, even the sole, reason for these doctrines.",2
384,It has been suggested here that the mandatory penalty is relevant but not critical.,2
385,"The key issues are, on the one hand, the proper legal classification of an offence which contains some exculpatory features, and, on the other, the distribution of decision-making power between the judge, the jury, and the executive.",2
386,"The label ‘murder’, and the stigma thought to accompany it, should be reserved for the most heinous group of killings; there is a well-recognized offence of manslaughter beneath murder, and this should be used for offences where the culpability is significantly lower.",2
387,"The mandatory penalty of life imprisonment for murder makes issues of relative culpability non-justiciable , since the length of imprisonment is ‘determined or partly determined behind the scenes by someone who has not heard any representations by or the prisoner on grounds which the prisoner does not know’.",2
388,"If, on the other hand, Lord Kilbrandon's suggestion of a single offence of unlawful homicide were adopted, the crucial questions of culpability would be decided solely at the sentencing stage by the judge.",2
389,The jury would have no role in this; the judge would derive no assistance from their verdict.,2
390,"What, then, should be the proper division of functions between judge and jury in homicide cases?",2
391,The arguments some  seven qualified defences have been considered above.,2
392,"Since it is possible that one defence might be raised in each case, sometimes in combination with a defence of lack of intent, a system of criminal law which offers seven qualified defences to murder risks undue complication and confusion in contested cases.",2
393,"The merit of separate qualified defences is that they focus the evidence and the legal argument, giving the jury (in contested cases) an opportunity to assess the defence, and giving the judge fairly precise guidance on the basis for sentencing: this might be thought to ensure that each defendant is dealt with more fairly, but the risk of confusing the jury in a contested case might tend to erode that protection.",2
394,One approach would be to consider amalgamating some of the defences.,2
395,"This is not to condone ‘stretching’ defences, using diminished responsibility to cover mercy killing, , or provocation to cover excessive defence, but rather to examine whether the defences have common rationales which can be drawn together.",2
396,"Three of the qualified defences discussed above have an element of justification — provocation, excessive defence, and some cases of duress.",2
397,"Most of the qualified defences have an element of excuse — provocation, diminished responsibility, most duress cases, infanticide, mercy killing, and suicide pacts.",2
398,"One possibility would be to evolve a qualified defence of killing under extreme emotional disturbance, following the lead of the Model Penal Code.",2
399,This might encompass all those qualified defences with an element of excuse in them.,2
400,"A provoked loss of self-control could fall within this new doctrine — as, indeed, could losses of self-control stemming from non-human sources a natural disaster or financial ruin.",2
401,"Diminished responsibility could also be accommodated, although a general defence of mental disorder remains a better way of labelling and dealing with cases of clinical mental disorder.",2
402,"Cases now treated as infanticide often involve extreme emotional disturbance, as do mercy killings, suicide pacts, and cases of duress.",2
403,"One advantage of this amalgamation might be that there would be less potential for the jury to become confused, and yet the jury would still be empowered to reduce murder to manslaughter in appropriate cases.",2
404,"One disadvantage of the change might be that the more precise moral distinctions currently incorporated within the law would become submerged within the sentencing discretion, where the signposts are less clear and the arguments less structured.",2
405,"This might be the case with provocation, : there may be objections to some of the distinctions now drawn by the law of  provocation, but a broader defence of extreme emotional disturbance might provide for reduction of the offence in cases of loss of self-control when caring for a baby or when arrested by a police-officer known to be acting lawfully, and some might feel that there are strong arguments against this.",2
406,"However, such disadvantages could be minimized by elaborating the definition of extreme emotional disturbance to clarify its extent and its limitations, and by evolving sentencing guidelines which set out the major determinants of culpability.",2
407,This would attribute some weight to the principle of maximum certainty (see Chapter 3.3(i)) in this important area of the law.,2
408,"Yet there would undoubtedly remain a considerable amount of discretion, both for judges and juries applying the law, if the words ‘sufficient to reduce the offence from murder to manslaughter’ were retained, and at the sentencing stage, the particular combination of factors in each case.",2
409,"Such a reformulated qualified defence would not encompass cases of excessive self-defence, since they may involve a genuine and unhurried misjudgment of the amount of force permissible, and so they would have to be the subject of a separate qualified defence.",2
410,"But the question remains whether, in practice and in theory, it would not be fairer to retain several separate qualified defences which labelled the circumstances of each mitigated killing more accurately.",2
411,7.5 ‘INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER’,2
412,"The category of killings which has come to be known as involuntary manslaughter has nothing to do with involuntariness, properly .",2
413,These are not cases where the accused has caused death while in an involuntary state.,2
414,"These are cases where death has been caused with insufficient fault to justify labelling it as murder, but with sufficient fault for a manslaughter verdict.",2
415,"The word ‘involuntary’ is therefore used merely to distinguish these killings from ones which have the necessary intent for murder but which are reduced to manslaughter by one of the doctrines just considered, provocation or diminished responsibility.",2
416,The legal debate in involuntary manslaughter is over the lower threshold of homicide liability — where to draw the line between manslaughter and killings which should be ascribed to mere accident.,2
417,"There is, however, a large variety of killings which lie above that line but  below the line demarcating murder: a killing in which D knew there was a risk of death, but was held not to have intended death or grievous bodily harm, would fall within involuntary manslaughter and might justify a high sentence; whereas a killing in which D pushed a person during an argument in the street and the person fell backwards, cracking his head on the kerb and dying from a brain haemorrhage, might also fall within involuntary manslaughter and might justify a low sentence.",2
418,"The offence, as now defined in English law, covers a wide spectrum of culpability.",2
419,Beneath the law of involuntary manslaughter lie some deep issues of general principle.,2
420,", the offence includes a species of constructive liability, which was criticized in Chapter 5.2(b).",2
421,"Can this be justified by reference to the magnitude of the harm resulting, i.e. death?",2
422,"Or would it be fairer to convict the harm-doer of a lesser offence, thus ignoring the chance result?",2
423,"Another problem is the more general one of liability for negligence: as we saw in Chapter 5.3 (), this is regarded as insufficient for liability for most serious offences, and yet it may be sufficient for manslaughter.",2
424,"Is it right that liability for the second most heinous crime in English law, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, should be satisfied by this relatively low grade of fault?",2
425,These questions will be discussed in more detail once the elements of the offence have been outlined.,2
426,(a) Manslaughter by an Unlawful and Dangerous Act,2
427,This species of involuntary manslaughter is based upon constructive liability.,2
428,"In broad terms, the law constructs liability the lesser crime which D was committing, and which happened to cause death.",2
429,"In fact, the courts have progressively narrowed this species of manslaughter over the last century or so: there was a time when the mere commission of a tort or civil wrong sufficed as the ‘unlawful act’, and when there was no additional requirement of ‘dangerousness’ to be satisfied.",2
430,"What the prosecution must now prove is that D was committing a crime (not being a crime of negligence or a crime of omission), that in committing this crime he caused V's death, and that what he did when committing this crime was objectively dangerous.",2
431,Let us examine each of these requirements in turn.,2
432,"First, D must have been committing a crime.",2
433,"In many cases the crime which constitutes the ‘unlawful act’ will be a battery or an  assault occasioning actual bodily harm, arising from a push, a punch, or a kick.",2
434,"The prosecution must establish that all the elements of the crime relied upon as the unlawful act were present, and this includes the mental elements of intent or recklessness in assault or battery.",2
435,"To that extent there may be said to be a mental element required for this variety of manslaughter, but it is a manifestly low mental element compared with the death which results.",2
436,"If the unlawful act is arson (criminal damage by fire), the fault element will be intention or recklessness, and the latter does not require any subjective awareness on the defendant's part.",2
437,"Where D was intoxicated when committing the ‘unlawful act’, it is likely that he would be liable to conviction for that offence despite his intoxicated state.",2
438,"If so, the offence is sufficient to fulfil the ‘unlawful act’ requirement for manslaughter.",2
439,There are two types of crime which will not suffice as the unlawful act: crimes of negligence and crimes of omission.,2
440,The reasons for excluding crimes of omission are examined in section 7.5(d) below.,2
441,The reasons for excluding crimes of negligence were stated in.,2
442,The reasons for excluding crimes of negligence were stated in.,2
443,"(1937), where a driver had killed a pedestrian whilst overtaking another car.",2
444,"There was little dispute that D had committed the offence of dangerous driving, but did that automatically make him guilty of manslaughter when death resulted?",2
445,"The House of Lords held that it did not: since the essence of dangerous driving was negligence, a driver should only be convicted of manslaughter if his driving was so bad as to amount to the gross negligence required under the third head of involuntary manslaughter (see below).",2
446,"the decision was motivated by tenderness towards motorists is hard to tell, but there was certainly some logic in keeping offences of negligence the ‘unlawful act’ doctrine when a separate head of manslaughter by gross negligence already existed.",2
447,"Once it has been established that D was committing a criminal offence, the second step is to establish that this caused the death.",2
448,"In most cases of battery or actual bodily harm the causal connection will be plain, but cases involving drugs have presented difficulties.",2
449,"In (1976) the Court of Appeal was prepared to hold that the offence of possessing controlled drugs was sufficient, together with the act of injecting another with these drugs, it is difficult to see how mere possession (which is the offence) can cause  death.",2
450,"In (1982) the unlawful act was the supplying of controlled drugs to V, who then took them.",2
451,"The Court of Appeal held that the supplying was insufficient as an unlawful act because it was not ‘directed at’ V. Subsequent decisions are unclear whether the ‘directed at’test remains good law, and a better approach to the facts of would be to hold that the supplying of drugs did not cause the death because V took them himself.",2
452,The third requirement is that the defendant's conduct in committing the crime must have been objectively dangerous.,2
453,"This was seen as a slight restriction of the doctrine when it was imposed in (1966), where the court held that ‘The unlawful act must be all sober and reasonable people would inevitably recognize must subject the other person to, , the risk of some harm resulting therefrom, albeit not serious harm.’",2
454,"The House of Lords has declined to narrow this requirement by demanding that D recognized the risk, and it has also been held that the dangerousness should be judged on the actual circumstances, ignoring D's mistaken belief about the facts.",2
455,"The test therefore appears to be broad and readily fulfilled, but the phrase ‘some harm…albeit not serious harm’ has been construed restrictively in one sense.",2
456,"In (1985) D, wearing a mask and carrying a pickaxe handle, approached a petrol-station attendant and demanded money; D fled when the attendant pressed the alarm bell, but the attendant then suffered a heart attack and died.",2
457,"The Court of Appeal held that the unlawful act would only be regarded as ‘dangerous’ if it was likely to cause physical harm, not if mere emotional shock (unaccompanied by physical harm) was foreseeable.",2
458,(b) Manslaughter by Recklessness,2
459,The most recent development in the law of involuntary manslaughter is the doctrine of manslaughter by recklessness.,2
460,"Although the word ‘reckless’ had been used many times before in the context of manslaughter, a distinctive doctrine was established in (1983).",2
461,"4 After an argument with the woman with whom he had been living, D drove his lorry into her car and crushed her to death.",2
462,"The House of Lords held that this was manslaughter if there was an obvious and serious risk of causing physical injury to some other person, and D had either failed to give any thought to this risk or, having recognised the risk, nonetheless went on to take it.",2
463,"It will be seen that this is the formula for recklessness (analysed in Chapter 5.3 ()), and is virtually the same as the test for the separate offence of causing death by reckless driving.",2
464,"The House of Lords accepted that the definitions of the two offences are the same, merely adding that the prosecutor should charge manslaughter when the maximum penalty for the offence of causing death by reckless driving (five years) might be insufficient.",2
465,"In the House of Lords seemed to be principally concerned with manslaughter committed with a motor vehicle, but subsequent cases establish that the test of ‘obvious and serious risk of physical injury to some person’ is applicable to offences using different methods, fire.",2
466,(c) Manslaughter by Gross Negligence,2
467,"Although the authorities conflict, it has been laid down that the new doctrine of reckless manslaughter supersedes the older doctrine of manslaughter by gross negligence.",2
468,"Many of the old cases could indeed be subsumed within the new doctrine, but it does not cover them all.",2
469,"In the case of (1974), where an attendant at a mental hospital caused the death of a patient by releasing a flow of boiling water into a bath, the test was whether he was grossly negligent.",2
470,"In (1925), where a doctor had attended the confinement of a woman who died whilst giving birth, the Court of Criminal Appeal held that there must be negligence over and above that which is sufficient to establish civil liability, and which shows ‘such disregard for the life and safety of others’ deserve punishment.",2
471,"Both these cases might be decided similarly on the test, but that cannot be said of (1967).",2
472,"Here two young men were joking with a gun; D pointed it at V and pulled the trigger, believing that it would not fire because neither bullet was opposite the barrel.",2
473,"The gun was a revolver, however, and it did  fire, killing V. The Court of Appeal held that D might properly be convicted if his belief that there was no danger of the gun firing was formed in a criminally negligent way.",2
474,"However, under the test derived from , a person is not reckless if he thinks about the possible risk but decides that it does not obtain.",2
475,"This is the gap, and is a case which might have fallen into it.",2
476,"It therefore follows that, if the courts have indeed replaced manslaughter by gross negligence with manslaughter by recklessness, they have narrowed the law slightly.",2
477,"It is more likely, however, that manslaughter by gross negligence remains reckless manslaughter.",2
478,(c) Manslaughter by Omission,2
479,"The courts have been reluctant to bring omissions cases within the above categories, manifesting their belief in the separate moral and legal status of omissions.",2
480,"This was not always so: in (1899) a man who belonged to a religious sect called the Peculiar People refused to call a doctor to his child, who subsequently died; he was held guilty of manslaughter on the ground that he had committed an unlawful act (wilful neglect of the child) which caused death.",2
481,"However, this very reasoning was abjured in (1973), where D failed to ensure that medical help was summoned to his child, and it died.",2
482,The Court of Appeal held that a manslaughter verdict would not necessarily follow from a conviction for wilful neglect:,2
483,if I strike a child in a manner likely to cause harm it is right that if the child dies I may be charged with manslaughter.,2
484,"If, however, I omit to do something with the result that it suffers injury to health which results in death, we think that a charge of manslaughter should not be an inevitable consequence, the omission is deliberate.",2
485,"This passage suggests that the law should, and does, draw a distinction between the blameworthiness of acts and omissions, even where the omission is deliberate.",2
486,And yet the connection between withholding medical aid and subsequent death is surely closer than that between striking a child once and subsequent death.,2
487,The father's duty in and in is manifest and incontrovertible.,2
488,"If the ‘unlawful act’ doctrine is thought sound, these cases should fall squarely within it.",2
489,"If the doctrine is thought unsound, both the omissions  cases and the act cases should be taken it.",2
490,A distinction between them is morally untenable.,2
491,Omissions cases falling within manslaughter by recklessness or gross negligence have also been set cases of positive acts.,2
492,"The leading modern case is (1977), where two people were convicted of manslaughter for allowing a sick relative, whom they had permitted to live in their house, to die without medical attention.",2
493,The Court of Appeal's grounds for finding a duty of care in this case are scrutinized elsewhere.,2
494,"Once the duty is established, the fault element required was expressed as recklessness, and defined thus: ‘a reckless disregard of danger to the health and welfare of the infirm person.",2
495,Mere inadvertence is not enough.,2
496,"The defendant must be proved to have been indifferent to an obvious risk of injury to health, or actually to have foreseen the risk but to have determined nevertheless to run it.’",2
497,"This passage is rendered ambiguous by the use of the word ‘indifferent’: if that connotes failure to realize an obvious risk, the test is similar to but probably inconsistent with the earlier assertion that ‘mere inadvertence is not enough’.",2
498,"If the test of recklessness does indeed apply, then this form of omissions liability could be assimilated within the general doctrine of manslaughter by recklessness.",2
499,"The only difference would be that required an obvious risk of physical injury to another, whereas required a risk of injury to health, and the difference may be more apparent than real.",2
500,(e) The Contours of Manslaughter,2
501,The English law of manslaughter exhibits a tension between various principles of fairness to the defendant and the significance of the harm caused.,2
502,"It is the resulting harm (death) which still dominates, as is evident from the fact that many forms of conduct fall within the law of manslaughter if death happens to result, whereas they would not even amount to a serious offence if a consequence less than death had ensued.",2
503,"Thus ‘unlawful act’ manslaughter, which can be committed by virtue of a mere assault or battery, is an example of constructive liability (see Chapter 5.2 (a) and (b)); it is only luck which makes the difference between the summary offence of common assault (maximum, six months' imprisonment) and the grave  offence of manslaughter (maximum, life imprisonment).",2
504,"‘Reckless’ manslaughter is also an example of constructive liability; recklessness is justifiable as a standard, it is only an obvious risk of injury which must have been foreseeable.",2
505,Can these derogations from principle be justified?,2
506,"Reasons can only be found in the unique significance of human life and in the need to mark out, and to prevent, conduct which causes its loss.",2
507,"In considering whether these reasons are strong enough, we should not neglect the fact that some offences of manslaughter lie well above the lower boundaries of liability and fall little short of murder.",2
508,"There is no doubting the substantial culpability of the person who embarks on a course of conduct knowing that there is a risk of death to another (e.g. the man who administered chloroform in ), and the person who foresees the risk of really serious harm to another from the course of conduct being pursued.",2
509,"The offence of murder is restricted to intent, and it would seem natural that recklessness the same consequences should amount to the lesser offence of manslaughter.",2
510,"The Criminal Law Revision Committee, which found much of the English law of manslaughter unsupportable, argued that there is a need for a homicide offence beneath murder to encompass those who cause death when reckless death or serious injury.",2
511,"But what about the lower threshold of manslaughter, where its minimum requirements form the boundary with accidental (non-criminal) homicide?",2
512,"Surely, to apply the label ‘manslaughter’ to the conduct of a person who envisaged no more than a common assault, e. g. by a single punch, is both disproportionate and unfair.",2
513,It grossly exaggerates the amount of subjective culpability.,2
514,"And, viewed objectively, the risk of death from a single punch is far too remote to enter into one's reasonable contemplation.",2
515,The present law attributes too much weight to chance: ‘the offender's fault falls too far short of the unlucky result.,2
516,So serious an offence as manslaughter should not be a lottery.’,2
517,To support manslaughter liability in these cases one would have to espouse the draconian principle that a person should be held liable for all the consequences of any wrongful act.,2
518,"A refusal to espouse that principle is perhaps the only ground on which the omissions cases (see 7.5(d) above) can be defended, since their  distinction between acts and omissions is unconvincing.",2
519,"Different considerations press forward, however, when we move on to the various situations in which known risks ought to be guarded against: bad driving of a motor vehicle may carry an obvious risk of causing death or serious injury, as may bad navigation of a ship or an aircraft, bad driving of a train, setting fire to a residential building, and the handling of firearms.",2
520,"These risks are widely known, distinguished as much by the possibility of one or several deaths occurring as by the frequency with which the risk materializes.",2
521,"Those who deal with firearms are generally aware of the attendant risks, and the days when those involved in motoring and other forms of transport could make light of the risks to life have now long passed, as various air, sea, rail, and road disasters have occurred.",2
522,"In spheres of conduct these, where the risks are widely known, there are strong reasons for broadening the basis of criminal liability to encompass negligence.",2
523,"This still falls well short of supporting the English law of manslaughter, where the ‘unlawful act’ doctrine allows a manslaughter conviction if death results from a mere assault or battery.",2
524,It also fails to substantiate the claim that death-causing acts or omissions in these situations of known danger should fall within the law of manslaughter some other offence.,2
525,Thus it remains for discussion whether it would not be preferable to criminalize them special ‘endangerment’ offences.,2
526,"One advantage of that approach would be to direct attention to the particular source of danger, thus labelling the offence in a way which both describes the circumstances of the offence and serves an educative or even deterrent purpose.",2
527,"A possible disadvantage is that, since such offences may lack the stigma of the word ‘manslaughter’, they may tend to underplay the gravity of the behaviour involved.",2
528,"On the other hand, the social significance of the offences is likely to be set as much by prosecution policy and sentencing policy as by the label of the offence.",2
529,"These tensions behind the law of manslaughter are evident in the decisions of the courts during this century, many of which have narrowed the offence, but some of which have extended it.",2
530,"However, only the legislature can create new offences of endangerment.",2
531,What progress has it made towards this?,2
532,7.6 ENDANGERMENT ON THE ROADS,2
533,English law contains a number of offences which penalize the driving of a car on a road in a manner which may cause harm.,2
534,"There is the offence of driving recklessly (section 2 of the Road Traffic Act 1972), and there are also the lesser offences of driving without due care and attention, and driving without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road (section 3 of the 1972 Act).",2
535,"Clearly, the difference between reckless driving and careless driving is one of degree.",2
536,"In the leading case of (1981) it was held that reckless driving consists of driving which creates an obvious and serious risk of causing physical injury to some other person who might be happening to use the road or of doing substantial damage to property, and that the fault element is that the driver either failed to give any thought to the possibility of such a risk or, having recognized the existence of a risk, went on to take it.",2
537,"Many of the cases falling within this offence may involve serious fault — where there is racing on the highway, , or a prolonged course of very bad driving, or bad driving to avoid apprehension.",2
538,"Some less culpable forms of bad driving might also be labelled ‘reckless’, a momentary dozing-off at the wheel, or the failure to notice a pedestrian on a crossing.",2
539,"these two offences, there is a homicide offence of causing death by reckless driving (section 1 of the 1972 Act).",2
540,"The elements of the offence are exactly the same as for reckless driving, with the extra element of causing death.",2
541,"It will readily be noticed that the elements of causing death by reckless driving are virtually the same as those of ‘reckless manslaughter’: indeed, in (1983) the House of Lords held that they are the same, and the only doubt arises over the reference to ‘substantial damage to property’ in the test.",2
542,"An obvious risk of property damage alone is insufficient for manslaughter, but may suffice for the driving offences.",2
543,"The driving offence of ‘causing death’ was first introduced in 1956, largely because juries were unwilling to convict culpable motorists of such a serious-sounding offence as manslaughter.",2
544,"The  position now seems to be that the two offences have the same legal definition, and that the prosecution should prefer the charge of manslaughter when the case is a bad one which might merit a sentence the five-year maximum for causing death by reckless driving.",2
545,"Ever since the offence of causing death by reckless driving was introduced (it formerly included causing death by dangerous driving, too), there have been those who have pointed to its ‘illogicality’.",2
546,The difference between an offence of reckless driving (maximum penalty of two years) and one of causing death by reckless driving (maximum penalty of five years) may simply be one of chance.,2
547,"Bad driving may or may not lead to an accident, the chance conjunction of other factors and other people's behaviour.",2
548,And an accident may lead to death (in which case the more serious offence is committed) or merely to serious injuries or to minor damage.,2
549,"The response to this ‘illogicality’— which is, , the very problem with the law of involuntary manslaughter too — has varied in recent English proposals.",2
550,"Both the James Committee in 1976 and the Criminal Law Revision Committee in 1980 recommended the abolition of the offence of causing death by reckless driving, thereby accepting the ‘illogicality’ argument.",2
551,This accords with the CLRC's proposal that both ‘unlawful act’ manslaughter and reckless manslaughter should be abolished.,2
552,"However, the report of the Road Traffic Law Review has reversed this trend.",2
553,"The Review accepts the general principle that persons should be judged the intrinsic quality of their driving its consequences, but argues that the law should depart from this in cases where death is caused and the driver's culpability is already high.",2
554,This is a frank recognition of the tension created by cases where there is the supreme harm (death) combined with some culpability but no foresight of the risk of death.,2
555,"There is a well-known risk in motoring that certain kinds of driving may cause accidents, and that accidents may cause death.",2
556,"The rules of the road are designed not only to produce the orderly and unhampered movement of traffic, but also to protect property, safety, and lives.",2
557,One who deviates so manifestly from these rules drive recklessly  ought to realize — because the driving test requires a driver to realize — that there is a considerable risk of an accident.,2
558,"If an accident happens as a result of driving which deviates from the proper standard, then that may well be a case of negligence the driver had never thought of the risk in that particular case, because the driver is presumed to know the Highway Code.",2
559,It is this negligence which is termed ‘recklessness’ by the decisions in and .,2
560,"There is, however, another dimension to the debate, and this appears from the CLRC's view that, where reckless driving causes death, this should not affect the label of the offence but may be treated as an aggravating factor in sentencing in appropriate cases.",2
561,"This assumes that there is a tension between the causing of serious harm (death) and the relatively low fault (‘recklessness’, as here defined), and that this tension should be resolved the fault element when we are deciding on the labels of offences, thereby making no reference to the result, but should be resolved the serious harm when sentencing, increasing the sentence the gravity of the resulting harm.",2
562,", we should call the offence reckless driving, but the occurrence of death, it may be regarded as bad luck, should aggravate the sentence.",2
563,Is it defensible to have different principles for sentencing and for the labelling of offences?,2
564,"Much depends on the social function of labelling criminal offences, and on the particular labels chosen.",2
565,"We are referring here to the offence of causing death by reckless driving, not to manslaughter.",2
566,"It is therefore, one may assume, a label of intermediate stigma (falling short of the stigma attached to the offence of manslaughter).",2
567,"The fault element is fairly substantial, since the definition refers to an obvious and serious risk of substantial damage to property: there will be few cases where only such damage, and no risk to personal safety, is involved; moreover, as argued above, a major reason for having rules of the road which all drivers should know is to reduce the risk of injuries and deaths resulting.",2
568,"Retaining the more serious label which refers to the causing of death may therefore perform a useful educative function; it is hardly unfair to the driver, since this is the very risk against which the rules are intended to guard.",2
569,"sentencing, English courts have been unclear about the proper approach.",2
570,"In (1984), a case of  careless driving where a death resulted, the Court of Appeal held that the proper basis for sentence is ‘the quality of driving, the extent to which the appellant on the particular occasion fell below the standard of the reasonably competent driver’, to which ‘the unforeseen and unexpected results of the carelessness’ are not relevant.",2
571,"However, there are other decisions which have taken account of unexpected and chance results as aggravating factors.",2
572,"The problem, surely, is to find a satisfactory starting-point for the level of sentences.",2
573,"The degree of risk created by the bad driving should be regarded as the crucial factor; it is not so much a question of whether the sentence should be more severe when the risk eventuates, as whether the sentence should be more lenient when the risk does not materialize.",2
574,"If the aim of the rules of the road is to protect safety, and if the driver broke those rules in a way which may be labelled ‘reckless’, then the risk has been taken and the sentence should not be affected significantly by the materialization or non-materialization of the risk.",2
575,"But, as a risk to safety taken recklessly, the offence deserves a penalty which places it above many intentional offences against property.",2
576,"The argument, then, is that the causing of death by bad driving should not be regarded as a significant aggravating factor, but nor should the non-causing of death or injury be regarded as a significant mitigating factor.",2
577,"The level of sentence should be set primarily, as the Lord Chief Justice stated in , ‘the degree of carelessness and culpability’.",2
578,"It will therefore be seen that many of the issues involved here are similar to those raised by the law of involuntary manslaughter, the fact that driving offences constitute deviations from a code of conduct on which all persons are tested before they are granted driving-licences.",2
579,"This factor serves to distinguish driving cases from those of deaths resulting from a single punch, and also to bolster the argument that the penalties for the former should be higher than for the latter.",2
580,7.7 ENDANGERMENT IN OTHER SITUATIONS,2
581,"Our discussion so far has stressed the relationship between endangerment on the roads and the detailed rules of the road, including the driving test.",2
582,"Some preventive rules, together with  endangerment offences, can be seen in a variety of other situations, but nowhere is there such a detailed and fairly widely known set of standards as that applicable to drivers on the roads.",2
583,", there are regulations about the storage of explosives, and the dangers of handling explosives are well known.",2
584,"The main thrust of the Explosives Act 1883, however, is contained in the offences of causing an explosion likely to endanger life (section 2), and the possession of explosives with intent to endanger life (section 3).",2
585,"The latter offence is an inchoate offence of a familiar kind: possession with intent, in circumstances where an innocent reason for possessing explosives is fairly hard to come by (unless the defendant is engaged in quarrying or another business in which explosives are used).",2
586,"The justification for the possession offence is preventive, and there is little difficulty in holding that a person caught explosives with intent to endanger life has sufficiently crossed the threshold of criminality to justify punishment.",2
587,"True, there may yet be the possibility of repentance as the time for using the explosives draws near, but the very step of taking explosives into one's Possession with this intent is culpable.",2
588,"the endangerment offence itself, two features in section 2 of the 1883 Act stand out.",2
589,"One is that no actual endangerment is required: the explosion need only have been inherently likely to endanger life, and the offence is committed anyone's life was put in danger.",2
590,"In its style of labelling, therefore, this differs from the present driving law, with its separate offences of reckless driving and causing death by reckless driving: the equivalent would be a single offence of driving in a manner likely to endanger life.",2
591,The second feature of the offence of causing an explosion likely to endanger life is that there appears to be no distinct fault requirement.,2
592,"the prosecution proves that D caused the explosion, and that the explosion was likely to endanger life, that would suffice for conviction.",2
593,"The reason for this must be that one can hardly cause an explosion without realizing that one is about to do so, and that explosions usually create danger and must be known to do so, unless they are carefully controlled in an area members of the public.",2
594,"However, these arguments are not particularly strong, for, if the inference of fault is so great, why not include a requirement of proof of fault, at the level of subjective recklessness?",2
595,Further offences of endangerment may be found in the Firearms  Act 1968.,2
596,"Section 16 contains an offence of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life, which corresponds to the offence under section 3 of the Explosives Act.",2
597,"Again, the circumstances of the possession are likely to raise an inference of intent, unless the possession was clearly connected with some authorised shooting activity.",2
598,There are then three possession offences of a slightly different type.,2
599,"Section 18 penalizes the possession of a firearm with intent to commit a crime or to resist arrest: this is a more specific variation of section 16, catering for the defence that the firearm was being carried for use in a robbery but with no intention that it would actually be used to endanger anyone, only to frighten — that would be a section 18 offence.",2
600,"Section 19 penalises possession of a loaded firearm in a public place, presumably in circumstances where the section 16 offence cannot be proved, but on the argument that the mere possession is sufficiently dangerous because accidents can happen with loaded guns, and the consequences might be life-endangering.",2
601,"Section 20 penalizes possession of a firearm when trespassing: again, there might be a defence to a section 16 charge if D was merely intending to shoot animals or fowl, but the gun could be turned on a human being and therefore represents a source of danger.",2
602,What these firearms offences appear to amount to is a criminalization of the carrying of firearms in all but the most innocent of contexts.,2
603,"If the firearm is discharged and property is damaged, then an offence of criminal damage may be charged.",2
604,"If it is discharged and a person is injured or killed, the appropriate offence against the person can be charged.",2
605,What the Firearms Act provides is a series of inchoate or preventive offences which criminalize conduct even before it has reached the stage of an attempt to commit some substantive offence.,2
606,"The offences do not require any endangerment : that is taken to be inherent in the carrying of firearms, since their potentialities are grave and the risk of accidents deliberate use is well known.",2
607,"Offences relating to the operation of aircraft, ships, and railways have not been prominent in the practice of English criminal law.",2
608,"But the law does contain such offences, and it is more a matter of prosecutors making little use of them.",2
609,"It is true that over the years a few railway signalmen have been convicted of manslaughter for wrongful acts and omissions leading to fatal train crashes, but there is not the natural resort to the criminal law which is now a feature of road-traffic cases.",2
610,"In a sense, greater values are at stake in the operation of aircraft, ships, and railways, because many lives are  involved, more than would normally be risked by the bad driving of a motor vehicle (although there is an important exception here in the operation of buses and coaches, which are more akin to planes, boats, and trains).",2
611,"But there is another significant difference between the individual driving a car or a lorry and all these other forms of transport, and that is the chain of responsibility.",2
612,"A company's management policies might be just as much to blame for a particular ‘accident’ as the actions of the driver, pilot, or captain: Sheen J made this point in his report on the Zeebrugge ferry disaster, but English prosecution practice has tended not to invoke the criminal law against managers of transport systems.",2
613,"One reason for this may be the doctrine of corporate liability in English criminal law (discussed in Chapter 4.3, and found to be unsatisfactory); , it may be difficult to establish the fault necessary for manslaughter, although easier to secure a conviction under legislation on railways or merchant shipping.",2
614,"There may also be a reluctance among prosecutors to look beyond the individual driver, pilot, or captain in each case.",2
615,It is not just the operation of systems of transport which is a source of endangerment: the actions of individuals may be designed to take advantage of the possibility of causing several deaths .,2
616,"The longest determinate prison sentence ever upheld by English courts was the sentence of forty-five years' imprisonment in the case of (1988), a man who sent his pregnant girlfriend on a flight with a bag which contained a bomb timed to destroy the aircraft and its 350 passengers in mid-flight.",2
617,"The offence in this was ‘an attempt to place on an aircraft a device likely to destroy or damage the aircraft, the Aviation Security Act 1982’— an inchoate offence, and one worded without any express reference to the endangerment of lives.",2
618,"The sentence, however, was intended to reflect the attempt to kill so many people.",2
619,"Injuries and deaths at work are a significant and reducible source of danger to the citizen, and the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 provides the framework for the regulation of safety in work-places with an offence of failing to ensure that, ‘so far as is reasonably practicable’, employees are not exposed to risks to their health or safety.",2
620,"Other fragmentary legislation is to be found in recent years, e.g. the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.",2
621,"However, all these specific offences of endangerment, English law does contain one fairly wide-ranging offence, and that is the aggravated offence of criminal damage.",2
622,Under section 1(2) of the Criminal Damage Act 1971 it is an offence — punishable with life imprisonment — to damage property ‘intending by the destruction or damage to endanger the life of another or being reckless whether the life of another would be thereby endangered’.,2
623,"Criminal damage itself is an offence carrying ten years' imprisonment, but this is a more serious offence — more of an offence against the person.",2
624,One might well ask how important the element of criminal damage is to the rationale of the aggravated offence.,2
625,"One answer could be that, where the damage is caused by fire, the consequent danger to life may be similar to that created by an explosion, and the inferences may be the same: who could cause such a fire in such a place without appreciating the danger to others?",2
626,"However, the major question raised by section I(2) of the Criminal Damage Act is why English law does not have a general offence of endangerment.",2
627,"Why should the fact that D was engaged on causing damage to property at the time (even damage to D's own property) make his conduct into an offence punishable with life imprisonment when, if D were engaged on some other activity, it would not be punishable as such and would only amount to manslaughter if a death happened to be caused?",2
628,"Section 211.2 of the Model Penal Code has been enacted into the laws of many American states, providing a general endangerment offence.",2
629,The offence is committed where a person recklessly engages in conduct which places another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury.,2
630,"It does not require any result, although it does require actual danger.",2
631,"Its great merit is that it is not confined to particular activities, and therefore has an across-the-board application to different sources of endangerment.",2
632,"On the other hand, such a general offence does not fulfil the educative function of singling out situations which carry a particular risk of danger.",2
633,"For that reason, it would be wise to retain a special offence for road-traffic cases, and there may be merit in retaining offences with particular labels in other spheres.",2
634,What is more pertinent is whether the different styles of the offences discussed above have some justification.,2
635,"Should the fault standard require D's actual awareness, or merely an objective probability of danger?",2
636,"Should there be proof of actual danger to someone, or is potential danger enough?",2
637,NON-FATAL VIOLATIONS OF THE PERSON,2
638,8.1 VARIETIES OF PHYSICAL VIOLATION,2
639,"In this chapter we shall be discussing two main forms of physical violation: the use of physical force, and sexual assaults.",2
640,"It is quite obvious that each type of violence varies considerably in its degree: physical force can be anything from a mere push to a brutal beating which leaves the victim close to death, and a sexual assault may be anything from a brief touching to a gross form of sexual violation.",2
641,"One problem which the criminal law has to confront, therefore, when dealing with physical violation, is how to grade the seriousness of the conduct.",2
642,The variations are so wide that it would contravene both the principle of fair labelling (see Chapter 3.3 (1)) and the principle of maximum certainty (see Chapter 3.3 (i)) if there were just a single offence of non-fatal harm and a single offence of sexual assault: this would often leave little to be decided at the trial and would transfer the effective decision to the sentencing stage.,2
643,"it would be unsatisfactory to have a single offence, then the question is how best to divide up the forms and degrees of physical violation and of sexual assault.",2
644,We shall look first at physical violation.,2
645,"Although many cases of sexual assault also involve significant physical violation, this is not always so, and the essence of many sexual assaults lies in their destruction of the freedom of choice in the most intimate area of personality, and in psychological damage.",2
646,"By considering physical violations first, this will enable us to identify more accurately the distinctive element in sexual assaults.",2
647,"The general term ‘sexual assault’ is used here to include non-consensual sexual offences: there are various forms of sexual activity which are criminal they are indulged in consensually by adults of sound mind, and there was a brief discussion of these in Chapter 2.1 and 2.4 (b).",2
648,8.2 REPORTED PHYSICAL VIOLATIONS,2
649,"Recent decades have seen significant increases in the numbers of offences of violence reported to, and recorded by, the police.",2
650,"Between 1974 and 1984 the rise was 72 , slightly above that for all recorded offences (69 ).",2
651,"The increases were lowest in the most serious forms of violent offences, and highest in the less serious offences of violence and in robbery.",2
652,"Three-quarters of these offences each year are ‘cleared up’, and it transpires that most of them are committed by young males aged between 14 and 29.",2
653,"It seems that the use of a weapon is important in determining the legal classification of offences (not surprisingly, since offences involving weapons may tend to have more serious consequences): some three-quarters of the serious woundings involved a weapon, whereas the proportion was only one-fifth for the less serious offences.",2
654,"Patterns of victimization vary: females are more likely to fall victim to violence in their homes; whilst males are more likely to fall victim to violence in a ‘road, street or park’, or in a place of recreation.",2
655,"This trend may in fact be more marked, since it is acknowledged that victims may be considerably reluctant to report, and police to record, offences of violence committed in the home.",2
656,"Recent studies are beginning to uncover the true extent of so-called ‘domestic’ violence, and many police forces have adopted more consistent policies of recording such incidents and dealing with them as true offences of violence.",2
657,Two particular points may be made about offences of physical violation.,2
658,"First, there is evidence of a strong correlation between drinking and violence, in the sense that large numbers of violent offences are committed after consuming alcohol.",2
659,"It may be added, , that most of those who drink alcohol do not commit offences of violence thereafter.",2
660,"But the first point remains, and means that the special rules relating to fault and intoxication, discussed in Chapter 6.3, come into play.",2
661,A second general point is  that many offences of violence have consequences for the victim which extend well beyond any injury caused.,2
662,"There are psychological effects of fear and depression, which may significantly impair the victim's enjoyment of life long after the physical wounds have healed.",2
663,Such effects are well documented in the case of female victims of ‘domestic’ violence.,2
664,The values which underlie the offences of physical violation are not far to seek.,2
665,"They are the values of physical autonomy and freedom from molestation, the liberty to decide for oneself the level of pain to subject one's body to (e.g. in sport).",2
666,"The value of privacy is central here: the body is part of one's private identity, and, any physical hurt inflicted by violence, a violent assault constitutes a challenge to one's personal identity, peace, and wellbeing.",2
667,OFFENCES OF NON-FATAL PHYSICAL VIOLATION,2
668,We have seen something of the various situations in which non-fatal physical harm might occur.,2
669,How does the law classify its offences?,2
670,"How should it respond to these various invasions of physical integrity, a quality which is highly valued by most citizens?",2
671,"One approach would be to create separate offences to cover many of the situations in which violence occurs, and to single out those situations in which there is some element of aggravation, attacks on law-enforcement officers.",2
672,"This was the nineteenth-century English approach, and many such offences still survive in the Offences against the Person Act 1861 (relating, , to injuries caused by gunpowder, throwing corrosive fluid, failing to provide food for apprentices, setting spring guns).",2
673,A second approach would be to attempt to rank the offences by reference to the degree of harm caused and the degree of fault in the person causing it.,2
674,"The 1861 Act also contains some offences of this kind, but, as we shall see below, its ranking is impaired by obscure terms, uncertainties in the fault requirements, and some overlapping.",2
675,Thorough reform of the law is long overdue.,2
676,(a) Attempted Murder,2
677,"If we were to construct a ‘ladder’ of non-fatal offences, starting with the most serious and moving down to the least serious, the offence  of attempted murder should be placed at the top.",2
678,"There is an immediate paradox here though: attempted murder may not involve the infliction of any harm , since a person who shoots at another and misses may still be held guilty of attempted murder.",2
679,"What distinguishes this offence is proof of an intention to kill, not the occurrence of any particular harm.",2
680,"The fault element for attempted murder is therefore high — higher than for murder, under English law, since murder may be committed by someone who merely intended to cause really serious injury and not death.",2
681,An intention to kill must be proved to convict someone of attempted murder.,2
682,"Beyond that, all that is necessary is proof that D did something which was ‘more than merely preparatory’ towards the murder.",2
683,"Although a conviction is perfectly possible where no harm results — and such a case might still be regarded as a most serious non-fatal offence, since D tried to cause death, and the subjective principles confirm the high guilt — there are also cases where D's attempt to kill results in serious injury to the victim.",2
684,In such cases a prosecution might be brought for attempted murder — and will succeed if the intention to kill can be proved.,2
685,"However, the court might not be satisfied of that ‘beyond reasonable doubt’, and might find that D only intended to cause grievous bodily harm.",2
686,"In that event, the conviction will be for the offence of causing grievous bodily harm, but both offences carry the same maximum punishment — life imprisonment.",2
687,(b) Wounding or Grievous Bodily Harm (GBH) with Intent,2
688,Section 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 creates a serious offence which may be committed in a number of different ways.,2
689,"There are two alternative forms of conduct, and either of two forms of intent will suffice.",2
690,The conduct may be either causing a wound or causing grievous bodily harm.,2
691,A wound has been defined as an injury which breaks both the outer and inner skin — a bruise or a burst blood-vessel in an eye would not amount to a wound.,2
692,"Grievous bodily harm has never been defined with any precision, and the authoritative description is ‘really serious harm’.",2
693,"Turning  to the fault requirements, the one most commonly relied on in prosecutions is ‘with intent to cause grievous bodily harm’.",2
694,The meaning of ‘intention’ here is the same as outlined earlier.,2
695,"It was observed above that most serious woundings involve the use of a weapon, and that may make it easier to establish intention.",2
696,"Where the prosecution fails to establish intention, the offence will be reduced to the lower category, to be considered in section 8.3 (c) below, recklessness is proved.",2
697,But there is an alternative fault element: ‘with intent to prevent the lawful apprehension or detainer of any person’.,2
698,"Whilst the policy of this requirement — classifying attacks on persons engaged in law enforcement as especially serious — is perfectly understandable, one result of the wording of section 18 of the 1861 Act is that D can be convicted of this offence (with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment) if he simply pushes a police-officer to prevent an arrest, and the officer loses balance, falls awkwardly, and suffers serious injury.",2
699,"There is no requirement that such serious results should have been foreseen or foreseeable, D was trying to prevent an arrest.",2
700,This is a stark example of constructive criminal liability.,2
701,(c) Reckless Wounding or GBH,2
702,Section 20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 creates the offence of unlawfully and maliciously wounding or inflicting grievous bodily harm.,2
703,"The conduct element in this offence is similar to that for the more serious offence under section 18, and the meanings of ‘wound’ and ‘grievous bodily harm’are no different.",2
704,"Considerable attention has been focused on the distinction between grievous bodily harm (section 18) and grievous bodily harm (section 20): for many years it was believed that the more restrictive word ‘inflict’ meant that section 20 required proof of a sufficiently direct action by D to constitute an assault, but the House of Lords has now decided that there can be an ‘infliction’of GBH without proof of an assault.",2
705,"The decision is controversial in its reasoning, but it may be explained as an attempt by the judiciary to improve the workability of an ageing legal structure.",2
706,"The main difference between sections 18 and 20 lies in the fault element, and it is a considerable difference.",2
707,Section 18 requires intention.,2
708,"Section 20 requires recklessness, in the common-law sense of the conscious taking of an unjustified risk.",2
709,"The fault element in section 20 has been further broadened by the decision in (1968): there is no need to prove recklessness wounding or grievous bodily harm, the court is satisfied that D was reckless some physical harm to some person, albeit of a minor character.",2
710,"This is another example of constructive liability, and it is particularly inappropriate here, the law is aiming to produce a ‘ladder’ of offences graded relative seriousness.",2
711,"However, even without the extension, one might ask whether the distinction between intention (section 18) and recklessness (section 20) is so wide in crimes of violence, often impulsive reactions to events, warrant the difference in maximum penalties between life imprisonment and five years' imprisonment.",2
712,(d) Aggravated Assaults,2
713,"Common assault is the lowest rung of the ‘ladder’ of non-fatal offences, with a maximum penalty of six months' imprisonment, and it is discussed in more detail below.",2
714,"But certain aggravated assaults are singled out by the law for higher maximum penalties, and three of them may be mentioned here.",2
715,"One is assault with intent to rob, which, like robbery, carries a maximum of life imprisonment: it is, in effect, an offence of attempted robbery.",2
716,"Another aggravated offence is assault with intent to resist arrest or to prevent a lawful arrest, section 38 of the 1861 Act and carrying a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment.",2
717,"The third, which is usually regarded as representing the rung of the ‘ladder’ below reckless wounding or GBH (section 20) but above common assault, is assault occasioning actual bodily harm.",2
718,"The conduct element is causing ‘actual bodily harm’, which has been given the wide definition of ‘any hurt or injury calculated to interfere with the health or comfort of the victim’ it is not merely transient or trifling'.",2
719,"One consequence of the breadth of this  definition is that it has been held to cover psychological harm — where D causes V to become hysterical or to suffer substantial fear or fright, .",2
720,"24 Since research shows that this is a frequent and long-lasting result of many attacks, it is important that it be given some recognition.",2
721,"The fault required for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, section 47 of the 1861 Act, is now in doubt.",2
722,"Formerly, all that needed to be established was the fault required for common assault, i.e. intent or recklessness the application of some unlawful force to another.",2
723,This was open to the criticism that it imposed constructive liability: a person who risked a minor assault might be held guilty of a more serious offence if ‘actual bodily harm’ happened to result.,2
724,"Moreover, the maximum penalty for the section 47 offence is five years' imprisonment, with no apparent justification for the strange approach of making the equivalent to the higher offence on the ‘ladder’(the section 20 offence), and the equivalent to the lower offence on the ‘ladder’(common assault, with a maximum of six months' imprisonment).",2
725,"However, the Court of Appeal has now attempted to rectify the anomaly by holding that the prosecution must prove intention or recklessness physical harm, not a mere assault.",2
726,"The Court was critical of the antiquated and illogical structure of the 1861 Act, which causes practical problems and yet remains unreformed.",2
727,Section 51 of the Police Act 1964 contains the offence of assaulting a police-officer in the execution of his or her duty.,2
728,"Procedurally speaking, this is not an aggravated assault, since it carries the same maximum penalty as common assault (six months' imprisonment) and is also triable summarily only.",2
729,"However, in practice the courts tend to impose higher sentences for assaults on the police, and it is therefore worth noting that this offence is committed D was unaware that he was striking a police-officer.",2
730,"A decision by a single judge on assize in 1865 is still regarded as authority for this proposition, but there is surely little justification for this today.",2
731,"The  proper approach should be to convict D of the aggravated offence only where he knew that V was, or might be, a police-officer.",2
732,"Otherwise, a conviction for common assault is more appropriate.",2
733,(e) Common Assault,2
734,The lowest offence on the ‘ladder’ is what is known as common assault.,2
735,"Strictly speaking, the term ‘assault’ is used here in its generic sense, as including two separate types of offence, assault and battery.",2
736,"In simple terms, battery is the application of unlawful force to another person, whereas assault consists of causing another person to apprehend or expect the application of unlawful force.",2
737,"Most batteries involve an assault, and the tendency is to refer generically to ‘assaults’, but the exposition of the law is clearer if the two offences are kept separate.",2
738,The essence of a battery is the application of any unlawful force to another.,2
739,"Examples might include a push, a kiss, or throwing a projectile or water which lands on another person's body.",2
740,"Indeed, it seems that the merest touching of another may constitute a battery, and this prompts the question of whether the criminal law ought to extend to such trivial incidents.",2
741,"The traditional justification is that there is no other sensible dividing line, and that this declares the law's regard for the physical integrity of citizens.",2
742,"As Blackstone put it: ‘the law cannot draw the line between different degrees of violence, and therefore totally prohibits the first and lowest stage of it; every man's person being sacred, and no other having a right to meddle with it, in any the slightest manner.’",2
743,"Many unwanted touchings are ‘technical’ batteries, and prosecutors are relied upon to avoid prosecutions of minor incidents.",2
744,"One might be able to construct a law which penalized only those batteries which cause, or are likely to cause, significant annoyance, but it is doubtful whether the insertion of a (necessarily vague) standard would alter the nature of the problem.",2
745,"Individuals have a right not to be touched if they do not wish to be touched, since the body is private.",2
746,Someone who knowingly touches another without his consent violates this personal right as surely as if he had taken his property.,2
747,"This is most evident in cases of indecent assault, which may be committed by the least unwanted touching or stroking of one person's body by another.",2
748,"These are culpable acts, often regarded as being more serious than thefts of property.",2
749,"If the law is  to recognise the significance of the individual's physical integrity, then it must provide for offences of this kind some of the conduct falling within the definition of the offence is properly kept the courts by prosecutorial discretion.",2
750,There are a number of disputed points about the ambit of the offence of battery.,2
751,"There is no clear decision on whether battery can be committed by the indirect application of force by digging a hole into which people subsequently fall, , but there are judicial statements including indirect force.",2
752,"One major problem is that if the offence is defined to include all touchings to which the victim does not consent, it seems difficult to exclude everyday physical contact with others.",2
753,This could be resolved by assuming that all citizens impliedly consent to those touchings which are incidental to ordinary everyday life and travel; but the judicial preference seems to be to create an exception for ‘all physical contact which is generally acceptable in the ordinary conduct of daily life’.,2
754,"The cases decide that this exception extends to touching a person to attract attention, although there can be no exception when the person touched has made it clear that he or she does not wish to be touched again.",2
755,The problem arose in ,2
756,"(1984), where a police — officer, not empowered to arrest D, touched D to attract her attention and then subsequently took hold of D's arm.",2
757,"D proceeded to scratch the police — officer's arm, having previously made it clear — in colourful language — that she did not wish to talk to the police — officer.",2
758,"The Divisional Court quashed D's conviction for assaulting a police-officer in the execution of her duty, on the ground that the officer herself had assaulted D by taking hold of D's arm.",2
759,The key issue here was D's obvious refusal of consent to any touching; in other cases there might be a general issue of whether the touching goes ‘beyond generally acceptable standards of conduct’.,2
760,A number of decisions have suggested what appears to be an alternative Approach: to ask whether D's touching was ‘hostile’.,2
761,"This seems to be an inferior method of identifying the question of the boundaries of permissible conduct, and it is arguable whether this requirement forms part of the criminal law.",2
762,"The essence of the crime of assault, as distinct from battery, is that it involves an apprehension of the immediate application of unlawful force.",2
763,"It is therefore possible to have a battery without an assault (e.g. where D strikes V from behind), an assault without a battery (e.g. where D threatens to strike V but is prevented from doing so), but most cases involve both.",2
764,"One disputed point is whether words alone can constitute an assault: the preponderance of authority is probably that mere words, unaccompanied by any threatening conduct, cannot amount to an assault, but if the point of the offence is to penalize the creation of fear of imminent attack, it is difficult to see why utterances ‘Get out the knives’ or ‘Let's hit them’should be regarded more indulgently than a raised hand.",2
765,Another disputed issue concerns the ambit of immediacy.,2
766,"In one case the Divisional Court held that assault was committed where a woman was frightened by the sight of a man looking in through the window of her house, although there seems to have been little suggestion that the man was threatening to apply force either immediately or .",2
767,The decision might be explained as an attempt to remedy the absence of an offence which penalizes such .,2
768,"It is a different matter if D intends to cause, and does cause V to the immediate application of force in a case where none is objectively likely (e.g. the gun which D points at V is a toy).",2
769,"That clearly fulfils the definition of assault, and rightly so.",2
770,What fault element is required for assault and battery?,2
771,The law is now settled that either intention or recklessness the respective conduct elements is sufficient.,2
772,"After a brief period of uncertainty, it is now clear that common-law recklessness, not recklessness, is the relevant test.",2
773,"There remains, however, a question of principle which has not been fully considered: should the fault element in offences against the person be widened to criminalize some negligent causing of physical harm?",2
774,"If physical integrity is so highly valued, would it be inappropriate to make it clear that an  offence would be committed by any normal adult who failed to see an obvious risk of physical harm to another?",2
775,(f) Questions of Consent,2
776,"to explain why offences of violence are regarded so seriously, reference has been made to the value a of privacy and physical integrity.",2
777,"However, if individual autonomy is to be regarded as one of the fundamental values, the question arises of whether individuals might consent to the infliction of physical harm on themselves.",2
778,The owner of property can consent to someone destroying or damaging that property.,2
779,We shall see below that consent may constitute the difference between the sexual expression of shared love between two people and the serious offence of rape.,2
780,"If a person wishes to give up his physical integrity in certain circumstances, or to risk it for the sake of sport or excitement, should the criminal law allow the consent to negative what would otherwise be a crime?",2
781,The Court of Appeal was asked to rule on this question in ,2
782,).,2
783,The reference concerned a fight in the street between two youths to settle an argument.,2
784,The essence of the court's answer was that ‘It is not in the public interest that people should try to cause or should cause actual bodily harm for no good reason.’,2
785,"In other words, the Court held that, if the fight merely involves assault or battery, consent can be effective as a defence.",2
786,But if the results constitute actual bodily harm — which extends to ‘any hurt or injury calculated to interfere with the health or comfort of the victim’— consent cannot be a defence.,2
787,This applies whether the fight takes place or .,2
788,The Lord Chief Justice added that:,2
789,"Nothing which we have said is intended to cast doubt on the accepted legality of properly conducted games and sports, lawful chastisement or correction, reasonable surgical interference, dangerous exhibitions, etc.",2
790,"These apparent exceptions can be justified as involving the exercise of a legal right, in the case of chastisement or correction, or as needed in the public interest, in the other cases.",2
791,This passage is somewhat unsatisfactory in its lack of certainty and in the wide discretion it appears to leave to the courts.,2
792,"It is true that the did not confront these particular issues directly, and the Lord Chief Justice perhaps intended no more than a sweeping reference to other kindred situations.",2
793,"But the allusion to ‘properly conducted’ games or sports is vague, and the notion that such dangerous exhibitions as circus acts or trying to vault over twelve buses on a motorcycle are ‘needed’in the public interest seems strained.",2
794,Beneath all these particular situations there are conflicting values which claim the law's attention.,2
795,"Fundamental respect for individuals as autonomous, rational beings suggests that their liberty to risk injury or to undergo assaults, however serious, ought also to be respected.",2
796,"It is an aspect of self-determination: the point is conceded in the fact that suicide is an offence, and it should therefore follow that consent to injury should negative any offence.",2
797,"That argument is not watertight, however, because existing law does not allow euthanasia.",2
798,"What distinguishes suicide from euthanasia is that the former is the individual's own act, whereas the latter involves the direct act of another.",2
799,Why should this make so great a difference?,2
800,"It seems that problems of proof loom large here: there is a fear that the unscrupulous would manipulate any law permitting ‘mercy killings’, and the argument is presumably that this would put at risk more unwilling parties than a law allowing euthanasia would benefit willing parties.",2
801,"There are those, however, who find it objectionable that one person should ever be permitted to take the life of another.",2
802,"If we bring the argument back to consent to non-fatal physical harm, we may recall that the Lord Chief Justice relied on the phrase ‘not in the public interest’ to justify the restrictions.",2
803,This phrase must be regarded as the starting-point for analysis as an explanation.,2
804,"One reason that he ruled out was the argument, derived from earlier cases, that fights should be prohibited because they tend to create disorder.",2
805,"This may be true, but there are other offences to deal with that aspect, and, in any case, violence raises the same issues of physical integrity and self-determination.",2
806,"Another old argument is that ‘manly sports’ help to keep people fit to fight for the Crown if necessary, whereas fights which involve maiming rob the Crown of able-bodied men for  the armed forces.",2
807,"Although this precise reasoning is of doubtful relevance today, it contains the seeds of an argument to the effect that the public interest lies in having a society with fit and healthy citizens.",2
808,"Several laws have been passed in modern times to restrict dangerous activities and to impose criminal sanctions on citizens who fail to protect themselves against injury — , the offences of failing to wear a safety helmet when riding a motor cycle, and failing to wear a safety harness when travelling in the front seat of a car.",2
809,"Such laws are partly paternalistic, based on the argument that the State is in a better position to assess the risks of injury, and partly economic, in the sense that conformity with the law would save millions of pounds in medical expenses (as well as much grief for citizens).",2
810,Thus one social argument which might be mobilised the rule in the case is that the savings of medical expenses resulting from conformity with the law are more important than the liberty of individual citizens to engage in fights.,2
811,That is a matter for debate.,2
812,A further paternalistic argument is that a law restricting consent helps to protect individual citizens from themselves by counteracting some of the social pressures and shame which might otherwise occur.,2
813,"The criminal law took a strong line against duelling in the nineteenth century, despite the notions of honour which still regarded it as appropriate or correct for settling certain disputes.",2
814,"Similar pressures might be felt by some people today — to fight, or to risk injury in certain situations, .",2
815,"On the other hand, the extent to which judicial decisions can influence patterns of social behaviour must remain an open question.",2
816,"Physical sports would probably be widely accepted as an exception to restrictive rules on consent, but two points must be borne in mind.",2
817,"First, there has been a growing number of prosecutions in recent years for injuries resulting from organized matches of Association and Rugby football.",2
818,"It is accepted that not every ‘foul’ committed in breach of the rules amounts to a crime, and it seems to be assumed that players do, and may lawfully, consent to physical force over and above the minimum permitted by the rules.",2
819,"But this does not exclude the possibility of convictions for the use of physical  force well beyond that which may reasonably be expected in a game: the borderline is vague, but presumably the courts will decide particular cases by reference to the degree of violence used, its relation to the play in the game, any evidence of intent, .",2
820,"Second, there should be constant reappraisal of the suitability of certain forms of ‘sport’.",2
821,"Advances in medical knowledge might lead to the conclusion that some are simply too dangerous: there has long been a debate about the status of boxing, with increasing knowledge of the risks of brain damage to boxers.",2
822,"Here, as elsewhere, there are difficult questions to be answered: whether membership of a society should involve a positive duty to take care of one's body for the general social good, either to avoid becoming a burden on other members of the community or even to preserve oneself as a positive contributor to that community.",2
823,"The question of ‘positive contribution’ raises again the issue of the social worth of sport, recreation and dangerous exhibitions.",2
824,(g) Offences under the Public Order Act 1986,2
825,"Despite its title, the Public Order Act creates some offences which apply whether the conduct takes place in a public or a private place.",2
826,Of particular relevance here are those offences which involve violence or the threat of violence.,2
827,"The Act provides a ‘ladder’ of offences, of which the most serious is riot (section i).",2
828,The essence of riot is the use of unlawful violence by two or more persons in a group of twelve persons who are using or threatening violence.,2
829,"The maximum penalty is ten years' imprisonment, compared with a maximum of five years for the lesser offence of violent disorder.",2
830,The essence of violent disorder (section 2) is the use or threat of unlawful violence in a group of three persons who are using or threatening violence.,2
831,"Beneath violent disorder comes the crime of affray (section 3), now defined threatening or using unlawful violence towards another, and carrying a maximum of three years' imprisonment.",2
832,"Affray may be committed by one individual, and, like the other offences, it may be committed in a private place.",2
833,"The term ‘violence’ includes conduct intended to cause physical harm and conduct which might cause harm (throwing a missile towards someone); and, for the two most serious offences of riot and violent disorder, ‘violence’bears an extended meaning which includes violent conduct towards property.",2
834,Is it necessary to have an extra ladder of offences so closely linked with the general ladder of offences of violence?,2
835,One reason might be the unsatisfactory state of the law under the Offences against the Person Act 1861: that Act fails to provide both a clear and defensible gradation of offences and any general offences of threatening violence against another.,2
836,"The provisions of the Public Order Act are, however, usually justified on other grounds.",2
837,"One supposed justification is that these extra offences are needed to cope with ‘group offending’, which causes fear in ordinary citizens, and extra difficulties for the police and for prosecutors (in obtaining persuasive evidence).",2
838,"Offences committed by groups may well occasion greater fear than offences committed by individuals, and it may also be true that groups have a tendency to do things which individuals might not do: there is a group bravado, a group pressure, which may lead to excesses.",2
839,"On the other hand, the criminal law already makes some provision for such cases.",2
840,"The law of conspiracy is aimed at group offending, but conviction depends on proof of some prior agreement.",2
841,"The law of complicity enables the conviction of people who aid and abet others to commit offences, and spreads a fairly wide net in doing so.",2
842,"However, the law of complicity is technical, and the 1986 Public Order Act is a response to the call for a simplified and more ‘practical’ scheme of offences for dealing with public disorder.",2
843,Thus the Act goes a long way in smoothing the path of the prosecutor.,2
844,"It is indeed an element of all three offences that the conduct must be would cause a person of reasonable firmness, present at the scene, to fear for his personal safety; and yet it is provided, for each offence, that ‘no person of reasonable firmness need actually be, or be likely to be, present at the scene’.",2
845,"This not only removes the need for the prosecutor to prove this element, but also removes part of the rationale for the offences.",2
846,"This is ‘practical’ in the sense that the prosecution need not rely on members of the public to come forward and give evidence, which there is often a reluctance to do.",2
847,But one effect of this is to limit the opportunities for the defence to contest the issue.,2
848,"Another justification for having separate ‘public order’ offences is that group activities of this kind may, over and above the features discussed above, constitute a special threat to law enforcement and the political system.",2
849,This argument comes close to a constitutional paradox — that people who are protesting against the fairness of the political system may find themselves convicted of serious offences because their mode of protest is a realistic one.,2
850,"There ought to be a right to protest , it might be argued, and where the exercise of this right happens to lead to some form of disorder, it is wrong to visit the perpetrators with severe sanctions.",2
851,The counter-argument is that peaceful protest is one thing but violent protest crosses the boundaries of acceptability; the value of physical integrity is such that violence and threats of violence ought not to be downgraded simply because their origins lie in some political protest.,2
852,"One problem here is that the two most serious offences include violence against property, conviction may result from threats against a person's property.",2
853,"Another issue is whether a refurbished general code of offences against the person, including clearly graded offences and ‘threats’ offences, would not cater adequately for these occasions.",2
854,This brings the argument back to the justifications for those provisions of the Public Order Act which smooth the path of the prosecutor with dispensations from proof.,2
855,"And yet there remains the fact, noted at the outset, that the Act applies to violence and violent threats .",2
856,Practical experience will determine whether this heralds an assimilation of prosecution policy within public disorder and private or ‘domestic’ violence.,2
857,Would this strengthen the case for a set of offences skewed towards the prosecution?,2
858,(h) Causing Illness,2
859,The Offences against the Person Act 1861 contains a number of crimes concerned with the administration of noxious or toxic substances.,2
860,Section 22 penalizes the use of any overpowering drug or substance ‘with intent to enable the commission of an arrestable offence’(maximum sentence of life imprisonment).,2
861,Section 23 penalizes the intentional or reckless administration of any poison or noxious thing which results in danger to the victim's life or grievous bodily harm (maximum sentence of ten years' imprisonment).,2
862,"Section 24 penalizes the administration of any poison or noxious  thing, ‘with intent to injure, aggrieve or annoy the victim’(maximum sentence of five years).",2
863,"This section has been applied to cover the administration of a drug which causes harm to the victim's metabolism by overstimulation, if D's motive for this is malevolent benevolent.",2
864,"The three offences seem to provide a ‘ladder’ but, , the distinctions between them vary considerably, with section 23 being more concerned about the result than about D's fault.",2
865,"It seems likely that a redefinition of the principal crimes of physical violation would cover most of these cases anyway, and the Criminal Law Revision Committee saw the need to supplement the general offences with only one special offence — administering to another, without his consent, any substance which D knows to be capable of interfering substantially with the other's bodily functions.",2
866,(i) Neglect of Duty,2
867,Several of the offences discussed above may be committed by omission.,2
868,"One can cause grievous bodily harm by omission, and a person who does so intentionally in a case where a duty of care exists may be convicted under section 18 of the 1861 Act.",2
869,"An example would be starving a child for whom one has parental responsibility, with the result that the child suffers serious harm.",2
870,"It is unclear whether battery can be committed by omission, but it is certainly possible to convict of battery someone who accidentally causes the unlawful application of force to another and then intentionally desists from stopping that application of force.",2
871,"The example is the famous case in which a man unintentionally drove his car a police-officer's foot and then declined to remove it, for a minute or two, when asked.",2
872,"There are also cases in which the criminal law creates special offences attached to certain duties of care, of which the parent's duty towards a child is one example.",2
873,Section 1 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 contains an elaborately worded offence which may be termed ‘child neglect’.,2
874,"It consists, essentially, of wilfully assaulting, ill-treating, neglecting, abandoning, or exposing a child in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury  to health.",2
875,"The maximum penalty for child neglect is now ten years' imprisonment, which should be sufficient to deal with cases involving considerable fault and actually or potentially serious consequences.",2
876,"The Mental Health Act 1983 contains a somewhat similar offence of ill-treating or wilfully neglecting a patient in a mental hospital, which has a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment.",2
877,"(j) Weapons, Motor Vehicles, and Endangerment",2
878,Most of the offences considered above involve the occurrence of physical harm plus intention or recklessness.,2
879,"It is also justifiable, however, for the criminal law to penalise conduct which may lead to the causing of physical harm, particularly in situations where the conduct has little social utility or where the risk is well known.",2
880,"In fact, English criminal law has a wide range of such offences, of which those involving firearms, offensive weapons, motor vehicles, and other endangerment will be outlined here.",2
881,"The Firearms Act 1968 sets out to control the possession of firearms and ammunition, and contains several offences.",2
882,"The basic offence in section 1 is that of possessing a firearm without a certificate, an offence which (despite elements of strict liability) carries a maximum of three years' imprisonment.",2
883,"The Act also contains a number of aggravated offences of possessing a firearm with various intents, and these were set out in Chapter 7.7 above.",2
884,"Lower down the scale comes the offence of possessing an offensive weapon without lawful authority or excuse, the Prevention of Crime Act 1953.",2
885,"This offence, with its maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment, encompasses two classes of weapon: first, an article made or adapted for use as a weapon; and second, any article intended for such use.",2
886,"Much attention has been focused on the concept of ‘reasonable excuse’, where the courts have attempted to impose a fairly stringent test on persons whose reason for carrying a weapon is said to be fear of attack.",2
887,"Where motor vehicles are concerned, the problems are different.",2
888,"Although they are no less lethal than firearms in their potential to cause injury or even death, their considerable social utility (indeed, the dependence of much social interaction on them) indicates the need for a different approach.",2
889,"That approach consists of a code of good practice (The Highway Code), a requirement that drivers pass a qualifying test, and a network of offences to penalize those who deviate from proper standards.",2
890,"Leaving aside manslaughter and causing death by reckless driving, offences discussed in the previous chapter, the ladder of offences runs from reckless driving, through drunken driving and careless driving, down to various offences of failure to obey traffic signs and failure to maintain a vehicle in a roadworthy state.",2
891,"Reckless driving, section 2 of the Road Traffic Act 1972, is committed where D's driving creates an obvious and serious risk of causing physical injury to some other person or of doing substantial damage to property, and where D either saw the risk or failed to give any thought to the risk.",2
892,This is the test of and .,2
893,"The effect of restricting the offence to reckless driving, a restriction which was enacted in 1977 (previously it had included dangerous driving, a less demanding standard), has been that relatively few convictions for this offence are obtained.",2
894,"The offence immediately below is careless driving section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1972, which is committed by anyone who drives without due care and attention.",2
895,"This offence is punishable only with a fine, whereas reckless driving carries a maximum of two years' imprisonment.",2
896,The gap between the two offences is therefore considerable.,2
897,"The other major offence is drunken driving, an offence bristling with technicalities which carries a maximum prison sentence of six months' and a minimum period twelve months' disqualification from driving.",2
898,"This structure of serious road-traffic offences was recently examined by the North Committee, which came to the conclusion that the criminal law does not treat traffic offences with the gravity they deserve, given the potential consequences of any deviation from proper standards of driving.",2
899,"During the 1980s there was evidence of harsher  punishments being handed out to reckless drivers, and of a wider appreciation of the risks created and the misery inflicted by deviations from proper standards of driving.",2
900,"The North Committee recommended a reformulation of the offence of reckless driving to encompass ‘very bad driving’ of a wider kind, retaining careless driving as the lower offence.",2
901,"The essence of both offences would be the intrinsic quality of the driving and its deviation from the proper standard, not the consequences which happen to result or happen not to result in a particular case.",2
902,"However, the Committee did accept the relevance of resulting harm in one sphere, namely, in its proposal of a new offence of causing death by careless driving when over the alcohol limit.",2
903,This might be justified as a means of signalling the connection between drunken driving and fatal accidents.,2
904,"It is open to the obvious objection that it focuses on an outcome which may be a matter of pure chance: if such driving happens not to result in death, the charge will merely be drunken driving.",2
905,One reply to this is that most offences of bad driving have the potential to cause death or serious injury; and that the North Committee's proposals the element of endangerment where no harm occurs -value the resulting harm where it does occur.,2
906,The question of endangerment has already been raised in a more general fashion in Chapter 7.7.,2
907,"English criminal law contains a number of discrete offences of endangerment, created in particular circumstances to deal with particular problems.",2
908,", the road-traffic offences, there are offences under sections 32 and 33 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 of endangering railway passengers; there are the offences under section 1(2) of the Criminal Damage Act 1971 of endangering the lives of others by causing damage to property (usually by fire); the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 penalizes employers for failure to ensure that employees are not exposed to risks to their health or safety; and there are offences, that under section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987, of selling goods in contravention of safety regulations.",2
909,"These are all offences of endangerment, in the  sense that no harm need have resulted from the dangerous behaviour.",2
910,Their importance lies in the value of the interest in freedom from physical violation.,2
911,"However, they do not accord with traditional conceptions of crime — perhaps because many of the offences may be committed in ‘normal’, situations, driving a car or conducting a business — and this may tend to obscure their direct relation to the issue of physical safety.",2
912,It was argued in Chapter 2.5 and 2.6 that social attitudes towards various sources of harm are too hidebound by convention and ought to be re-examined.,2
913,Chapter 7.7 commended the approach of the American Model Penal Code in creating a general offence of endangerment.,2
914,"A different approach would be to introduce recklessness into the non-fatal offences of causing injury, labelling cases of endangerment in the same way as ‘traditional’ crimes.",2
915,This would only be effective if it were accompanied by changes in policing practice and prosecution policy.,2
916,"The advantage would be that the law would move closer towards proportionality based on degree of harm and degree of risk, untrammelled by conventional views of what does and what does not count as ‘crime’.",2
917,(k) The Structure of the Non-Fatal Offences,2
918,"This survey has shown that, generally speaking, the existing range of offences seems to emphasize the result, the degree of foresight and the status of the victim as the critical issues in grading crimes of physical violation.",2
919,"The crimes in the 1861 Act form a somewhat shakily constructed ladder, with rather more overlapping of offences and elements of constructive liability than is necessary.",2
920,"Factors which undoubtedly influence judgments of seriousness, the existence of provocation, or the difference between premeditated and impulsive violence, are accorded no legal significance and are left to the sentencing stage.",2
921,"The main exception to this concerns the status of the victim, with separate offences for assaults on police-officers and wilful neglect of children, .",2
922,How might the non-fatal offences be reformed to conform with the principle of fair labelling?,2
923,The approach recommended by  the Criminal Law Revision Committee illustrates the difficulties.,2
924,The Committee proposed three major offences in the field between attempted murder and common assault: causing serious injury with intent to cause serious injury; causing serious injury recklessly; and causing injury either with intent or recklessly.,2
925,"Separate offences for cases involving police-officers and children would be retained, to mark out the extra heinousness of such crimes .",2
926,"The scheme depends chiefly on the seriousness of the harm caused and the degree of foresight, though in a much more structured fashion than the 1861 Act.",2
927,There are three obvious difficulties.,2
928,"First, what is the meaning of ‘injury’?",2
929,"The only element specifically defined is that it includes unconsciousness; otherwise, its definition remains vague.",2
930,Second what is the distinction between injury and serious injury?,2
931,", it is left to the courts to draw the line their overall judgment of the facts.",2
932,"These are two respects in which the reformed law would not achieve maximum certainty, and those who argue that the terms would ‘cause little problem of interpretation’ are surely giving way to unwarranted optimism.",2
933,"Third, why are there two separate offences of causing serious injury — with intent, or recklessly — when the two mental states are combined in a single offence for mere injury?",2
934,"The Committee's view was that there is ‘a definite moral and psychological difference’ between causing serious injury with intent and causing serious injury recklessly, and that this difference should be reflected in separate offences.",2
935,"However, since it is ‘not an easy distinction for the police, magistrates and juries to have to make’, no attempt should be made to draw such a legal distinction at the lower level of ‘injury’ offences.",2
936,"to support this position, one has to accept:(i) that the intention — recklessness distinction is the most significant dividing line for serious injuries, more relevant than factors premeditation or provocation;(ii) that this is a workable distinction for the courts, especially in impulsive crimes, where the definition of intention may be fulfilled by a momentary realization of what is happening;(iii) that it is so significant that a difference in maximum penalties between life imprisonment and five years' imprisonment is appropriate; and (iv) that there is not a strong case for phrasing the  offences endangerment of causing physical harm.",2
937,"The Committee's proposals are a distinct improvement on the anomalies of the 1861 Act, but they leave these four issues open to doubt.",2
938,8.4 REPORTED SEXUAL ASSAULTS,2
939,The kinds of sexual assault reported to the police cover an enormous range of conduct.,2
940,"Among the most serious are those now defined as rape (sexual intercourse without consent), and about one-sixth of these cases involve the perpetration of further sexual indignities upon the victim.",2
941,"Reported rapes have increased considerably in the 1980s, but it is difficult to tell to what extent this represents a real increase in the number of rapes or an increase in the reporting of them.",2
942,"The approach of the police to the investigation of rape cases has been much criticism — and then to considerable improvement — and it seems quite possible that these improvements, together with the advent of rape-crisis centres and victim-support facilities, have led more women to report rapes than did so formerly.",2
943,"Reporting a rape remains a strenuous and harrowing experience, however, and it is likely to continue as an underreported offence.",2
944,"Another serious offence is buggery (intercourse per anum), but that constitutes a crime whether committed consensually or non-consensually, and it is the non-consensual form which ranks as a serious sexual assault.",2
945,"Many of the other forms of sexual assault on males or females do not take the form of sexual intercourse as defined in the offences of rape and buggery, and English law classifies these as indecent assaults.",2
946,"This offence, with a maximum penalty of ten years' imprisonment, covers a wide range of conduct, from a stolen kiss on the cheek to forced fellatio (oral sex).",2
947,"Then there is a group of offences which prohibit sexual activities with young people, whether they appear to consent or not: whilst there is little dispute about the need for some such offences, there is room for disagreement on the proper boundaries of the criminal law and on the role of prosecutorial discretion.",2
948,"The offence of incest prohibits certain sexual relations within the family, thus providing a distinct label for some forms of child sexual abuse by  parents and grandparents, although it also covers brother — sister relationships.",2
949,"Before we consider each of these offences in outline, let us examine the practical and theoretical foundations for them.",2
950,The practical effects of sexual assault can be considerable.,2
951,"There are well-documented consequences of rape victimization: some authorities write of a ‘rape trauma syndrome’, signifying deep disruption of the victim's life-pattern and thought-processes not just the physical effects of rape (physical pain, inability to sleep, prolonged distress), but also the effects on well-being (new-found fears, mistrust of surroundings and other people, embarrassment, ).",2
952,Young's New Zealand report concludes that ‘rape is an experience which shakes the foundations of the lives of the victims.,2
953,"For many its effect is a long-term one, impairing their capacity for personal relationships, altering their behaviour and values and generating fear.’",2
954,"There is no reason to suppose that such effects are confined to the victims of rape as traditionally defined: although sexual assaults vary in their degree, there may be many other forms of sexual assault which are serious enough to create such profound physical and psychological after-effects.",2
955,"What, then, are the interests typically threatened or destroyed by sexual assaults?",2
956,They may be described generally sexual autonomy and sexual choice.,2
957,"The argument must begin from the proposition that our body is our own: it is our private zone, and respect for privacy and personal autonomy both support this.",2
958,"Since these values are high among those which the criminal law ought to respect, no further demonstration of this starting-point is necessary.",2
959,"Each citizen may be said to have the right not to have sexual choices imposed on him or her; whether the law should go further, and hold that each citizen has the right to pursue his or her sexual choices consensually with another (public-decency laws and to the protection of the young), is a question to be considered separately.",2
960,Is respect for sexual choice any more important than respect for another's property rights?,2
961,The answer to this requires us to assess the relative centrality of sexual choice to life choices and living standards.,2
962,"It may be argued that sexuality has a certain uniqueness which is absent from much property: sexuality is an intrinsic part of one's personality, it is a mode of expressing that personality others, and it is therefore fundamental that one should  be able to choose whether to express oneself in this way — and, if so, towards and with whom.",2
963,The essence of such self-expression is that it should be voluntary.,2
964,"Thus, even where a sexual assault involves no significant physical force, it constitutes harm in the sense that it invades a deeply personal zone, gaining non-consensually that which should only be shared consensually.",2
965,"this formulation of ‘taking without permission’ sounds too close to an analogy with theft, it must be emphasized that the crucial element in sexual assault resides in the close interrelationship between the body and the personality.",2
966,"This close relationship, some would say identity, emphasizes that central values autonomy and privacy are bound up in all sexual cases.",2
967,"It is the threat to these values which brings the real, deep, and sometimes long-lasting effects of sexual assault.",2
968,"There can therefore be little doubt that, , sexual assaults constitute a substantially more serious form of harm than mere property offences — which is not to deny that some forms of theft or destruction of property can be more serious than some minor sexual assaults.",2
969,"There is much to suggest that the attitudes of society towards sexual offences, particularly the attitudes of many men (who hold most of the leading posts in the making of policy and law), have tended to undervalue the seriousness of sexual assaults.",2
970,"Among the manifestations of these attitudes are the statements of some defendants in rape trials, which may show an indifference towards the wishes of women, or a belief that the wearing of attractive clothes or an invitation to coffee is a sure sign of willingness to engage in sex; and the attitudes of some police-officers in the early 1980s, influenced by any one of a number of assumptions about the prevalence of false complaints of rape, about the ‘typical’ rape as an attack by a stranger, about the presence of injuries or bruises in ‘genuine’rapes, .",2
971,Recent years have seen a growing awareness that most of these assumptions about rape are myths.,2
972,"The police have improved both their procedures and their training, but it is not known whether social attitudes have changed greatly.",2
973,"Studies of rape in England and Wales suggest that two-thirds of rapes take place in the home of the victim or the offender, and that only one-third involve strangers; that two-fifths of victims suffer physical violence rape, and one-sixth suffer additional  sexual indignities; that recent years have seen an increase in the reporting of rapes between acquaintances, and that rapes are increasing in their intrinsic seriousness (i.e. the violence used, other sexual acts, etc), but that the most significant rise has been in the average length of sentences imposed on rapists by the courts.",2
974,"Longer sentences may be applauded by some, but it is doubtful whether they will make any significant contribution to the protection of women.",2
975,"A recent Home Office survey concludes that there is no simple solution to the prevention of rape, ‘the willingness both to question and to change the pattern of social life’.",2
976,"The argument is that serious sexual assaults, and the attitude of many men towards them, derive from a male-dominated approach to sexuality in which aggressive sexual behaviour by males is praised or condoned whilst women are associated with passivity.",2
977,"To alter this cluster of attitudes to one in which sexuality is seen as an expression of an equal, sharing relationship will require a widespread change in social attitudes through education and other media.",2
978,8.5 NON-CONSENSUAL SEXUAL INTERCOURSE,2
979,"The structure of sexual offences in English criminal law places rape and buggery at the top of the ‘ladder’, each carrying a maximum of life imprisonment, with the offences of attempted rape (maximum penalty of life imprisonment) and indecent assault (maximum penalty of ten years) beneath them.",2
980,"The conduct which constitutes rape is unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman without her consent; the fault element required is that the man intends to have sexual intercourse, and either knows that the woman is not consenting or ‘could not care less’ whether she is not consenting.",2
981,A number of issues arise for discussion.,2
982,(a) The concept of ‘Sexual Intercourse’,2
983,Rape is only committed where the man has sexual intercourse with the woman without her consent.,2
984,"Sexual intercourse is defined as the penetration of the penis into the vagina: ejaculation is not required, and the offence is committed penetration takes place, although it has been held that the offence continues throughout penetration (if the woman revokes her consent during intercourse and the man fails to withdraw, he commits rape).",2
985,"Is English law right to define rape in this way, and thereby to exclude from this offence such conduct as forced oral sex (fellatio), cunnilingus, and buggery?",2
986,"It can be argued that these offences may be no less traumatic for the victim than ‘conventional’ rape, and therefore that any attempt to classify sexual offences by reference to their seriousness should place these forms of sexual assault in the highest category.",2
987,"In its review of sexual offences the Criminal Law Revision Committee argued preserving the existing classification, on the basis that rape has a settled popular meaning and that the distinguishing feature of ‘conventional’ rape is the risk of pregnancy.",2
988,"However, the latter point fails to take account of the fact that rape is committed there is no ejaculation, and the woman is infertile, and it has been strongly argued that ‘penetration involving the penis, vagina or anus is perceived differently and regarded more seriously than other forms of penetration’.",2
989,"It may therefore be questioned whether English law takes the right approach in confining its most serious sexual offence, rape, so narrowly.",2
990,(b) Marital Rape,2
991,"Rape is only held to have been committed in English law where the sexual intercourse is ‘unlawful’, and it is generally assumed that the function of that term is to remove non-consensual intercourse between a man and his wife from the ambit of rape.",2
992,"If the man uses force or inflicts emotional shock on his wife to obtain sex, he is liable to conviction for assault occasioning actual bodily harm or some other offence against the person.",2
993,"But if he obtains his wife's submission to intercourse without resort to those means, there is no offence.",2
994,"The origins of this marital-rape exemption seem to lie in the notion that the wife is the husband's property, or that the wife promises intercourse on demand, but it has been defended in modern times on the basis that such cases raise essentially family matters, better suited to examination in a non-criminal court, and that in any case proof would be difficult.",2
995,"However, it is questionable whether the doors of the family home should be closed to the criminal law when so many offences of wife-battering, child battering, and sexual abuse of wives and children seem to go on behind them.",2
996,Are persons who inflict physical or sexual assault in the domestic context really less blameworthy than their counterparts on the street?,2
997,Are victims within the family any less worthy of the protection of the criminal law?,2
998,Should the criminal law really distinguish between unmarried and married couples when it comes to dealing with rape?,2
999,It is perhaps in recognition of the awkward position of English law that exceptions have been made to the marital-rape exemption in recent years.,2
1000,"Where the court is able to conclude that the wife's ‘implied consent to marital intercourse’ has been formally revoked, non-consensual intercourse by the husband amounts to rape.",2
1001,"This may be the case where there has been a separation order, a decree nisi for divorce, a non-molestation order, or a separation agreement between the parties.",2
1002,"However, these particular instances do not meet the general proposition that if the husband and wife have drifted apart, and the woman has made it known that she wants to have sex with her husband, it is wrong that the husband who has sex with her without her consent is exempt from conviction for rape.",2
1003,"There may be many reasons why the husband and wife do not make any formal agreement about separation, but this should not entitle a husband to return and force himself upon his wife weeks, months, or even years since he last saw her.",2
1004,"The inadequacy of this part of English law was signalled recently in (1988), where the Court of Appeal upheld an estranged husband's conviction for indecently assaulting his wife by forcing her to have oral sex with him.",2
1005,"The defence argument was that this  was a preliminary to ‘conventional’ intercourse, and that if the husband was exempt from liability for rape, he should equally be exempt from liability for indecent assault.",2
1006,The Court held that marriage does not imply consent to fellatio.,2
1007,This decision goes a long way towards demonstrating the untenability of the marital-rape exemption in modern times.,2
1008,"The Law Commission has now proposed the abolition of the marital-rape exemption, bringing English law into accord with the many other jurisdictions where it does constitute rape for a husband to have non-consensual sexual intercourse with his wife.",2
1009,"Reported cases are small in number, and it may be true that in some (not all) of these cases the degree of trauma suffered by the wife is less than if the rape had been by another man; but abolition of the marital-rape exemption is surely important as a statement of the married woman's autonomy and freedom of choice in sexual matters.",2
1010,"These fundamental values should not be jettisoned simply because marriage is a factor in the case, as indeed the Court of Appeal affirmed when holding that a husband may be convicted of kidnapping his wife.",2
1011,(c) Mistaken Belief in Consent,2
1012,The fault element in rape is that the man knows that the woman is not consenting or ‘could not care less’ that she is not consenting.,2
1013,"It would seem to follow from this that a man who that the woman is consenting, she is not, ought to be acquitted.",2
1014,"Lord Hailsham, in the leading decision of (16) held that this follows as a matter of ‘inexorable logic’.",2
1015,"It is not, then, a question of deciding on the elements of a ‘defence’ of mistake, because, where the man is mistaken, this means that he quite simply lacks the fault element required for the offence.",2
1016,It is not a ‘defence’ the negation of the elements of the crime.,2
1017,"So where, as in , defendants claim that they believed the woman was consenting, because her husband (who was present) had told them that she enjoyed a struggle, their case is simply that they lacked the fault element required for the crime.",2
1018,"The decision in has been hailed as a turning-point in English criminal law, the House of Lords resoundingly  affirmed the subjective principle of guilt.",2
1019,Fairness requires that we judge a defendant on the facts .,2
1020,"Previous decisions had held that a mistake must be based on reasonable grounds if it is to excuse, a doctrine which is illogical for the reason given by Lord Hailsham.",2
1021,"Where a crime requires knowledge or recklessness a certain circumstance, and the defendant holds a mistaken belief about that circumstance, logic demands that an acquittal should follow.",2
1022,"Moreover, the supporters of add, this should not lead to unmeritorious acquittals, because juries will not allow bogus defences to succeed: in itself the House of Lords was satisfied that the basis for the defence was so weak that a correctly directed jury would have found the defendants guilty.",2
1023,"However, it is possible to concede that defendants should be judged on the facts as they believe them to be, and yet to argue an exception in rape cases.",2
1024,"This would be a bold argument, since its thrust would be that is correct as a case on general principles but wrong as a rape decision.",2
1025,How might the argument run?,2
1026,One could argue that there are certain situations in which the risk of serious harm is so obvious that it would be right for the law to impose a duty to take care to ascertain the facts before proceeding.,2
1027,"In other words, mistakes must be based on reasonable grounds where the offences are serious — which would cover not only rape but also cases involving a risk of death or serious injury, the use of force in self-defence.",2
1028,"One drawback of this style of argument is that not only is the harm serious for the victim, but conviction for such an offence is serious for the defendant: a single class of offenders (rapists, serious wounders) would contain not only those with subjective fault but also those who merely failed to take proper care, all of whom would be convict.ed of a grave offence carrying a maximum of life imprisonment.",2
1029,"Perhaps a more fruitful line of argument is to emphasize that not only is rape a serious matter for the victim, but the ascertainment of one vital fact — consent — is a relatively easy matter for the man.",2
1030,"There is a clear contrast here between cases of the use of serious force in self-defence, where there may be a need to act instantaneously on a hastily formed view of the situation, and sexual intercourse with another, where consent or non-consent is the essence of the crime and can be ascertained by asking a plain question of the victim.",2
1031,Thus the argument is that the victim's right to autonomy and freedom of sexual choice does not need to yield to the principle that a defendant should be judged on the facts as he believes them to be; it would be so simple (the inevitable physical proximity of the man and woman) for the man to ascertain the facts here.,2
1032,", this involves a departure from the general subjective principle of criminal liability, since it involves imposing a duty on the defendant to ask about the victim's consent before continuing with his conduct.",2
1033,"But compared with the potential sacrifice of victims' rights, this duty is so undemanding that the arguments in its favour are powerful.",2
1034,"Critics will say that it converts rape into an offence of negligence, in one respect .",2
1035,"The answer is that it does, and that the justifications for doing so have been set out above — not so much because rape is a serious offence, but rather because ascertainment of the facts is so easy that there should be little substantive unfairness to defendants.",2
1036,"If the criminal law is to impose further duties on citizens, it is important to take account of the legality principles, particularly the principle of maximum certainty (see Chapter 3.3 (i) and (g)).",2
1037,This brings the discussion back to whether changes in social attitudes are the most effective way of preventing sexual victimization.,2
1038,"There is no shortage of examples of defendants in rape cases who assumed that a woman who said no really meant yes, or who inferred from other supposed clues (make-up, clothing, accepting a drink) that the victim had consented, despite her apparent protests.",2
1039,"Changing the law on mistake in rape could help to change these social attitudes, for some time to come defendants might find themselves charged with rape such ingrained attitudes towards women.",2
1040,(d) Reckless Rapes,2
1041,One of the many reactions to the decision of the House of Lords in (1982) was that it went against ,2
1042,and cut down its ambit.,2
1043,"In fact, although the two decisions are opposed in spirit, their practical spheres of operation can be separated.",2
1044,"For one thing,deals with cases where D has either recognized the risk or has failed to give any thought to it, whereas applies only where D has formed a distinct belief that the victim is consenting, a situation not explicitly covered by .",2
1045,"It may also be said that is concerned with foresight of consequences, whereas is concerned with knowledge of circumstances.",2
1046,"It is doubtful whether either of these distinctions would bear scrutiny  on the broader canvas of moral and social philosophy: the moral thrust of is that people are often just as much to blame for to think as they are for thinking about their actions and its consequences, and this very argument was applied to rape in the paragraphs above.",2
1047,"In fact, the definition of recklessness has not been followed in rape cases, that offence would seem to fulfil the criterion of being a modern statute in which the term ‘reckless’ is used.",2
1048,"The Court of Appeal's decisions have wavered somewhat, but the test which they now favour is that D is reckless if he ‘could not care less’ whether the woman is not consenting.",2
1049,"This test is ambiguous D must have thought about whether the woman is consenting, but there are those who argue that one cannot be said ‘not to care less’ about something unless one has considered it.",2
1050,"There are arguments here, as there are mistake, that the law should impose a duty on men to consider consent, and therefore should treat them as reckless if they have failed to give any thought to the matter.",2
1051,Plausible cases are likely to be extremely rare in practice.,2
1052,"(e) Fraud, Deception, and Consent",2
1053,How should the law deal with cases where the woman's consent to sexual intercourse stemmed from a mistake on her part?,2
1054,"English law has tended to confine narrowly the situations in which a mistake is held to negative the consent apparently given by the woman: only where the victim was made to believe that the man was her husband, or that the act to which she was being asked to consent was not sexual intercourse, is the mistake sufficiently fundamental to convert the apparently consensual sex into rape.",2
1055,"The latter question has arisen where young girls have been invited to submit to acts to train their voice or to improve their breathing — unbeknown to them, the act which they were permitting was sexual intercourse.",2
1056,"Other types of fraud and mistake are held to be insufficient for the offence of rape, and bring the case within the lesser offence of procuring a woman by false pretences or false representations to have unlawful sexual intercourse (section 3, Sexual Offences Act 1956, carrying a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment).",2
1057,Does the existing dividing line reflect the relative seriousness of  these mistake-related offences?,2
1058,"Since the identity of one's sexual partner may be assumed to be of fundamental significance, it is surely unjustified to give effect to this only where the mistake concerns whether the man is the woman's husband?",2
1059,"But there are wider issues here, too, implicit in the promiscuous use of the words ‘mistake’, ‘false representations’, ‘fraud’, .",2
1060,"Analogies with the effect of mistake in the law of contract may appear obvious, but it is questionable whether they are appropriate.",2
1061,The issues are: when the defendant should be convicted of a crime; how the crime should be labelled; and how seriously it should be viewed.,2
1062,"It could be argued, therefore, that the focus should not be the victim's mental state but the defendant's intentions.",2
1063,"If D set out to trick V into having sex, realising that she probably would not consent otherwise, are not his intention and his method sufficient to condemn him for rape, as they would be for obtaining property by deception?",2
1064,"Similarly, if D knowingly takes advantage of the fact that V is labouring under a mistaken belief to have sex with her, when (as he realises) she probably would not consent otherwise, should this not be sufficient?",2
1065,"The answer to those questions may be said to depend on whether it is generally as serious to obtain sex by deception as it is by other means (threats, force, fear).",2
1066,"In England the Criminal Law Revision Committee took the view that it is not, and therefore supported the division between fundamental deceptions (identity or the nature of the act) and lesser deceptions, placing the latter within the less serious category of procuring sex by deception.",2
1067,"this view, the woman who agrees to have sex with D only when he promises to marry her (never intending to keep this promise)— and because he has promised to marry her — is a victim not of rape but of the lesser offence of procuring sexual intercourse by false representations.",2
1068,"The Committee proposed to raise the maximum penalty for this offence to five years, but limited its recommendation to cases where D actively deceives V and failed to make any provision for cases where D takes advantage of a known mistake.",2
1069,"(f) Threats, Fear and Consent",2
1070,"More frequent in practice, and more problematic, are the cases involving threats and fear.",2
1071,"At one time it was the law that rape is  committed only where the woman submits through force, fear, or fraud.",2
1072,"This is a requirement, because decisions in the nineteenth century made it clear that rape can be committed whenever the woman does not consent — is asleep, , or too drunk to consent.",2
1073,"However, there are both practical and legal problems in cases where the woman says that she consented through fear only: she did not resist, because she thought that it would be hopeless in the circumstances, she was terrified, or she feared serious violence.",2
1074,"The practical problems are that there may be no evidence of violence on the woman's body, which usually means that the case will be a question of the victim's word against the defendant's; this may lead the police to be sceptical of the woman's complaint, or may incline the prosecutor to accept a plea of guilty to the lesser charge of indecent assault.",2
1075,"The legal problems are similar to those in the cases of mistake and deception: are all threats serious enough to justify regarding the crime as a rape, or should some threats be accommodated within a lesser offence?",2
1076,"English law has the lesser crime of procuring unlawful sexual intercourse by threats or intimidation, and appears to limit rape to those cases where there is a threat of violence.",2
1077,"However, there is a wider dimension to the question, which encompasses fear threats, and this hinges on the distinction between submission and consent.",2
1078,In the case of (1981) two girls were picked up by two men and taken to a remote house.,2
1079,The victim was already distressed after being raped by the other man when D announced his intention to have sex with her.,2
1080,"She asked him why he could not leave her alone, what the other man had already done to her, but he turned off the lights and told her to undress.",2
1081,She did not resist.,2
1082,The Court of Appeal rejected the defence argument that there must be actual violence or threats of violence for the offence to be classified as rape.,2
1083,It also rejected the Crown's argument that the issue of consent should be left to the jury — in the same way as the question of dishonesty is left to them in theft cases — but its actual decision comes fairly close to this position.,2
1084,"Thus, the jury should be instructed that the term ‘consent’ covers a whole range of situations from actual desire to reluctant acquiescence, and that the dividing line between real consent and mere submission must be drawn by the jury by applying its knowledge of human nature to the facts of the case.",2
1085,"The law of rape may therefore extend to threats threats of violence, but its boundaries are most uncertain.",2
1086,"Resort to such concepts as ‘common sense’ and ‘knowledge of human nature’, is little more than a veiled admission that no satisfactory criteria have been found.",2
1087,"The narrowest position is to say that rape is committed only where D threatens violence or knows that V is in fear of violence, and that any other threat must fall within the lesser offence of procuring sex by threats.",2
1088,"A broad position would be to hold that any threat may negative consent, and this might include a threat to send a compromising photograph to someone, a threat to report a driver for exceeding the speed limit, .",2
1089,"Among intermediate positions, one possibility is to draw an analogy with the offence of blackmail, holding that any unwarranted demand for sex with menaces should amount to rape, the menaces being either sufficient to influence an ordinary person or sufficient to influence the mind of this victim.",2
1090,"But the difficulty with this discussion is that it lacks a firm point of reference because it cannot be taken for granted that there should be two levels of offence, rape and procuring sex by threats.",2
1091,"If there is to be a single offence of serious sexual assault, there are arguments for including all cases of obtaining sex by fear or threats within that.",2
1092,"If the present division is regarded as desirable, the next step is to ensure that the maximum penalty for the lesser offence is sufficient to deal with cases of serious threats which are not enough to negative consent in rape.",2
1093,"Then one can address the question of whether rape should be confined to cases where submission arises from a threat or fear of violence, or whether it should be phrased more widely.",2
1094,"At that stage, questions about the appropriateness of labels, sentencing powers, and the principle of legality (certainty requirements) come to the fore.",2
1095,These questions will be considered on a broader canvas in section 8.7 below.,2
1096,8.6 OTHER NON-CONSENSUAL SEXUAL OFFENCES,2
1097,"So far the discussion has focused on the offence of rape in English law, which is confined to cases of ‘sexual intercourse’ where the penis penetrates the vagina.",2
1098,"Other kinds of sexual assault are classified in English law as buggery, attempted buggery or rape, or  indecent assault, and there are also offences against young people and the mentally disordered.",2
1099,These will be considered briefly before the general subject of sexual offences is re-examined.,2
1100,(a) Buggery,2
1101,"One of the circumstances constituting this offence is where the penis penetrate the anus of a male or a female, and the maximum penalty is life imprisonment.",2
1102,"The law therefore allows the offence to be treated just as seriously as rape, and we have seen how some would argue that it should be included as a form of rape, or as a form of the most serious offence of sexual assault, in any reformed law.",2
1103,"In ordinary parlance one might say that anyone who has been forcibly subjected to this offence has been raped; the psychological effects are likely to be deep, and there is no risk of pregnancy (as there is not from some rapes, since ejaculation is not part of the definition), there may be the risk of disease.",2
1104,(b) Attempted Rape or Attempted Buggery,2
1105,"If a defendant fulfils the requirements for the offence of rape or buggery but failed to achieve penetration, liability for attempted rape or attempted buggery may be possible.",2
1106,"These are serious offences, carrying the same maximum penalty as the full offences.",2
1107,A survey in the 1970s showed that almost one-third of rape charges resulted in conviction of attempted rape.,2
1108,"the law of attempts, the least that a defendant must be proved to have done is something ‘more than merely preparatory’ to sexual intercourse, with intent to have unlawful sexual intercourse without the woman's consent.",2
1109,Whether the prosecution can prove attempted rape the lesser offence of indecent assault will often depend on proof of the defendant's intention to go beyond the indecent acts already committed.,2
1110,"A legal problem has arisen here defendants who ‘could not care less’ whether the woman was not consenting: we have seen that such men can be convicted of rape in cases where they achieve penetration, but there is a problem in convicting them of attempted rape where they fail to achieve penetration but clearly intended to do so.",2
1111,The problem is that  conviction for an attempted crime requires an intent to commit the full offence whereas the ‘reckless’ attempted rapist intends to have sexual intercourse but is merely reckless the woman's non-consent.,2
1112,"The strong argument classifying such offences as attempted rape merely indecent assault has now been recognized by the Law Commission's draft Criminal Code, and the Court of Appeal has recently found its way to this conclusion by ‘interpreting’ the Criminal Attempts Act 1981.",2
1113,(c) Indecent Assault,2
1114,"In English law the offence of indecent assault is charged for all forms of sexual assault rape, buggery, and attempts to commit those crimes.",2
1115,"Until 1985 the maximum penalty for indecent assault on a female was two years' imprisonment, compared with ten years for indecent assault on a male — a legacy of the horror with which homosexuality was viewed, and of the undervaluing of female sexual and physical autonomy — but the maximum penalty for both forms of indecent assault is now ten years.",2
1116,"This is a far more realistic maximum for cases involving forced oral sex and other indignities, but the real question is whether such serious forms of sexual assault should be classified differently.",2
1117,"they ‘share’ the offence of indecent assault with many minor forms of misconduct, giving an unwanted kiss or fondling clothes being worn by someone else, for which the penalty is likely to be a long way down the scale.",2
1118,"This suggests that there is a strong argument for having two grades of indecent assault in English law, or for moving some of the more serious forms of the crime (forced fellatio or cunnilingus) into a broadened crime of rape or ‘serious sexual assault’.",2
1119,"Most of the technical legal controversy has concerned not the more serious varieties of indecent assault but the more ambiguous forms, where the element of indecency is used to separate the sexual offence from the non-sexual.",2
1120,In (1988) the House of Lords upheld the conviction of a man who had spanked a young girl several times on the seat of her shorts.,2
1121,"The House distinguished, in effect, three types of case.",2
1122,"First, where the conduct would not be thought indecent by any right-minded observer, indecent assault  could not be committed.",2
1123,"Second, where right-minded observers would agree that the conduct was indecent, that would be an indecent assault.",2
1124,"In a third class of cases, where the right-minded observer would be unsure, the court would look at the defendant's motive and, only if that was indecent, would the offence be made out.",2
1125,"One result of this is that much will turn on the court's initial characterization of the incident, using the ‘right-minded person’ test.",2
1126,"That test is vague, but could it be improved upon in this context?",2
1127,Is it possible to predetermine the types of conduct regarded as indecent?,2
1128,"Should the defendant's motive be so crucial in cases where the act is not obviously indecent, in the sense that ‘right-minded persons’ would not unhesitatingly classify it as such?",2
1129,"(One might argue against the concept of ‘right-minded persons’, which moves a statistical concept ‘most people’ or ‘the ordinary citizen’and seems to seek a moral plane which is ‘right-minded’, a question-begging approach in this context.)",2
1130,Does it matter if a person derives some kind of sexual satisfaction from an act which most people or ‘right-minded persons’ would not regard as indecent?,2
1131,"There is no parallel here with punishment for attempts and other inchoate offences, because there is no proof that the defendant was aiming to do something harmful: the harmfulness of the action is supposedly constituted by the indecent motive, not by anything actually done, or about to be done, to the victim.",2
1132,The two main issues in the crime of indecent assault are therefore: whether the crime ought to be divided into two grades the more serious forms of sexual assault can be labelled separately; and how to draw the line between indecent and non-indecent contact with another.,2
1133,"There is no indecent assault where the other party consents to the conduct, and the fault element for the crime includes knowledge or recklessness whether the other party is consenting.",2
1134,"Here, as with rape, it seems sufficient to show that D ‘could not care less’ whether the other party was not consenting.",2
1135,"However, a person under the age of 16 cannot give valid consent.",2
1136,"Thus, if a woman were to have sexual intercourse with a boy under 16, this would be the offence of indecent assault by the woman the boy consented to, or instigated, the act.",2
1137,"This restriction on consent is designed for the protection of the young, to which we will now turn.",2
1138,(d) Sexual Intercourse with Girls under 16,2
1139,A male commits an offence if he has sexual intercourse with a girl under 16.,2
1140,"she consents in fact, this has no effect in law and the offence is still committed.",2
1141,"If the girl is under 13, the maximum penalty is life imprisonment, since a girl of 12 or under cannot have sufficient knowledge of the consequences of sex, or sufficient maturity of judgment to take decisions on those consequences.",2
1142,"Where the girl is aged 13 to 15, the maximum penalty is two years.",2
1143,There is a defence for a young man under 24 who has not previously been charged with a similar offence and who believes that the girl is 16 years old.,2
1144,"In practice, the vast majority of reported offences of unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl of 16 involve young men of a similar age or a few years older, and the general trend is to administer a formal caution to such persons to prosecute them.",2
1145,"Prosecution is thus reserved for the cases in which some unfair advantage has been taken of the girl, particularly where the girl is under 13 (when lack of proper understanding is assumed), where the man is considerably older than the girl, where the man held some position of trust the girl, and where there is some element of deception involved.",2
1146,The law does not specify any of these elements: everything is left to prosecutorial discretion.,2
1147,"The Criminal Law Revision Committee took the view that, if the law did try to restrict the offence in this way, it would inevitably legalize some cases which should remain the law.",2
1148,Thus the law continues to sacrifice the principle of maximum certainty (see Chapter 3.3 (i)) to the supposed dictates of practicality.,2
1149,"The law is framed widely, in the expectation that it will be enforced selectively.",2
1150,"In one particular sphere, however, other legal systems seem to disagree with the practicality argument: namely, cases of sexual intercourse with a girl under 16 committed by a person in a position of trust towards her.",2
1151,"Many countries have an offence of ‘abuse of authority’ to differentiate these crimes, the principle of fair labelling (Chapter 3.3 (1)), but anxieties about the problem of listing the types of authority (should it include persons undertaking voluntary responsibility, choirmasters and youth-club leaders?) have led to the continuation of the pragmatic all-encompassing provisions in England and Wales.",2
1152,There are sharp divisions about the fault element for the offence of unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under 16.,2
1153,"The limited ‘defence’ of mistake about the girl's age, available to young men under 24, was explained above, and the reason for creating such a limited ‘defence’is that it has been held that the crime does not require any fault element the girl's age.",2
1154,"For many years the decision in (1875), in effect that the man is strictly liable when the girl is under 16, has been paraded by academic lawyers as the acme of injustice.",2
1155,"The decision may certainly be said to be the recent trend, that a defendant should be judged on the facts as he believes them to be; and this led the Criminal Law Revision Committee to recommend that the rules should be harmonized and that the prosecution should prove that the man realized that the girl was under 16.",2
1156,", one must question whether consistency is the highest value here.",2
1157,"Critics argue that the whole point of this offence is to provide protection for young girls, and that this will be undermined if it is open to men to seek an acquittal on the ground that the girl looked 16.",2
1158,"Without directly embracing the ‘protection’ element in this argument, it can be suggested that there should he a duty on the man to ask the girl about her age before entering into sexual relations, the answers may be untruthful in some cases.",2
1159,(e) Other Rules against Exploitation of the Vulnerable,2
1160,Mention might be made of four other special rules relating to the involvement of vulnerable persons in sexual activity.,2
1161,"The rule of strict liability age, which applies equally to indecent assault, has already been noticed.",2
1162,"Another judge-made rule is that in (1894), which provides that a person cannot be convicted as a party to an offence if the offence was created for the protection of such persons.",2
1163,"Thus, in cases where a young girl or young boy of 15 leads an adult into sexual activity, the youth cannot be convicted as a party to either unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under 16 or indecent assault (as the case may be).",2
1164,The adult commits the offence; the law imposes on him or her the duty to resist whatever temptation is provided by the under-age person.,2
1165,"Among the specific offences designed to protect the vulnerable, there are various offences of sexual relations with mentally handicapped persons.",2
1166,"There is a crime of gross indecency with or towards a child under 14, which may be committed there is no indecent assault on the child by the adult — by inviting the child to touch the genitalia of the adult, .",2
1167,"However, there seems little reason for limiting the offence to cases involving children under 14 when the general age of consent to sexual activity stands at 16.",2
1168,And it is an offence for a man to commit gross indecency with another man: this offence usually concerns mutual masturbation or oral sex between two males (there is no equivalent offence between females).,2
1169,"The reason for discussing it here is that, under the Sexual Offences Act 1967, this offence is not committed where the act is done , between consenting males, both aged 21 or over.",2
1170,This means that it is regarded as criminal for a man of 21 to commit this offence with a consenting male under 21.,2
1171,"The age of 21 seems exceptionally high, since a person has the right to vote at 18 and the age of consent for other sexual conduct is 16.",2
1172,"Logic suggests that 16 should be the age of consent for this conduct, too, but the CLRC took the view that young men of 16 and 17 need protection from this kind of behaviour, whereas they do not from other kinds of sexual contact.",2
1173,"The anomaly is increased by the fact that, under the present law, two young men under 21 who consensually commit ‘gross indecency’ are both liable to conviction for the offence: the rule in is inapplicable here, but the maximum penalty is two years' imprisonment where the offender is under 21, compared with five years where he is over 21.",2
1174,8.7 INCEST,2
1175,"A parent or grandparent who has sexual contact with a child or grandchild may well be guilty of one of the offences already considered — rape, if there is sexual intercourse without consent; indecent assault, if there is sexual contact with a child under 16; and even gross indecency with or towards a child, if the child is under 14.",2
1176,"These other offences do not cover all eventualities, and, moreover, it may be argued with some force that child sexual abuse at home  ought to be labelled separately.",2
1177,"It is not merely a sexual offence, but one of the deepest breaches of trust which can take place in a family-based society.",2
1178,"The home ought to be a safe haven, the place where people go to get fear and violence, and it is this fundamental feeling of safety which can be destroyed by child sexual abuse.",2
1179,Incest was introduced into English law as a distinct offence by the Punishment of Incest Act 1908.,2
1180,"Although the eugenic risk (that the child of an incestuous relationship between father — daughter or brother — sister will have congenital defects) was known at the time and was probably a factor, most of the arguments of the reformers were based on the protection of children from sexual exploitation.",2
1181,"Those arguments have great force today, as increasing evidence of child sexual abuse within the family comes to that power to lead a daughter into sexual activity from a relatively early age.",2
1182,"All kinds of pressure may be exerted on the child to keep quiet about the behaviour, with sometimes disastrous effects on his or her emotional development.",2
1183,"Indeed, the primacy of this anti-exploitation rationale over eugenic reasons makes it desirable to extend the offence to cover adopted children blood-relationships.",2
1184,"The offence of incest is committed by a man who has sexual intercourse with a person whom he knows to be his granddaughter, daughter, sister or mother, and by a woman aged 16 or over who permits her grandfather, father, brother, or son to have sexual intercourse with her.",2
1185,"The first thing to notice about this definition is that, like the offence of rape, it is restricted to ‘sexual intercourse’.",2
1186,"In the context of incest this is even less defensible — first, because eugenic reasons provide the main grounds for criminalization; and second because the primary rationale of punishing the sexual exploitation of children within the family applies no less to other serious sexual behaviour, oral and anal sex.",2
1187,Surely the offence of incest should cover all cases of vaginal or anal penetration or penetration involving the penis.,2
1188,Another feature of the offence is that it applies the ages of the parties (a woman cannot commit the offence of ‘permitting’ intercourse unless she is aged 16 or over).,2
1189,"Thus the crime of incest covers sexual relations by mature adults, in situations where the rationale of punishing exploitation of the young should apply.",2
1190,"One question, therefore, is whether the age should be reduced to 16, which is the general age of consent for sexual activity.",2
1191,"There might appear to be an argument consistency here, but it is surely eclipsed by the need to recognize that many children remain dependent on their parents until they are 18.",2
1192,"Indeed, the CLRC recommended that the age should be no lower than 21.",2
1193,"Another issue is whether brother — sister incest should remain criminal where both parties are aged 18 or over: when sentencing, the courts treat this as a much less serious form of the offence than father — daughter incest, and a majority of the CLRC accepted that brother — sister incest should cease to be an offence when both parties are aged 21 or over.",2
1194,"The reasoning behind this proposal seems to be that the two parties are adult, and any exploitation deriving from the family tie seems no more likely than in other adult relationships.",2
1195,"However, adulthood begins at 18 21, and we have an example of a desire to shield those aged under 21 which may actually lead to the penalization of some brothers and sisters of that age.",2
1196,8.8 PARAMETERS OF THE LAW ON SEXUAL ASSAULT,2
1197,It is evident from this survey of English law on sexual assault that the parameters are open to considerable argument.,2
1198,"Rules of antiquity (the definition of rape, and the marital exemption), of modernity (the definition of incest), and of recent creation (the doctrine of mistake in rape) are being called into question.",2
1199,"There can be little doubt that the administration of criminal justice has paid insufficient attention to problems of sexual abuse over the years, and recent improvements in police procedures and in services for victims are to be welcomed.",2
1200,"The difficult issue is how far this movement should be taken: changes which make it easier to convict men of sexual assault on women, or parents of the sexual abuse of children, cannot be welcomed unless one has a clear conception of the rights of defendants the rights of victims.",2
1201,It is one thing to maintain that victims of sexual assault have  in the past suffered oppressive questioning by the police and oppressive cross-examination in court.,2
1202,"It is quite another thing to suggest that it is therefore proper to place higher burdens of proof on defendants, and to restrict the presentation of the defence.",2
1203,Each of these proposals deserves careful examination from both points of view.,2
1204,The starting-point must be the empirical evidence of the effects of sexual assaults.,2
1205,"These are variable, , but in many cases there are severe psychological after-effects — trauma, fear, and mistrust — which deeply affect the victim's ability to lead a normal life for some time to come.",2
1206,"It is not suggested that each offence should be ranked the seriousness of its after-effects on the particular victim — although there is an argument for assuming that young victims will be particularly damaged by unwanted sexual experiences, and therefore for regarding such offences as more serious.",2
1207,"To transfer this judgment of seriousness into desirable legal responses is no easy matter, however, for two powerful reasons.",2
1208,"First, children might refrain from reporting or giving evidence if they know that a substantial prison sentence for a member of their family is the probable outcome.",2
1209,"Second, defendants might defend cases more vigorously, causing greater trauma to child witnesses, if substantial imprisonment is probable.",2
1210,"It can therefore be argued that, serious as the offence usually is, a policy of non-custodial treatment might be preferable the effects on child victims.",2
1211,"So far as ranking the relative seriousness of sexual assaults is concerned, however, full account should be taken of the psychological effects of such offences.",2
1212,"Above all, one must avoid any tendency to equate the degree of harm with the degree of physical injury in a particular case, since the psychological harm may be far more severe.",2
1213,"This chapter has dealt chiefly with the non-consensual offences, and this is important, because it is the absence of consent which is the crucial factor in many cases of sexual assault.",2
1214,"Such offences attack the principle of freedom of choice in sexual matters, and this, together with the punishment of those who exploit the young, the mentally handicapped, and those for whom they have responsibility, should form the bedrock of the scheme of offences.",2
1215,"This is not the place to embark upon detailed discussion of possible schemes for grading sexual assaults, but questions have been raised about the exclusion from the English offence of rape of oral and anal intercourse and penetration of the vagina by other objects.",2
1216,There is evidence to suggest that victims of these other forms of serious sexual assault regard them as no less serious than rape (narrowly defined).,2
1217,"There is a strong argument for extending the offence of rape to cover these other sexual indignities, or for restructuring the law there are degrees of sexual assault.",2
1218,"The sentencing decision in (1986) marks out some of the more serious varieties of sexual assault, and this could be used as a basis for introducing a new scheme of three or four graded offences: there are precedents for this in other countries.",2
1219,"One approach would be to have first-degree sexual assault defined to include penetration involving the penis, vagina, or anus, together with the threat or infliction of grievous bodily harm; then a second-degree offence of the same nature involving a threat or infliction of actual bodily harm; and then a third-degree offence covering all other sexual assaults involving penetration, and a fourth offence to cover indecent assaults not involving penetration.",2
1220,"The CLRC did give serious consideration to dividing indecent assault into two grades, so the idea of grading is not entirely alien to England.",2
1221,"One argument sometimes raised against it is that it would lead to plea-bargaining, and thus to offenders escaping with lesser convictions and lesser sentences.",2
1222,"The fact is that this is a prominent feature of the existing law, in which there are only two major offences (rape and indecent assault) and in which some 42 of those charged with rape have a plea of guilty to indecent assault accepted by the court.",2
1223,"A more refined gradation of offences could not be worse in this respect, and might improve the fairness of the labels and sentences imposed on sexual offenders.",2
1224,"One other consequence of a fresh gradation of sexual offences might be that they would cease to be gender-specific: there are some strange inconsistencies in the law , and it is not difficult to draft offences which might be committed by males or females against males or females.",2
1225,One feature of the discussion in this chapter has been to challenge the use of the concepts of consistency and ‘inexorable logic’ as  unanswerable standards of appraisal of the law.,2
1226,"This is not to suggest that consistency is an unworthy value: the argument is rather that there is a need to decide upon the categories to which the argument of consistency is being applied, and above all to recognize that simple resort to the allegation of inconsistency might serve to conceal the conflict between a number of social interests or principles.",2
1227,"One example is the doctrine of mistake in rape: it might appear to be ‘inexorable logic’ that if the offence of rape is only committed where D knew that the woman was not consenting or was reckless her non-consent, a mistaken belief that she was consenting would lead to an acquittal.",2
1228,"The inexorable logic does not, however, establish that the result is morally or socially desirable.",2
1229,"There is a powerful argument that as far as sexual behaviour is concerned, an area in which consent makes the difference between gross violation and shared pleasure, and in which physical proximity makes it relatively easy to ask about consent, the law should in effect impose a duty to enquire.",2
1230,This would be done by limiting exculpatory mistakes to those based on reasonable grounds.,2
1231,It would partly alter the definition of rape or serious sexual assault; it would introduce an element of negligence liability; and it would also make D liable for an omission.,2
1232,"But all those changes could be justified respect for the principle of freedom of choice in sexual matters, particularly where the enquiry is so straightforward.",2
1233,"A similar argument could be mounted mistakes about age in the offences against girls and boys under 16: the basic principle of fairness to defendants underpins the subjective requirement of fault, but there is also the social policy against exploitation of the young and vulnerable.",2
1234,"This social policy might support a duty to enquire about age wherever there might be room for doubt, and the ease of compliance (the inevitable physical proximity of the parties) again favours the requirement.",2
1235,"In practice, there might be situations of doubt; a man might claim that there was nothing to alert him to the girl's age (e.g. a 15-year-old girl, who looks much older, soliciting in a street with other prostitutes).",2
1236,"Moreover, if the criminal law is to impose duties of these kinds, it should publicize them widely, to ensure compliance with the principle of legality.",2
1237,"The point of this argument is not to maintain that there would be no practical problems, but to demonstrate that there are weighty issues of principle on both sides.",2
1238,Appeal to ‘inexorable logic’ or consistency cannot conclude the argument: it over-simplifies the issues.,2
1239,"One policy, already mentioned, which should continue to shape  the law of sexual offences is the criminalization of those who exploit the young and vulnerable.",2
1240,"This is achieved through special offences and through rules invalidating apparent consent given by those under 16, and it is supported by the rule against convicting a participant who falls within the class protected by the offence concerned.",2
1241,"The relevant ages of consent in English law vary: 16 seems to be the general age, but the offence of gross indecency with or towards children only applies where the child is under 14, and the age of consent for homosexual offences is 21 and the recommendation is to lower it only to 18.",2
1242,", consistency is a proper starting-point for critical appraisal, but it is important to examine any special circumstances attendant on particular offences.",2
1243,", is there any substance in the claim that young men of 16 and 17 are more vulnerable, socially and psychologically, than young women of a similar age?",2
1244,"Certainly there appears to be some sense in restricting any changes in the law of incest it continues to be an offence for a parent or grandparent to have sexual relations with a child aged 16 or 17, because children of that age are often dependent and living at home, and so the conditions for exploitation are still present at that age.",2
1245,", the policy of using the law against those who indulge in sexual exploitation of the vulnerable may conflict with the ‘logic’ of overall consistency in age-limits, and this conflict must be acknowledged and confronted.",2
1,a Non-punitive Paradigm of Probation Practice: Some Sobering Thoughts L.R. SINGER,3
2,Lawrence Singer is an Assistant Chief Probation Officer with Merseyside Probation Service.,3
3,Beforehand he worked as a probation officer for Berkshire Probation Service and later as a research officer for Somerset Probation Service where he undertook the research reported here.,3
4,"The paradigm which is described originates from doctoral research into generic probation practice and has been presented in a book (1989, Gower).",3
5,SUMMARY,3
6,The Government White Paper proposes a radical change for probation practice.,3
7,Henceforth probation work will be an alternative to punishment but an alternative form of punishment.,3
8,This article challenges the conceptual and practical appropriateness of applying the notion of punishment to the probation context.,3
9,"Probation officers, it is argued, are concerned with establishing rules for probationers and not inflicting pain on them.",3
10,An alternative non-punitive paradigm of probation practice is described.,3
11,"The paradigm is based on the joint supervisory aims of support and surveillance which are implemented through the methods of counselling, assisting, directing, and monitoring.",3
12,"To illustrate the paradigm, reference is made to an alcohol education course developed for offenders in trouble through drink.",3
13,The efficacy of the alcohol project and the non-punitive paradigm is demonstrated by the results reported from a three year evaluation study covering 152 offenders.,3
14,"The article concludes with an affirmation of the disciplined but non-punitive character of current probation work and argues that, to successfully protect the public and reintegrate offenders into the community, the probation officer's employment of established social work knowledge, skills, and values is a strength not a weakness.",3
15,"The aim of this article is to challenge the assertion contained in the White Paper (Home Office, 1990a) that probation practice can be conceived of as a form of punishment in the community.",3
16,Issue will be taken with the appropriateness of applying the concept of punishment to the probation context through reference to a demanding and successful probation project concerned   with offenders in trouble through drink.,3
17,"In describing the project, a non-punitive model for understanding probation practice will be developed.",3
18,"This non-punitive paradigm will provide a framework for contrasting the efficacy of current practice with future plans inappropriately to transform probation work into ‘a new approach to punishment in the community’(p. 18, para. 4.3).",3
19,The punitive approach anticipated for the Probation Service in the White Paper is underpinned by a definition of punishment that resides ‘in the restrictions on liberty and in the enforcement of the orders’.,3
20,"The White Paper goes on to emphasize: ‘It is the loss of liberty involved in carrying out the terms of the order the activities carried out during the order which is the punishment’(p. 18, para. 4.4).",3
21,"Notwithstanding the popular appeal and political capital to be derived from such a humane-sounding statement, this definition is nevertheless at variance with the traditional understanding of the meaning of punishment.",3
22,"Discourses on punishment and dictionary definitions of the term clearly specify the central feature of punishment as being the infliction of pain the loss of liberty (Hudson, 1987).",3
23,The conceptual and practical implications of this discrepancy will be examined in the third and final section of this article.,3
24,"Beforehand, however, consideration will be given first to the probation project and second to its evaluation.",3
25,In these sections punishment will be understood to mean the infliction of pain and the review of the project will seek to demonstrate that the probation practice described is not only more demanding but also more effective than this traditional understanding of punishment.,3
26,"At a time when the Home Secretary is inviting the Probation Service to ‘move centre stage in the Criminal Justice System’(NACRO, 1990, p. 17) it may seem misguided and unnecessarily pedantic to take issue with the White Paper's notion of punishment.",3
27,Punishment is just a word after all: nothing more than convenient political rhetoric meriting only lip-service from probation managers and practitioners poised at the ‘window of opportunity’.,3
28,"However, this fails to acknowledge a fundamental axiom of social work practice; namely that language not only reflects but also shapes social reality.",3
29,"As Davies (1981) has pointed out, speech is the basic tool of the social worker.",3
30,"What we say influences what we think and in turn, what we do.",3
31,If punishment is assimilated into the probation glossary it will inevitably influence the sort of practice the Service undertakes.,3
32,"In the sections to follow the stark question is therefore put ‘Is the Probation Service in the business of inflicting pain?’ and the answer which unfolds may be summarized ‘No, because it neither aspires nor wishes to!’",3
33,THE PROJECT: MORE DEMANDING THAN PUNISHMENT,3
34,Government concern about the problem of drink-related offending is as old as the Probation Service.,3
35,"Indeed, as Bochel (1976) has shown, the establishment of a Probation Service in England and Wales was inextricably linked with work undertaken with offenders in trouble through drink.",3
36,Almost a century later the new approach to punishment in the community outlined by the White Paper presents alcohol misuse as a key problem requiring community-based intervention.,3
37,"‘Alcohol’, the White Paper states, ‘is implicated in a wide variety of crimes, drunken driving, offences of public disorder and domestic violence’(p. 21, para. 4. 14).",3
38,In describing its vision of effective supervision the White Paper goes on to note:,3
39,offenders take part in alcohol education programmes they can learn to drink sensibly.,3
40,"They learn about the relative strength of different drinks, the amount which is safe to consume, and the pitfalls to avoid (e.g. competitive drinking and buying ‘rounds’)(p. 37, para. 7.11).",3
41,"As a summary of alcohol education programmes, this is something of a simplification.",3
42,However it does provide a useful introduction to the origins of the Alcohol Education Course reported here.,3
43,"Furthermore, it highlights the suitability of referring to this type of project for testing out the appropriateness of applying the notion of punishment to probation practice.",3
44,"In 1985 the management of Somerset Probation Service was faced with the fact that nearly one in three of the offenders supervised in their area were either known to be or suspected of misusing alcohol (Singer, 1985).",3
45,"Aware of practitioners' frustration in not being able to work effectively with these problematic clients, Probation management, in partnership with the voluntary sector, determined to develop an Alcohol Education Course (AEC).",3
46,"By 1986, when social inquiry report monitoring information covering 1,257 offenders indicated that the problem of drink-related offending was virtually as great for pre- post-sentence clients, , alcohol was cited as a pre-offence problem in twenty-nine of cases, a specialist project worker had been appointed.",3
47,Towards the end of 1986 an AEC was launched and has been running ever since.,3
48,The aim of the course is to educate offenders about alcohol to facilitate a lasting change in their subsequent use of this drug.,3
49,"This aim is underpinned by three interrelated objectives and it is not without significance how they complement and serve to implement the White Paper's own trinity of ‘aims of supervision’, , protection of  the public, prevention of reoffending and successful reintegration of the offender in the community (p. 35, para. 7.3).",3
50,These were:,3
51,1.,3
52,To increase knowledge about alcohol future alcohol use can be more informed and therefore more prudent.,3
53,2.,3
54,To instil or reinforce responsible drinking attitudes and behaviour.,3
55,3.,3
56,"To encourage the maintenance of, or, where appropriate, a reduction to a personally and socially safe level of alcohol unit intake.",3
57,"To meet these objectives the AEC has a structured programme involving group and individual contact, , six group sessions sandwiched between one-to-one interviews held immediately before and after the group .",3
58,"The initial one-to-one meeting, held with one of the two group leaders, serves to clarify what participants can expect from the course and what is expected of them.",3
59,A standard contract which covers conditions of attendance and an agreement to complete various assignments between group sessions is signed by each participant.,3
60,"The final interview entails a personalized review of the course, the formulation of a follow-up plan to be undertaken with the offender's supervising officer.",3
61,"The course employs a variety of materials and techniques including the use of checklists, magazine and newspaper clippings, quizzes, videos, brainstorm exercises, discussions, drink diaries, and role plays (Menary, 1986).",3
62,The AEC is primarily intended for young adults a probation order with a special condition of attendance (Schedule 11 4A(II) Criminal Justice Act 1982) and reflects the fact that most Somerset offenders in trouble through drink commit serious offences and/or possess a substantial number of previous convictions.,3
63,", they are seriously at risk of committing further offences and becoming trapped in the revolving door of custody.",3
64,The development of the Somerset AEC both accords with and constitutes a practical example of the Home Office's recent guidance to sentencers:,3
65,In recent years the probation service has devoted increasing resources to supervising the more serious and persistent offenders.,3
66,"Probation orders which are combined with constructive, disciplined and effective programmes of supervision are increasingly being used for offenders who stand to receive custodial sentences (1990b, p. 35).",3
67,From the description of the AEC already given the demanding and disciplined nature of the course can be appreciated.,3
68,"However, the course is not punitive; it is not concerned with the infliction of pain.",3
69,"Instead, it is concerned with the establishment of rules.",3
70,This is plainly evident from the section of the contract signed by each participant where what is expected of them is spelt out:,3
71,"You will be expected to keep a drink diary throughout the course, and make  attempts at reducing the amount you drink if it is greater than accepted healthy drinking levels.",3
72,You must be willing to be helped and help others — your experiences will be useful to other group members.,3
73,"You must attend 8 sessions (these will consist of: an introductory session, six group sessions and a final assessment interview).",3
74,You must not drink before the session.,3
75,You must be on time — lateness will count as an absence.,3
76,"Unlike the prison inmate, AEC participants cannot sit back and passively do their time.",3
77,"Probation practice is not, however, solely concerned with the establishment of rules.",3
78,"As has been demonstrated elsewhere the generic probation setting (Singer, 1989), the supervision of offenders involves two overarching aims: namely support and surveillance.",3
79,Support refers to anything which is said or done to help the offender solve or mitigate their personal or social problems: surveillance to anything which is said or done to induce the offender to conform to socially acceptable standards of behaviour.,3
80,These aims are implemented through the practice of four distinguishable but related methods.,3
81,"support, there is counselling and assisting: surveillance, there is directing and monitoring.",3
82,Each of these four methods are employed during the eight sessions.,3
83,"Although summarized as an alcohol course, the sessions are not just concerned with giving information but also with enabling participants to make practical use of it.",3
84,"In the first group session the counselling method is registered in the course tutor's notes (Menary, 1986) by the explanation: ‘This session aims to get participants to consider the subject of alcohol in ways they had not thought of in the past’(p. 3).",3
85,During this session the importance of monitoring is also emphasized:,3
86,"Drinks exercises introduce the notion of measurement, concentration of alcohol content; information which will be necessary to carry out the recording of alcohol consumption throughout the duration of the course (p. 3).",3
87,"In the fifth group session entitled ‘Focus on the Individual’, the counselling and the monitoring combine with the directing and assisting methods.",3
88,At the start of the session the tutor's notes make clear that directing extends beyond enforcing the conditions of attendance:,3
89,This session allows for an in depth examination of the drinking diaries over the last five weeks — identifying the risky circumstances or situations….,3
90,The aim at the end of the session is to encourage participants to make rules for their future drinking which will lead to a lessening of identified problems (p. 4).,3
91,"Similarly, the assisting extends beyond simply providing handouts of useful information:",3
92,It is important that participants are provided with the skills to reduce their drinking levels or handle more effectively ‘pub centred’ problems.,3
93,"The use of role play, incorporating previously discussed difficulties (i.e. homework assignment session 4) in ‘real’ or set up situations provides an opportunity for testing these skills.",3
94,Probably the best illustration of the assisting method in action during the course comes in the fifth session when Somerset practitioners take the logic of working with the problem in the community to its ultimate conclusion.,3
95,"In the second half of the session, course leaders sponsor participants to an evening at the pub for the purpose of practising drinking skills and purchasing non-alcoholic drinks.",3
96,"The counselling, assisting, directing, and monitoring on the AEC give substance to the aims of support and surveillance and provide the basis for establishing a model of probation practice.",3
97,Punishment has no place in this model.,3
98,Instead the AEC can best be understood as an example of a non-punitive paradigm of probation practice.,3
99,"Twenty years ago the Advisory Council on the Penal System observed that notions of punitiveness do not accord with ‘the British concept of probation as an alternative to, a suspension of, punishment’(quoted in Bochel, 1976, p. 238).",3
100,Twenty years later the AEC demonstrates that this remains no less true now than it was then.,3
101,But does the AEC work?,3
102,THE EVALUATION: MORE EFFECTIVE THAN PUNISHMENT,3
103,"Home Office statistics, probation practice is more efficient and no less effective than imprisonment.",3
104,"At 1988/89 rates (Home Office, 1990b, p. 110), it cost on average £288 per week to keep an offender in custody, compared with £19 per week to supervise an offender on probation; yet the Home Office acknowledge: ‘It is hard to show any effect that one type of sentence is more likely than any other to reduce the likelihood of reoffending, which is high for all’(p. 7).",3
105,"If anything can be shown, it would appear that probation is more effective than prison in reducing the risk of further offending.",3
106,"In a review of reconviction rates, , a Home Office report concluded: ‘Those given probation orders were therefore less likely to be reconvicted within two years of being given probation than those released from custody’(Home Office, 1986, p. 5).",3
107,"Methodological objections could be made to comparing the two groups the different periods of time monitored, , for prisoners the period of time refers to after the sentence has been served whereas for probationers it is after the sentence has been imposed.",3
108,"Moreover, it could be argued that prisoners are more at risk of further offences than probationers , first, their commission of relatively more serious offences, and second, their more extensive and therefore more entrenched criminal careers.",3
109,This may be so for the population of probationers generally but does not apply to the AEC sample.,3
110,"As noted earlier, the AEC was designed for offenders at risk of further offending and/or custody.",3
111,Between 1986 and 1988 152 offenders undertook the AEC while simultaneously being monitored to assess the impact of the course upon them.,3
112,"As a sample of offenders, the course participants have more prisoners than probationers.",3
113,In Table 1 below a comparison of the offences committed by the sample and those committed by persons commencing probation or entering custody nationally is given.,3
114,"Whereas for theft and fraud type offences there were almost twice as many commencing probation nationally as amongst the AEC participants, the reverse was true for violence, burglary and criminal damage type offences.",3
115,The similarity between the AEC participants and offenders entering custody — persons commencing probation nationally — is clearly shown by the identical proportions each group recorded for violent offences.,3
116,"Furthermore, the greater proportion of other indictable offences for the AEC sample, compared with probationers nationally, reflected the large number of drink-driving offenders, , 25.",3
117,"Given this array of serious offences committed by the AEC sample it is not surprising that the average number of previous   convictions was seven, with only 10 having no previous convictions compared with 28 who had ten or more.",3
118,In this connection it is relevant to note that 84 of the sample had consumed alcohol the commission of their current offences and three four of the convictions for previous offences had been drink-related.,3
119,The possibility that the sample's previous convictions simply reflected persistent petty offending can be discounted because over a third had already received a custodial sentence (37 ); a further fifth community service (20 ); and nearly another fifth a probation or supervision order (17 ).,3
120,"Most of the sample were male (94 ), aged between seventeen and twenty-four (61 ) and the risk of further offending and custody is highlighted by the fact that over half of the sample had committed an offence within a year of the current offence.",3
121,"In Somerset the management of the Probation Service has reached an agreement with the local and neighbouring courts that Schedule 11 probation orders, , orders containing day centre or specified activity requirements, are operated as a direct alternative to custody.",3
122,"In this light the at-risk status of the sample is further indicated by the fact that 91 of the sample were Schedule 11, with only six being on ordinary probation and three on statutory licence following release from custody, , parole and youth custody licence.",3
123,"The large proportion of schedule 11 cases in the AEC sample contrasts dramatically with the proportion commencing probation nationally in 1988, , 63 of the AEC's probationers were a day centre requirement compared with only six nationally; similarly, 31 of the AEC probationers were a specified activity requirement compared with only six nationally (Home Office, 1990c, p. 46).",3
124,"The more highly convicted and at-risk profile of the AEC sample was also reflected by the fact that whereas nationally as many as 80 of the persons commencing probation in 1988 had no additional requirements made to their probation orders, only six of the probationers undertaking the AEC received this traditional type of probation order from the courts.",3
125,The evaluation of the AEC was based upon a comprehensive assessment of the extent to which the course was able to achieve its stated objectives.,3
126,"This involved the collection and analysis of five different types of information: an alcohol knowledge test, a drink profile questionnaire, a drink diary, a consumer questionnaire and reconviction rate statistics.",3
127,"The nature of the method, its relation to course objectives and the results obtained are described below.",3
128,"As will gradually become evident, the AEC has proven itself to be an unambiguous success.",3
129,ALCOHOL KNOWLEDGE TEST,3
130,The alcohol knowledge test (AKT) is a twenty item multiple choice test of alcohol knowledge.,3
131,"Each question, like the course overall, is practical in focus and concerned with information about the relative strength of different alcoholic drinks, detoxification times, legal limits and medical effects.",3
132,The purpose of the test is to provide an objective basis for assessing the nature and extent of participants' alcohol knowledge before and after doing the course.,3
133,"Accordingly, the AKT was administered during the first and last of the group sessions and constituted a straightforward method for evaluating the success of the first course objective: specifically, to increase participants' alcohol knowledge future alcohol use can be more informed and therefore more prudent.",3
134,It will probably not surprise the reader to learn that at the outset of the course serious gaps in participants' knowledge were identified.,3
135,", over half of the participants (56 ) did not know how many beers they could drink before reaching the legal limit for driving and well over two-thirds of them knew neither how long it took for alcohol to be burned up by the body (71 ) nor what, if anything, was an effective way of sobering up (71 ).",3
136,"However, by the conclusion of the course over three-quarters of the sample knew the beer equivalent to the legal limit (77 ); the correct detoxification time (78 ); and the fact that there is no effective way to accelerate the detoxification process (79 )— including a cold shower or a cup of strong coffee!",3
137,"When the sample's average score twenty was calculated, it revealed an increase from 9.5 to 14.3 twenty.",3
138,"This means that there was an overall increase in the participants' alcohol knowledge between the start and the finish of the course of 50.5 : not abstract knowledge, but knowledge that is relevant to drinking with associates in the pub or elsewhere.",3
139,"To test whether each of the participants' before and after scores were simply a fluke occurrence, as distinct from a genuine increase in alcohol knowledge, a Wilcoxon Matched Pairs Test was undertaken using SPSS and the result proved statistically significant, , Z= -10. 1839, 2-tailed, P=0.0000.",3
140,DRINK PROFILE QUESTIONNAIRE,3
141,"It does not necessarily follow that knowing more about alcohol will automatically result in more responsible drinking attitudes and behaviour, , the second course objective.",3
142,"Participants could, , attempt to make their attitudes consonant with their recently acquired knowledge only to find themselves unable to break from their  established pattern of behaviour (Festinger, 1957).",3
143,To measure the extent to which the AEC was able to successfully anticipate and overcome this potential problem a drink profile questionnaire (DPQ) was devised and administered before and after the course.,3
144,The DPQ is a Likert-style schedule comprising five possible answers attracting a score of between one and five points for twenty-five different questions concerned with key aspects of drinking attitudes and behaviour.,3
145,"When completing the DPQ participants were told that, unlike the AKT, there were no right answers.",3
146,"Regarding attitudes, participants were invited to rank from strongly agree (five points) to strongly disagree (one point) their level of agreement with statements ‘To enjoy yourself, it is necessary to have something to drink’ and ‘If you limit the amount you drink, it spoils your enjoyment’.",3
147,"Regarding behaviour, participants were asked to indicate from always (five points) to never (one point) the frequency of instances occurring where, , they got drunk they did not intend to; their drinking left them short of cash; they drank to help themselves deal with a crisis; and they missed meals because they wanted to drink instead.",3
148,The participants' answers were scored and their grand totals then checked against where they fell on a continuum of five risk levels ranging from very low to very high.,3
149,"Whereas in the AKT an upward trend is indicative of success, the reverse is true for the DPQ, , the lowering of risk level represents a shift towards having instilled or reinforced responsible drinking attitudes and behaviour.",3
150,It was precisely this type of downward shift that was recorded.,3
151,Between the first and the second DPQ over three-quarters of the participants either reduced to (72 ) or remained at (six ) a medium or low level of risk.,3
152,"To assess whether this before — after difference was merely a fluke occurrence the Wilcoxon Test was undertaken and the result proved statistically significant, , Z=-7.7565, 2-tailed, P=0.0000.",3
153,"Bearing in mind the course leaders' concern to instil or reinforce responsible drinking attitudes and behaviour, it is worth noting that before the course 77 of the participants agreed with the statement ‘To enjoy yourself, it is necessary to have something to drink’; yet by the end of the course 88 disagreed with this attitude.",3
154,"Similarly, whereas over half of the sample (57 ) admitted to always or mostly continuing to drink they knew they were intoxicated, at the end of the course 60 said this rarely or never occurred.",3
155,DRINK DIARY,3
156,"The third objective of the AEC is to encourage the maintenance of, or, where appropriate, a reduction to a personally and socially safe level of alcohol unit intake.",3
157,"Determining how much is too much is debatable but authoritative (if somewhat tough) guidelines have been set by Alcohol Concern the Health Education Council and the medical professions (Alcohol Concern, 1986, p. 5).",3
158,"Three levels of alcohol consumption are specified: low, moderate, and high.",3
159,Males consuming over 36 units of alcohol a week and females consuming 22 units have a high level and are advised to cut down immediately.,3
160,AEC participants were required to keep a weekly drink diary after each of the group sessions to monitor their drinking levels.,3
161,"Although it must be acknowledged that there is a danger of deliberate under-recording, the emphasis placed by the course on the value and importance of being honest with oneself appears to have resolved this problem.",3
162,The non-punitive approach of the course is reflected in its policy neither to reward low scores nor to punish underscoring.,3
163,"This is because the aim of the exercise is to provide the participants with a practical tool for monitoring their drinking: if they want to cheat, they will only be cheating themselves.",3
164,In this connection the comments from two of the participants were typical.,3
165,The first time I went he got us to do a drink diary and I know I didn't tell the truth.,3
166,I put down less than I had been drinking.,3
167,I don't know why I did that.,3
168,"I thought ‘What's the other person going to put down, is he going to do the same?",3
169,Well I don't want to be seen drinking more than he is!’,3
170,"As the group went on I was being truthful, I put down what I was drinking.",3
171,"The two lads that were with me at the end, they were being truthful.",3
172,Theirs went down but mine went up.,3
173,"These drink diaries are excellent, brilliant way nobody cheats.",3
174,You're only cheating yourself when you cheat.,3
175,They were easy to do.,3
176,"Information from the drink diaries, based on a comparison of the averages for the first and the last three weeks of the course, revealed a shift from high to moderate drinking levels for males, , from 40 to 32 units per week.",3
177,The nine females who undertook the course remained within the high zone but nevertheless registered a reduction from an average of 39 units to 28 units per week.,3
178,"Overall, almost three-quarters of the participants either reduced their intake (61 ) or remained at the same level (11 ) between the first and the last three weeks of the course.",3
179,"Using the Wilcoxon test this downward trend was again found to be statistically significant, , Z= — 4.9595, 2 — tailed, P= 0–0000.",3
180,CONSUMER FEEDBACK,3
181,"After completing the AEC, participants were interviewed to provide them with an opportunity to reflect and comment on the course.",3
182,Interviews were conducted by the research officer or the alcohol project worker (the course leaders) to ensure confidentiality; and a semi-structured interview guide was used.,3
183,"The guide covered questions about the participants' expectations, experience and evaluation of the course.",3
184,The interview transcripts run to some 121 pages and can only be superficially summarized here.,3
185,"However, five points of direct relevance to the success of the course and the applicability of the non-punitive paradigm warrant a brief mention.",3
186,"First, all the responses made, only two participants stated that their attendance on the course had not been worthwhile and none said that the course should be discontinued.",3
187,"Second, the vast majority of participants were able to indicate the practical, as distinct from abstract, usefulness of the course.",3
188,drinking and driving :,3
189,"I've learnt , my job depends on me driving and it's made me realise how much I can drink, how much I can't drink, what I can drink and realising about road accidents.",3
190,The amount you drink does affect your driving quite considerably,3
191,"Third, different aspects of the course appeared to cater for different needs.",3
192,For some the counselling was particularly appreciated:,3
193,"more knowledge, it made you think more about what you were doing really.",3
194,For others it was the assistance that was especially useful:,3
195,"When we all went to the pub and some of them went up and got non-alcoholic drinks and that, and they all said they couldn't go into a pub and do that and they done it, no problem.",3
196,I think it was useful going to the pub.,3
197,"Fourth, many participants frankly admitted that they had very low expectations at the outset: specifically that the course was simply designed to punish them, which they would give the minimum amount of attention possible.",3
198,All agreed that this was not,3
199,Their experience as the following comments clearly demonstrate:,3
200,I thought they were out to get me to be honest with you.,3
201,I thought they were out to get me as a punishment.,3
202,But I don't think so now.,3
203,He was just telling us and you learn.,3
204,"You've gotta face it haven't you, you've gotta face it whatever.",3
205,"If you don't face anything, you don't get anywhere.",3
206,I was frightened.,3
207,I thought it was going to be worse than it was.,3
208,It was good once  it got going.,3
209,I didn't think we would have the opportunity to say things — we all got a chance to speak.,3
210,"I really thought it was going to be ‘You must not drink ever again' and ‘You naughty boy, you mustn't do it ever again' sort of thing.",3
211,"I had the idea that it was going to be ‘Do this, do that’ but it wasn't like that.",3
212,"Finally (and in direct accord with the non-punitive approach of the course), the emphasis upon participants by the end of the course making their own rules — them being made by others — was greatly appreciated.",3
213,"My rules are to cut down drinking, control my temper if I am drinking, not to drink in a such a large group and not to waste much money.",3
214,"It's a good idea, you should set yourself your own targets so you can know.",3
215,RECONVICTION RATE STATISTICS,3
216,Positive test results and favourable feedback might be sufficient evaluation criteria the Criminal Justice System but reconviction rates for probation practice must remain the acid test.,3
217,"Before and after course results are important indices of immediate impact, but did participants manage to keep trouble with the law twelve months after completing the course?",3
218,"the assistance of the statistics department of Avon and Somerset Police, it was possible to answer this question and provide a fifth and final indicator of success.",3
219,"the high risk profile of the participants, , an average of seven previous and often recent convictions (see above), 95 or 63 of the sample were not recorded as having committed further offences during the twelve month follow-up.",3
220,"In other words, almost two three of the participants had kept further trouble through drink.",3
221,As one participant observed:,3
222,"Yea, drinking's always got me into trouble in the past, I mean now I've thought about it, I've thought what a stupid idiot I'd be, so you know if it wasn't for the course, then I probably would have gone and done it again, you know, without a second thought.",3
223,"Without the benefit of the results from a random allocation study based on experimental and control groups, second thoughts about how much of the two three success rate can be directly attributed to the AEC are inevitable.",3
224,"However, Phillpotts and Lancucki's (1979) authoritative study for the Home Office on reconviction rates offers a basis for provisional optimism.",3
225,"In their six year follow-up study of 5,000 offenders convicted of standard list offences in January 1971, they reported that:",3
226,"Offenders who were reconvicted within the follow-up period were likely to have  their first reconviction fairly soon after sentence (or, for those given custodial sentences, after discharge).",3
227,"Offenders with a large number of previous convictions were not only more likely to be reconvicted but were reconvicted sooner than those with few previous convictions (1979, p. 41).",3
228,"What is of particular relevance to the AEC sample is Phillpott and Lancucki's finding that 53 of all male offenders with five or more preconvictions were reconvicted within a year (1979, p. 24).",3
229,If the AEC had made no difference to the male participants with five or more preconvictions we would expect over half of them to have been reconvicted.,3
230,"However, as might be anticipated from the progress registered earlier improvements regarding alcohol knowledge, attitudes and behaviour, 53 only 42 of the ‘five or more’ male offenders were reconvicted.",3
231,DISCIPLINE: MORE APPROPRIATE THAN PUNISHMENT,3
232,"The idea espoused in the White Paper that restrictions on liberty will become ‘the connecting thread in a range of community penalties custody’(p. 19, para. 4.5) is conceptually flawed for two basic reasons.",3
233,"First, if restriction on liberty is the defining feature of punishment, what are we to make of the experience of children who have to go to school and adults who have to work for a living?",3
234,Is liberty not being restricted both intention and effect?,3
235,", employers and teachers keep registers of attendance and prescribe supervise the activities of their employees/pupils, , restriction by intent.",3
236,"Moreover, children attending school and adults turning up for work inevitably have their liberty restricted: simply because the engagement in one activity necessarily restricts their opportunity to participate in other activities, , restriction by effect.",3
237,It is patently absurd to regard attendance at school or work as a punishment.,3
238,"Second, the notion of a continuum of restriction ranging from community penalties to custody — neat as it sounds — fails to acknowledge the unique and painful experience of imprisonment.",3
239,"As Sykes (1971) has shown, confinement to and within a prison entails a number of pains.",3
240,"These involve physical, financial, and psychological hardships including the loss of liberty, goods and services, heterosexual relationships, autonomy, security and life chances post-custody.",3
241,"Lest anyone doubt the validity of these observations in England and Wales, consider the following admission about a custodial sentence from the Home Office:",3
242,It is likely to affect an offender's personal or financial prospects.,3
243,"There is the possibility that serious hardship will be inflicted on the offender's family, particularly those responsible for the care of young children….",3
244,"On release from custody, it can be very difficult for the offender to be reintegrated into the community.",3
245,"Furthermore, tor the young or inexperienced offender, mixing with more sophisticated inmates may deepen his anti-social attitudes and increase his criminal skills (1990b, pp. 8–9).",3
246,Probation practice cannot legitimately be placed on this sort of continuum.,3
247,"The description and evaluation of the AEC clearly demonstrates that, in their particular sphere of constructive influence, probation officers, like employers and teachers, are concerned with the establishment of rules and not the infliction of pain.",3
248,"Put another way, it is discipline, not punishment, which constitutes the connecting thread running through the diverse range of probation practice.",3
249,This point was made by one commentator during the first review of the ‘Probation System’ at the beginning of this century: his comments remain pertinent for the Home Office in their current review at the end of the century.,3
250,"Probation…is a test or trial of the character of a convicted offender under suspension of judgment, that the court may determine if the probationer be fit to retain his or her place as a helpful member of society, or being unfit, must be deprived of his or her liberty as a menace to society.",3
251,It is established for the purpose of correction and oversight.,3
252,It is a conditional freedom.,3
253,"It recognises that the newer and better way to govern the law-breaker is not through the expiring system of the cell and the lash, but rather through the mind and the heart (Bridgwater, 1909, p. 9).",3
254,"The punitive calculus, with its just deserts gloss, may have political appeal and offer an antidote to the soft image that has beset the Service since its inception.",3
255,"However, this is to mistake not only the demanding nature of current practice but also the non-punitive knowledge, skills, and values which provide for its success.",3
256,"The AEC is but one example of a number of fruitful initiatives undertaken by practitioners in and through the medium of counselling, assisting, directing and monitoring.",3
257,The non-punitive approach of probation officers is a strength a weakness.,3
258,Some years ago the ‘Nothing Works’ school of thought dominated the Probation Service.,3
259,"Now it seems that some things work, especially those like the AEC that are associated with what has come to be described as the problem-focused/task-centred approach (Roberts, 1990).",3
260,"These new ways of working are simply a consolidation of the established pattern among officers of personalizing their practice, , carefully matching their particular social work knowledge and skills to the unique needs of  the individual offender (Singer, 1989).",3
261,This trend reflects a developing and successful specificity of probation practice: the pity is that this specificity of practice has not been complemented by a more appropriate specificity of language from the authors of the White Paper.,3
262,The Role of Residential and Nursing Homes in the Last Year of People's Lives ANN CARTWRIGHT,3
263,"Ann Cartwright, B.Sc., Ph.D., is Director of the Institute for Social Studies in Medical Care",3
264,SUMMARY,3
265,Almost a quarter of a random sample of adults dying in 1987 had spent part of the last year of their lives in a residential or nursing home; one in eight spent all of that year in one.,3
266,"The old, the unmarried.",3
267,"those with difficulty looking after themselves, the confused, the incontinent, the blind, the deaf, and the bad tempered were more likely to be in such homes than others.",3
268,With their greater dependency.,3
269,people living in residential homes received rather more consultations and home visits — although not night calls — from their general practitioners.,3
270,"But they did not get more help from community nurses and they were less likely to be admitted to, or to die in, a hospital or hospice.",3
271,"the assessments of relatives, friends, and neighbours who answered the questions, the quality of life of people who had been in a residential home for a year or more before their death was similar to that of others who died but had never been in such a home.",3
272,It was those who were admitted in the year before they died who were perceived as having a relatively poor quality of life in that year.,3
273,"Increasingly, the quality of life during the year before death is going to depend on the attributes of residential homes and their staff.",3
274,"The marked rise in the number of residential homes, particularly the recent growth in the private sector (DHSS, 1987; Bebbington and Tong 1986; Laing, 1985) has drawn attention to the somewhat uncertain role of these homes (Judge and Sinclair, 1986).",3
275,"Two areas of concern are first, who should have residential care and second, the relationship between residential and community care.",3
276,A recent study of people's lives in the year before their death makes it possible to examine the part residential and nursing homes play in caring for people during the   twelve months before their death.,3
277,"This paper then looks at the characteristics of the people who spent some or all of their time in such homes and at the care they got from general practitioners, community nurses and hospitals.",3
278,Care and conditions in the homes and the extent of visiting are described and a final section considers the quality of people's lives as perceived by their relatives and others.,3
279,METHODS,3
280,The data come from a study of a random sample of adult (aged 15 and over) deaths in ten areas of England in October and November 1987.,3
281,For these deaths we tried to identify and then interview the people who could tell us most about the last twelve months of the lives of the people who died.,3
282,"Someone was interviewed about 639 of the deaths, 80 of the original sample of 800.",3
283,"Husbands or wives were seen about 36 of the 639, other relatives about 43 , friends or neighbours about 10 , staff of institutions about 10 and other officials about one .",3
284,"Staff of institutions responded about 18 of those who had been in residential homes for less than a year, 47 of those in one for longer.",3
285,", the answers from different types of respondent did not differ all that widely and the variations that emerged seemed, , understandable the characteristics and circumstances of the people they were telling us about, although there did seem to be a tendency for the staff of homes to put a more rosy interpretation on situations.",3
286,"For an analysis of these differences, and for further details about the study, see Cartwright and Seale (1990).",3
287,TYPES OF HOMES AND NUMBERS RECEIVING CARE,3
288,"The ‘homes’ covered in this study include residential homes for older people, nursing homes and other institutions excluding hospitals or hospices.",3
289,For convenience they are referred to here as residential homes.,3
290,"Fourteen of the sample of deaths occurred in such homes; this compares with a much lower proportion, 5 in 1969 (Cartwright .,",3
291,1973).,3
292,"A further 9 of the people who died spent part of the last twelve months of their lives in such homes; so almost a quarter, 23 , were in residential homes at some stage in the last year of their lives.",3
293,The length of time they spent there and the types of homes involved are shown in Table 1.,3
294,"Those classed as ‘other homes’ included convalescent homes, a rehabilitation centre, an assessment centre, a holiday home for the disabled and rest homes which may in practice have been homes for older people (the classification was made on the basis of the information given by the person interviewed).",3
295,A relatively high proportion of those in other types of home were there for less than a month.,3
296,"Sixty-two of those in old people's homes had been there for a year or more compared with 47 of those in nursing homes, but this difference might have occurred by chance.",3
297,"Of the old people's homes, 56 were said to be run by the Council, 6 by a charity and 39 were private.",3
298,"In contrast the great majority of nursing homes, 83 , were privately run.",3
299,Nearly a quarter of those in nursing homes had not had to pay towards the cost of living there compared with only 7 of those in old people's homes.,3
300,The reason for the difference seemed to be that the DHSS paid for nursing home treatment in a number of instances: ‘They took the pension and attendance allowance and the DHSS paid the rest.’,3
301,"Nevertheless the proportion for whom payment was thought to have been something of a problem was 7 of all those in old people's homes (15 for private ones, 6 for others) and 17 of those in nursing homes — further differences which did not reach statistical significance.",3
302,WHO SPENDS ALL OR ANY PART OF THE LAST YEAR OF THEIR LIFE IN A RESIDENTIAL HOME?,3
303,"AGE, SEX AND FAMILY?",3
304,People who lived longer were more likely to have spent some or all of the last year of their lives in residential homes.,3
305,People have been counted as spending all of the last year of their lives in residential homes if they had lived in one for a year or more.,3
306,"(In fact, as will be seen later, a number of them were admitted to hospital during the last twelve months of their lives and some died in hospital.)",3
307,Few under 75 had spent any time in such homes but more than half those dying when they were aged 85 or more had spent some of the last year of their lives in one.,3
308,The figures are in Table 2 which also shows expected age related differences with sex and marital status.,3
309,Further analyses by age and marital status showed that married people less often spent any time in residential homes than single or previously married people of the same age.,3
310,"The proportions among those aged 75 — 84 were 8 of the married, 34 of the others, and for those aged 85 or more 25 compared with 61 .",3
311,Neill .,3
312,(1988) found that few married people applied for residential care and those who did so were less likely to be admitted than applicants who were single or widowed.,3
313,"There were no significant differences in the present study between the never and the previously married although it might be expected that people with children might be less likely to go into a home than those without any and the widowed, divorced, or separated are much more likely to have children than the single: 75 compared with 6 .",3
314,"An analysis by marital status and number of children showed that for the married the main difference was between those with no children, 17 of whom had been in a residential home, and those with one or more, for whom the proportion was 5 .",3
315,For the widowed or divorced there was no difference between those with and without children nor any significant trend with the number of children.,3
316,"So it would seem that children may assist one parent to care for the other who might otherwise go into a home, but this they have   to residential homes for some while caring for and thus avoiding the admission of others, and that these two influences cancel out in the statistics.",3
317,An analysis by the sex of children showed no significant differences between those with a son or sons only and those with only a daughter or daughters.,3
318,"An earlier study (Cartwright .,",3
319,1973) found that those with a daughter or daughters were more likely to die in their own homes than those with just a son or sons.,3
320,Data in Table 2 suggest that those with living brothers or sisters may be less likely to be admitted to a home.,3
321,Part of this is an age effect: the proportion with such relatives falling from 86 of those aged 45 — 54 to 41 of those aged 85 or more.,3
322,Among those aged 85 or more a similar proportion of those with and without living siblings had been admitted to a home at some stage but among those aged 75 — 84 more of those without any such relatives had been admitted: 30 compared with 17 .,3
323,These variations reflect the fact that siblings themselves age and die and therefore become less of a source of support as people grow older.,3
324,CAUSE OF DEATH,3
325,"People who died of cancer were less likely than those dying from other causes to have been in such homes, 7 against 29 .",3
326,The difference remains when the age at which they die is taken into account.,3
327,(Cause of death was taken from the death registration form as coded by OPCS.),3
328,"When the type of home was taken into account, those dying of respiratory disease were more likely to have been in nursing homes — 14 compared with 6 for those dying of other conditions — whereas those dying of stroke were more likely to have been in old people's homes: 27 against 12 .",3
329,SELF CARE,3
330,"The proportions reported to have had difficulty with various aspects of caring for themselves (getting in and a bath or shower, dressing and undressing, going to the toilet, washing and shaving, feeding themselves, making a hot drink, or needing help at night) for a year or more before death was 87 of those who had been in a residential home for a year or more, 60 of those in for a shorter time and 25 of those who had not been in such a home .",3
331,(People who had been in a hospital for all the year before they died have been excluded from these comparisons.),3
332,"But many of the symptoms asked about were reported for similar proportions of those who had been in residential homes and those who had not; these were pain, trouble with breathing, vomiting or feeling sick, drowsiness, sleeplessness, dry mouth or thirst, depression, loss of appetite, difficulty swallowing, dizziness, bed sores, an unpleasant smell, and backache.",3
333,"However, for a number of these symptoms, more people in residential homes had had them for a year or more: the proportions were 31 against 20 for drowsiness, 22 against 14 for dizziness, 19 against 11 for loss of appetite and 4 against one for bedsores.",3
334,"Only one symptom, a persistent cough, was reported more often for those who had been in a residential home — 24 compared with 10 of those who had spent some time in such a home.",3
335,When deaths from cancer were excluded the difference remained: 22 against 9 .,3
336,SYMPTOMS,3
337,The symptoms reported more frequently for those in residential homes are shown in Table 3.,3
338,"Several of them — constipation, confusion, urinary incontinence and difficulty seeing and hearing — have been shown elsewhere to increase with age (Cartwright, 1990a).",3
339,"Some of them, mental confusion, incontinence and difficulty seeing and hearing, may have contributed to them being admitted to such homes.",3
340,They can certainly make it more difficult for people to look after themselves.,3
341,"And among those people with confusion, constipation and incontinence, those in residential homes were more likely to have had the symptoms for a year or more.",3
342,"The figures were 81 compared with 39 for confusion, 78 and 52 for constipation, and 54 against 36 for incontinence.",3
343,Bad temper might result from being in such a home.,3
344,"Another explanation for the relatively high proportion of those in residential homes reported to be bad tempered could be that relatives, friends or neighbours were less likely to report or perceive the person who died as being bad tempered than staff of institutions.",3
345,"Among those in residential homes the frequency with which bad temper was reported was 31 when the respondent was a relative, friend or neighbour, 45 when he or she was a staff member — a difference which did not reach statistical significance.",3
346,"But if the comparison between those who   had been in a home and others is confined to those for whom relatives, neighbours or friends were interviewed, there is still a difference: 31 against 19 .",3
347,Bad temper could be either a cause or effect of being admitted to a residential home.,3
348,"Other studies have found that caring relatives are more likely to favour residential care as a solution for the elderly confused if the old person exhibits difficult behaviour (Levin .,",3
349,1989).,3
350,So the evidence suggests that their age and frailty those living in residential homes will have needed more care during the last year of their lives than other people who died.,3
351,CARE FROM GENERAL PRACTITIONERS,3
352,People in residential homes remain under the care of general practitioners.,3
353,"The numbers of consultations, home visits and night calls reported for those in such homes for a year or more before they died are compared with those for others under the care of a general practitioner in Table 4.",3
354,"As expected, those in residential homes had more consultations and more visits from their general practitioners than others.",3
355,"But, if anything, they had rather fewer night calls.",3
356,night calls are usually made in a crisis and the help normally available in residential homes may make it easier to cope with a minor one without calling out a doctor.,3
357,"In the minority of homes (a quarter) where all the residents had the same doctor, visiting rates were higher (16.8 a year on average) than in the majority (three-quarters) where the residents could have different doctors (9.5).",3
358,"However, the proportions for whom the general practitioner was described as reluctant to visit, or for whom it was felt it would have been helpful if the doctor had visited the person who died more often, did not vary significantly between the groups.",3
359,So it would seem that people in homes where they were free to have a doctor of their own choice were not seen as being more deprived of visits having fewer of them than people in homes where everyone had the same doctor.,3
360,Those in homes where everyone had the same doctor might receive less individual attention at visits if general practitioners saw several patients on the same visit.,3
361,The mixture of praise and criticism for general practitioners' care of people in residential homes was similar to comments about their care of others during the last year of their lives.,3
362,"Although most respondents praised, or were satisfied with, this care the study identified a number of inadequacies.",3
363,"Home visits were much appreciated when they happened   but failure to visit was one of the more common and significant criticisms (Cartwright, 1990b).",3
364,"The matron of a residential home, talking about a doctor who she felt was reluctant to visit said it would have been helpful if the person who died had been visited more often: ‘It would have given her more comfort and the staff more confidence.’",3
365,"When asked why she thought the doctor had not come more often, she replied, ‘The doctors feel the residents are in a rest home to  save them working.’",3
366,"The doctor had not been asked to come more often ‘because we're resigned to the fact that, unless it's an emergency, he won't come out.’",3
367,The matron also told us that this patient had to go into a nursing home ‘towards the end’ because ‘she needed morphine injections which the doctor wouldn't give otherwise she wouldn't have had to move to somewhere strange.,3
368,"She had to leave her room, her furniture: that's why she gave up.’",3
369,CARE IN HOSPITAL,3
370,People who had lived in old people's homes were less likely than others who died to have gone into a hospital or hospice during the last year of their lives or to die in one.,3
371,This can be seen from the figures in Table 5 which also suggest that the longer the time they had lived in an old people's home the less likely they were to go into hospital.,3
372,But those least likely to have spent time in a hospital or hospice or to die in one were those who had lived in a nursing home for a year or more.,3
373,This lower use of hospital inpatient facilities was not accounted for by the older age of the people in residential homes although fewer of all those aged 85 or more had spent time in hospital — 64 against 80 of those under 85.,3
374,"Among this older group 46 of those who had been in a residential home for a year or more were admitted, 75 of the others.",3
375,"There were similar differences when people   dying of respiratory disease and of cerebrovascular accident were considered separately: the proportions admitted to hospital were 25 and 47 of those in a residential home for a year or more, 76 and 89 of others among the two causes of death groups respectively.",3
376,The numbers dying of other causes were too small to analyse separately.,3
377,The only source of information from this study of any possible reluctance to admit people from residential homes to hospital relates to those who were admitted and respondents’ views on whether they should have been admitted earlier.,3
378,"This showed that in practice relatively few, one in ten, of those who had spent any time in residential homes were thought to have been admitted ‘too late’; this proportion was a quarter for those who had not spent any time in a residential home.",3
379,"Residential homes, and long stay nursing homes , appear to cut down the use of hospital care during the last year of people's lives.",3
380,What of the nursing care given by district and other nurses to those in old people's homes?,3
381,HELP FROM VISITING NURSES,3
382,"Just over a third, 35 , of those who had lived in an old people's home for a year or more had had help from a nurse who visited the home in the year before they died.",3
383,This was similar to the proportion receiving help from district and other nurses among those who had not spent any time in such homes once sudden deaths and those who had spent all their last year in hospital have been excluded.,3
384,They also received similar numbers of visits.,3
385,"Given their age, symptoms and frailty, it might have been thought that the residents of old people's homes would receive more care from visiting nurses than people in the community, as they received more visits from general practitioners.",3
386,But some of the less skilled tasks undertaken by district and other nurses for people living in their own homes were probably done by staff in the residential homes.,3
387,The next section looks at respondents' views of the care given to people in residential and nursing homes and the conditions there.,3
388,CARE AND CONDITIONS IN THE HOMES,3
389,"Almost nine tenths, 88 , of the people who had spent some time in a residential home were said to have had access to a telephone where they could make calls and people could telephone them.",3
390,"Among those  who did not have this facility, two-fifths were thought to have wanted it.",3
391,"Ninety-two of those in old people's homes compared with 82 of those in other sorts of homes had this amenity — a difference which fell short of statistical significance — but more of those in old people's homes had a room of their own, two-thirds against half.",3
392,Overall the proportion with a room of their own was three-fifths and again two-fifths of those without one were thought to have wanted one.,3
393,"If the respondent was a relative, friend, or neighbour, they were asked to say whether they thought various aspects of the home were good or not so good.",3
394,The replies of those who felt able to make these assessments are shown in Table 6.,3
395,"Clearly their views may have been different from those of the people who died, but respondents are likely to have taken into account the reactions of their relatives and friends, and how these respondents felt about the care in the homes is also of interest and concern.",3
396,"The most frequent criticism was of the food, and over this there was a difference between old people's homes for which 26 thought the food ‘not so good’ and nursing homes for which it was 7 .",3
397,"There were no differences between Council homes and private ones on any of these assessments, nor in the amenities available.",3
398,And the overall assessments of the homes were similar in the two groups and between nursing homes and old people's homes.,3
399,"Altogether 50 were described as ‘excellent’, 31 as ‘good’, 9 as ‘fair’, 6 as ‘poor’ and one as ‘dreadful’, with 3 making other comments.",3
400,A number of criticisms were exacerbated by feelings that people were in the wrong type of institution.,3
401,A son whose father had Parkinson's disease and had been in an old people's home commented:,3
402,"They were not equipped to deal with a progressive condition, they were not that kind of establishment.",3
403,The degree of mental stimulation was absent.,3
404,It was a very distressing time for him.,3
405,The whole point of his being there was his condition.,3
406,"He could have been in a hotel, had he not needed care and supervision which he blatantly did not get.",3
407,The daughter of a woman with Huntingdon's chorea who had been in a nursing home described the care she got there as,3
408,"Limited — not because they didn't want to care, they just didn't know how to care for this type of patient….",3
409,It should not be registered as a nursing home.,3
410,The one ‘dreadful’ home was thought to have contributed to the death of the man admitted there:,3
411,"It was an awful place: dreary, badly furnished and he wasn't as clean as he'd been in hospital — food all down his clothes and he hadn't shaved, he really looked unkempt.",3
412,I don't think the staff cared.,3
413,I'm sure the fact of moving to the home contributed to his death.,3
414,He was so well when he left hospital…and the deterioration within a week was unbelievable.,3
415,I just feel he gave up when he got in that home.,3
416,(Died of Parkinson's disease and pneumonia aged 73 within 24 hours of being readmitted to hospital after being in an old people's home for less than a month.),3
417,A number of respondents commented on the lack of stimulation: ‘They sat in the front room and didn't move.,3
418,"Just sat there, no t.v. and no-one seemed to talk to them.’",3
419,"When asked about the other residents in the homes, respondents' views were roughly equally divided about whether the person who died had on balance found them helpful (25 ) or tiresome (22 ).",3
420,"Most of them, however, 53 , made other comments, generally to the effect that the person had had little to do with other residents: ‘Her mind had gone so she was not able to socialise.,",3
421,"Many of the relatives and friends who rated the homes as an excellent place for the person who died to live towards the end of his or her life made rather perfunctory comments: ‘I can't fault the home’; ‘It was very nice, no qualms about it.’",3
422,Others were rather more forthcoming:,3
423,"I would say that, ‘spoon-feeding’ the residents, they tried to make them independent.",3
424,The staff were always there to help but didn't impose themselves.,3
425,This was very good.,3
426,And they kept her there when they could have sent her to hospital.,3
427,(Friend of woman who had had a number of strokes.),3
428,A wife whose husband had had multiple sclerosis and went to a holiday home for the disabled for two weeks to give her a rest said:,3
429,"It's a good idea, gets them home to meet new people.",3
430,They deserve a holiday like everybody else.,3
431,"He had a good time, said he really enjoyed it and would like to go again, and I had all the washing done for me — he didn't bring anything home dirty except the previous day's clothes.",3
432,Sometimes relatives and patients had obviously had different views of the home.,3
433,One daughter-in-law who rated the home as excellent went on to explain that her mother-in-law:,3
434,hated everything about everything.,3
435,We thought they were angels in the home and that everything was marvellous.,3
436,The staff told us she was the most difficult lady — as far as she was concerned nothing was right.,3
437,"She had to share (the bathroom and lavatory) much to her annoyance, but they were just her room.",3
438,You get what you pay for.,3
439,The views of people who had previously looked after those who died sometimes reflected their gratitude and admiration for the people who took on this task.,3
440,A friend of 30 years standing who had previously cared for a woman with senile dementia described how:,3
441,I thought she was just being awkward until she slowly went downhill and became incontinent.,3
442,I got help from the social services for this: they brought sheets and pillowcases from the hospital.,3
443,The crux came when she became doubly incontinent and her mind had got to the point where she had forgotten how her body functioned.,3
444,It was winter and I was changing her clothes three times a day and my self-control snapped and I shook her very hard to stop her sitting down without her pants and was so upset by my behaviour and frightened by what I had done that they agreed to put her in a home.,3
445,The young nurses were very kind and would kiss and cuddle her.,3
446,VISITING,3
447,"How much contact do people in residential homes have with relatives, friends, and neighbours outside?",3
448,This question is considered for people who had been in such homes for a year or more.,3
449,The number of different visitors they were reported to have had during the last twelve months averaged 5.0.,3
450,"Seven had none, 52 had one to four, 33 five to nine, and 8 ten or more.",3
451,"The number of visits was much greater: 11 had 300 or more — almost one a day, 33 between 100 and 300 — two or more a week on average, 19 50 — 99, between one and two a week, 4 20–49 — between one a fortnight and one a week, 14 10–19 — one a fortnight, 12 had 10 or one a month.",3
452,"The number of visits was strongly related to the number of visitors: of those with five visitors, a quarter had a hundred or more visits, but this proportion was three-quarters for those with five or more visitors.",3
453,"Of those who were visited, 44 had only relatives to see them, 11 were visited just by friends or neighbours and 45 by both relatives and friends; the most frequent visitor was a relative for 78 and a friend or neighbour for 22 .",3
454,Three of the five who had no visitors were said by the people we interviewed to have had no relatives.,3
455,"Neither of the other two who had no visitors had any children; one had elderly relatives abroad, the other, in the opinion of the deputy officer the home, only had herself to thank:",3
456,her awkward manipulative ways she just didn't get any visitors.,3
457,She did get visits from other visitors but they wore off her awkwardness.,3
458,…She went her way to be unpleasant to people.,3
459,Isaacs and his colleagues (1972) found that relatives' failure to provide basic care for elderly people was often associated with their previous rejection by the elderly person.,3
460,"However, for one in five of the people in residential homes for a year or more, our respondents said that there were relatives who they felt might have visited more often.",3
461,This compares with one in four of those living in the community who were felt to have relatives who might have helped more — a difference which might well occur by chance.,3
462,QUALITY OF LIFE,3
463,"Respondents were asked whether they would describe the quality of life of the person in the year before they died as good, fair, or poor.",3
464,Two things appeared to affect this assessment independently.,3
465,One was whether the respondent was a staff member or a relative.,3
466,Those spending any time in a residential home were less often described as having a poor quality of life if the respondent was a staff member than if he or she was a relative: 10 compared with 42 .,3
467,"This probably reflects the perceptions of the respondents a real difference in the actual quality of life of the people who died, although staff members may have been more willing to act as respondents for residents they had got on well with, and those residents may have had a better quality of life their relationship with the staff.",3
468,The other factor that was related to assessments of quality of life was whether people had been in a residential home for a year or more or for a shorter  time.,3
469,"Taking all types of respondents together their ratings were similar for people who had not been in a residential home and those who had been in one for a year or more, while those who had only spent part of the last year of their lives in a residential home were generally felt to have had a worse quality of life: for 39 of them it was rated as poor compared with 27 of the other two groups.",3
470,The difference between those spending all and those spending some of the last twelve months in a home persisted when the analysis is confined to those for whom relatives responded.,3
471,This can be seen in Table 7.,3
472,", among those for whom a staff member responded only one in twelve of those admitted during the last year of the life was felt to have had a good quality of life during that time compared with nearly half (46 ) of those who had been in a home for a year or more.",3
473,One possible explanation for these findings is that people take time to adjust to living in residential homes.,3
474,Another possibility is that those going into residential homes shortly before their death do so in a crisis situation.,3
475,Weaver and his colleagues (1985) found that residents most able to come to terms with admission were those who had exercised some degree of control or choice in entering residential care.,3
476,"Findings from the present study suggest that once people had become established in the homes their quality of life, in the opinion of their relatives, was similar to that of other people who died and had never been in such homes.",3
477,DISCUSSION,3
478,"Most of the people, just over two thirds, who spent all the last year of their life in a residential or nursing home were 85 or more, and it is this age group which is predicted to increase most rapidly in the next twenty years (Central Statistical Office (CSO), 1989) so it is likely that increasing numbers will spend the last year of their lives in such homes.",3
479,But this increase may not be as great as the rise in the numbers of older people if there is an improvement in their state of fitness as Jefferys and Thane (1989) suggest.,3
480,"The symptoms that were more common among those in residential homes, particularly confusion, incontinence, and bad temper, indicate some of the problems in making these homes attractive and stimulating places to live.",3
481,The description of one man of ninety-four illustrates many of the difficulties:,3
482,"He wasn't ill, it was just general deterioration.",3
483,"He was still quite active for his age, but his mental deterioration was the problem — he'd lost his sense of direction.",3
484,He found it difficult to accept his own failings.,3
485,"Memory loss was the worst aspect, the fact that he was unable to complete a crossword puzzle in ten minutes as he once could troubled him.",3
486,He was suffering from frustration.,3
487,"He was worried because he was deaf, worried his bowels.",3
488,He worried a lot.,3
489,"He was, I think, unhappy and tired.",3
490,He often said he'd had enough of living and was ‘ready to go’ was how he put it.,3
491,(Died from falling down a flight of steps and fracturing his skull.),3
492,That man was admitted to hospital after his fall and died there within a week without regaining consciousness.,3
493,"But people living in residential homes were less likely than others either to die in, or to be admitted to, hospital during the last year of their lives.",3
494,"Residential homes seem to cut down the use of hospital care; they probably also reduce the need for it, but this is less certain.",3
495,"They may also reduce the demand and need for night calls from general practitioners and, taking into account the age and frailty of residents, the pressures on the district nursing service.",3
496,the nature of the sample this study could not ascertain the views of residents themselves.,3
497,"Others who have done so have argued that elderly people are often faced with a choice between an unpleasant battle to survive in their own homes and an equally unpleasant enforced dependence in the institution (Wilkin and Hughes, 1987).",3
498,"In this study relatives and friends generally thought conditions in the home were ‘good’ ‘not so good’, although a number of their comments and descriptions indicate that circumstances were sometimes ideal and analysis of respondents' views of the quality of life suggest that  the initial period after admission may be particularly stressful for residents.",3
499,"While most residents were in fairly frequent contact with relatives and friends from outside the home, one in five of those who spent all the last twelve months of their lives in a home had either no visitors or one visit a month.",3
500,Becoming old and frail can be distressing; to be also isolated from relatives and friends seems dire.,3
501,The task of relieving avoidable distress and creating a caring and heartening environment in residential and nursing homes is going to be of increasing importance in determining the quality of the last year of people's lives.,3
502,How can we Measure the Effects of Client Participation on the Effectiveness of Social Work Intervention?,3
503,ALAN S. YORK and HAYA ITZHAKY,3
504,"Alan York was born in England and received his BA (in law) from Trinity College, Oxford in 1962.",3
505,"In 1963 he emigrated to Israel, took a certificate in Community Social Work in Tel Aviv and worked as a community worker in an immigrant development town.",3
506,He returned to England in 1970 and took his MA in Social Work at Leicester in 1972.,3
507,"He received his doctorate (in sociology) at Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel in 1979.",3
508,Haya Itzhaky was born and brought up in Israel and graduated from the School of Social Work at Bar-Ilan University in 1973.,3
509,"She worked as a community worker in an immigrant village, and took her MA (in social work) and her doctorate (in sociology) in Bar-Ilan.",3
510,"Both Dr York and Dr Itzhaky teach in the School of Social Work at Bar-Ilan University, where they are the community work specialization.",3
511,SUMMARY,3
512,This paper examines the concepts of client or citizen participation in community work and of effectiveness in social work and other related fields.,3
513,"It surveys and summarizes the literature in these two fields, focusing on how the two key concepts are empirically measured.",3
514,"After examining the literature on the effects of citizen participation on community work intervention, the paper puts forward an operative model for both researchers and practitioners to measure how the participation of clients can make community work more effective and productive.",3
515,"The underlying assumption (or, more accurately, hypothesis) of this paper is that client participation makes for a better social work intervention, and thus the higher the degree of client participation the more effective the intervention will be (Kurzman and Solomon, 1970; Freedberg, 1989; York, 1989).",3
516,In Bernstein's words:,3
517,"we find that imposing, telling or giving orders do not work well.",3
518,"Only as the client is thoroughly involved and comes to accept on deepening levels the   process of change can our methods be effective our goals (Bernstein, 1960, p. 8).",3
519,"Most of the debate on the validity and primacy of client self-determination has taken place within the casework context (Bernstein, 1960; McDermott, 1975; Freedberg, 1989) where the elements of eligibility, statutory rights, social control and professional authority may be of central importance (Rothman, 1989; Spicker, 1990).",3
520,"This paper will consider the issue in the context of community work, in which the elements accentuated by Rothman are of less consequence and client participation has indisputably remained a primary value.",3
521,We are currently engaged on a research project that seeks to test empirically whether client participation does indeed increase the effectiveness of community work intervention.,3
522,"We found much literature on client participation and even more on effectiveness, but there is considerable controversy on how to measure these variables.",3
523,Thus the scarce research work on the effects of participation on effectiveness is further limited by its inability clearly to define (and to measure) what it is studying.,3
524,"In this paper, we shall review the relevant literature, including that from other applied social sciences, and show the operative implications for research and practice.",3
525,"The first section will review the literature on client participation and its measurement, and the second section will summarize the ‘state of the art’ in the measurement of effectiveness, stressing evaluation of community work intervention.",3
526,The third section will review the published research linking participation and effectiveness in social work and other human welfare interventions and programmes.,3
527,"If these researchers had succeeded in measuring operatively and empirically what degree of participation was achieved and how this affected the degree of effectiveness, then our search would have been finished.",3
528,"The reader will have guessed, , that the quest was unsuccessful, and so the final section will suggest an operative model with practical implications for community work practitioners and researchers.",3
529,WHAT IS CLIENT PARTICIPATION AND HOW CAN WE MEASURE IT?,3
530,"Traditionally social workers have espoused client self-determination, the right of the clients to participate in decisions affecting their lives and interests (Kurzman and Solomon, 1970; Gilbert and Specht, 1976).",3
531,"Many and varied reasons have been put forward for this basic element of practice, but they can be summarized under three headings: ideological reasons (the right of a person to decide for himself or the recognition of this as an existential reality), educational and developmental reasons (participation as part of human growth and development, for the individual, the family, the group, the organization or the community), and political reasons (participation as a means to enfranchisement and empowerment, an antidote to alienation)(Ross, 1960; Bernstein, 1960; Katan, 1980; Freedberg, 1989; Rothman, 1989).",3
532,Freedberg (1989) has shown how social workers have applied the principle in different ways at different times.,3
533,"Bernstein (1960) puts forward limitations on self-determination, and shows how it stems from ‘the supreme social work value…human worth’(p. 7).",3
534,"Thus self-determination is not an absolute value, but it is ‘supremely important.",3
535,Only through the rich utilization of this concept can we fully honor the human-worth value’(p. 8).,3
536,Rothman (1989) extends Bernstein's critique and suggests that many social workers use manipulative and directive techniques under the guise of self-determination.,3
537,"He suggests the construction of a continuum of categories, each with its set of conditional factors, in which the practitioner could decide upon the degree of directiveness or non-directiveness needed in a specific situation.",3
538,Almost all the examples he gives for a restriction of client participation are of a community work situation.,3
539,"Defined simply (even simplistically) client participation means that the client system, as a whole or , is part of the action system.",3
540,How can we measure client participation in community work?,3
541,What are the dimensions that can be observed empirically?,3
542,The literature is well developed and offers a wealth of suggestions.,3
543,"Arnstein (1969), Hollnsteiner (1977) and Wandersman (1979a) base typologies on the distribution of power between the establishment and the clients, drawing similar but slightly different levels between the two extremes, and considering other relevant dimensions roles, representation, influence, and the stages of the process.",3
544,"Mogulof (1974) sees a dialectic in which the establishment and the change agent system determine how much participation they will allow, while the client system decides how strong is its desire or demand for participation.",3
545,"The level of participation becomes, therefore, a function of the motivation of the partners.",3
546,"Susskind and Elliot (1981) take a similar line, seeing the relationship between the establishment and the client system as an evolution from paternalism to co-operation via conflict.",3
547,Others prefer a multiplicity of dimensions.,3
548,Cole (1974) describes two major dimensions: the scale of participation and its range.,3
549,"The former delimits the activity involved, the latter the number of participants.",3
550,"Wandersman (1979b) outlines five dimensions: the setting and the scale of the activity, the stage in the process at which participation takes place, the identity and the representativeness of the participants, the level of participation (as described above in Wandersman, 1979a), and the different techniques used by the change agent in achieving participation.",3
551,"Finally, Liron and Spiro (1988) choose three multi-faceted dimensions to examine the participation of clients in the Israeli Urban Renewal Project: authority (how central, final, and comprehensive are the decisions of the participatory steering committees, and how complete is their domination over resources), the influence of the client representatives the establishment and the professionals, and the representativeness of these representatives.",3
552,"All of the dimensions from the literature are measurable, and many of the authors present operative techniques for their measurement.",3
553,"Thus we shall conclude this first section by summarizing six criteria put forward in the literature reviewed above, together comprising a multidimensional and empirical test of the extent of client participation at the community level.",3
554,1.,3
555,LEVELS OF PARTICIPATION,3
556,"The levels will reflect the influence and authority of the different partners, and the distribution of power among them.",3
557,2.,3
558,TYPE AND SCALE OF ACTIVITIES,3
559,In what types of activities or interventions are the levels of participation applied?,3
560,The scale of the activities can be inferred both from the activity type and the level of participation involved.,3
561,3.,3
562,REPRESENTATIVENESS OF CLIENT PARTICIPANTS,3
563,How far do the clients involved in participation represent the complete client system?,3
564,"This question is important whether the client system be a social group, a committee of a functional community or a neighbourhood activist group.",3
565,"In one way or another, the representatives will be compared with the total client system.",3
566,THE ORIGINS OF PARTICIPATION,3
567,Upon what authority do the clients participate and whose initiative was it that launched the participation?,3
568,"Is participation voluntary and welcomed by the clients, or is it demanded of them by the action system, the change agent or even by some extraneous system, as in some parent-teacher associations?",3
569,TECHNIQUES OF PARTICIPATION,3
570,What methods are used to achieve client participation?,3
571,"The different methods will reflect different levels of participation, and show how broad the participatory front is.",3
572,ATTITUDES TO CLIENT PARTICIPATION,3
573,It seems clear to us that all of the above criteria will be enhanced or negated by the way in which the change agent or the action system reacts to participation: what stereotypes do they have of client representatives? do they believe in participation? what expectations do they have of participation and client representatives?,3
574,"Similarly, parallel questions will be asked of the participants, for the clients also bring expectations and stereotypes (of the workers, administration, etc. and of their fellow clients) to participation, a wide gamut of often conflicting ideologies.",3
575,WHAT IS EFFECTIVENESS AND HOW CAN WE MEASURE IT?,3
576,"Social work has begun to evaluate its effectiveness in the last fifty years, and Sheldon (1986) has described two separate waves of reviews and researches.",3
577,"From the 1940s till the early 1970s the question asked was ‘does social work work?’, and the answers given, by Mullen and Dumpson (1972), Fischer (1973 and 1976), and Wood (1978), were generally negative: social work intervention was apparently ineffective.",3
578,"The second wave, from the 1970s to the present day, have limited their attention to the question ‘how effective is a particular program with a particular type of client?’",3
579,"(Reid and Hanrahan, 1982, p. 328), and the answers appear to be positive.",3
580,"Reid and Hanrahan (1982), in a review of twenty-eight studies between the years 1973 and 1981, find that the objectives of the interventions were generally achieved, and so they conclude that ‘intervention carried out by social workers can be effective’(p. 333).",3
581,"Of particular importance to the subject of this paper, they emphasize in their summary that the client in the studies reviewed ‘is engaged as a voluntary collaborator’, and his ‘motivations were directed toward what the social workers were attempting to provide’.",3
582,"This kind of  ‘motivational congruence between practitioners and clients’ was generally missing from the studies in the first wave of effectiveness research, they suggest (p. 338).",3
583,"This implies the connection between client participation and effectiveness that Bernstein (1960)(as quoted above) seems to take almost as axiomatic, and which we would like to demonstrate empirically.",3
584,"Ruben (1985) reviews twelve more research studies between 1978 and 1983, and generally replicates the findings of Reid and Hanrahan.",3
585,"(See also Brawley and Martinez-Brawley, 1988.)",3
586,How is effectiveness defined and measured in these studies?,3
587,Sheldon (1986) points out that ‘effectiveness’ is not absolute: for whom? what? are some of the limitations.,3
588,Thus his definition is ‘a much less ambitious affair’:,3
589,"It implies describing carefully the nature, extent and implications of any problems intervention; saying what it is you might do to alter these and why it would be beneficial to try; describing how best this might be brought about; saying in advance what kinds of public test might be applied to support the view that something worthwhile has been achieved; pursuing a solution, and then defending the results against criticism from peers (Sheldon, 1986, p. 224).",3
590,"However, the literature so far described is concerned almost entirely with social work at the micro level: individuals, families and small groups, much of it using techniques that are of little relevance to community work, behaviour modification.",3
591,Sheldon (1986) suggests that one implication of the research findings is that social workers are more effective on ‘smaller-scale problems’ than ‘large-scale experiments on problems of genuine concern to the community’.,3
592,"Jenkins (1987) describes effectiveness research so far as a ‘limited concept, primarily relating to the intervention process’ and with little validity in the ‘macro area’.",3
593,"Rees (1987) maintains that effectiveness is meaningless without usefulness, and this implies, among other things, political constraints.",3
594,Thus our review of literature must now address those studies specifically concerned with the evaluation of effectiveness in community work.,3
595,"Key and his associates (1976), in an attempt to decide how to evaluate their community project, make a thorough review of evaluation research literature.",3
596,"They emphasize qualitative and quantitative approaches, methods ranging from the rational to the intuitive, and the role of the clients in the evaluative process.",3
597,Hunt (1987) states the dilemma more briefly: the scientific approach may be quite unrealistic.,3
598,"Control groups are not relevant, and important variables can seldom be specified in advance the complexity and dynamic nature of the processes involved.",3
599,"Objectives are usually very general to begin with, and the non-directive nature of the work means that they are defined as  the work goes on.",3
600,"Finally, she asks, ‘when is an outcome not an outcome?’, , how are outcomes defined and for whom: funders? community workers? people/clients? researchers?",3
601,"These studies (and earlier studies by the team of Epstein, Fellin and Tripodi: Tripodi .,",3
602,"1971; Epstein .,",3
603,"1973) lay a basis for the study of effectiveness in community work, but, giving clear, operative and replicable indications of how to measure it, emphasize the problematical nature of the task.",3
604,"Thus, in the spirit of the culture of openness and coherence proposed by Rees (1987), let us consider what might be learned from other applied social sciences, particularly management science.",3
605,"Lewin and Minton (1986) in their comprehensive survey of the literature find no thirteen to management from the year 1911 onwards, each with its own typical effectiveness attributes.",3
606,"Steers (1975), summarizing seventeen research studies, finds various criteria of effectiveness, but the three most frequent ones are adaptiveness, productivity, and participant satisfaction (meaning, , worker, not client participation).",3
607,"He concludes that the effectiveness of a given system should be based on its ability to fit in with the external systems making up its environment on the one hand, and, on the other hand, on its competence in allowing its own sub-systems to fit in with .",3
608,This model is clearly process oriented.,3
609,"Pennings and Goodman (1977) present a systems model that also stresses internal processes: they see effectiveness as the result of coalitions and arrangements between dominant and interest groups, and the satisfaction of the participants from the efficiency of these inner processes.",3
610,"Miles (1980) presents an ‘ecology model’, not dissimilar to the systems models.",3
611,"Dividing previous schools of thought into goal attainment models and systems models (and criticizing both of them), Miles defines organizational effectiveness as ‘the ability of the organization to minimally satisfy the expectations of its strategic constituencies’(Miles, 1980, p. 375), thus demanding both sets of criteria.",3
612,"However, the criteria of effectiveness will change with the different constituencies: different sub-systems will define effectiveness differently, some goal attainment (say the management and the stock holders) and some process (the workers, ).",3
613,"This means that ‘organizational assessment is best conceived of not as a one-shot affair, but as an ongoing process’(Miles, 1980, p. 380).",3
614,"Campbell (1977) too divides organizational effectiveness into two categories: ‘goal-centred’ and ‘natural system’, and he lists no thirty criteria ‘that have been proposed seriously as indices of organizational effectiveness’(p. 36).",3
615,"Probably, therefore, Cameron (1986) is right when, after  summarizing five areas of agreement on effectiveness and three areas of conflict, he concludes that ‘agreement about effectiveness is mainly an agreement to disagree’(p. 544).",3
616,His suggestion is to see competing criteria as both compatible and congruent and to accept that ‘organizational effectiveness is inherently paradoxical.,3
617,"To be effective, an organization must possess attributes that are simultaneously contradictory, even mutually exclusive,(Cameron, 1986, pp. 544–5).",3
618,"Thus successful organizations will have a high degree of role specialization (reinforcing expertise and efficiency) together with a high generality of roles (encouraging flexibility and interdependency), a continuity of leadership alongside of infusion of new leaders, .",3
619,"Our conclusion must be that there are many criteria of organizational effectiveness, some of which are mutually exclusive, yet, paradoxically, these seemingly conflicting attributes are able to co-exist and to work together.",3
620,Most of these criteria are measurable and have been measured in management research in quantifiable terms.,3
621,It remains to be seen to what extent they can be applied to social work.,3
622,"We propose two composite criteria for the measurement of effectiveness, both using variables used in previous research, the specific demands and context of the researcher or practitioner.",3
623,1.,3
624,CLASSIFICATION OF EFFECTIVENESS,3
625,"Using the terms of Miles (1980), we classify effectiveness by ‘goal attainment’(that is goal achievement, productivity, etc.) and ‘systems processes’(adaptiveness, participant satisfaction, inner processes, systems resources, etc.).",3
626,The assessor may use either of these classifications (with whatever sub-groups he or she prefers) or both of them.,3
627,"Both measurements of effectiveness are valid, and the one used will depend upon the purpose of the assessment, the customer ordering the assessment and the audience at which the assessment is aimed.",3
628,An evaluation of effectiveness of a community economic enterprise productivity and profit is legitimate in one set of circumstances; the same evaluation of the same enterprise citizen satisfaction and decision-making processes is equally legitimate in another set of circumstances.,3
629,"If possible, the evaluation will include both types of effectiveness measurement.",3
630,2.,3
631,EFFECTIVENESS EVALUATED BY WHOM?,3
632,Clearly not just the type of evaluation of effectiveness but its essence will be affected by who evaluates.,3
633,"In the example of a factory, completely different assessments may be expected from the board of directors, shareholders, management, workers, and shop-stewards.",3
634,DOES PARTICIPATION LEAD TO EFFECTIVENESS?,3
635,A REVIEW OF LITERATURE,3
636,The amount of published research on this topic is not extensive.,3
637,"The management research field includes many studies on effectiveness, but the only type of participation to be found in them is worker participation, quite different from our topic of client participation.",3
638,"Some of the conclusions from this literature do seem applicable to our topic, and they will be considered at the end of this section.",3
639,"Research on the participation of the public or clients tends to centre around the form of participation involved (inputs) and its effect on the change agent and action systems (processes, ‘thruputs’), but little attention is paid to the results of participation (outputs) , and in achieving the specific goals of the activity involved.",3
640,"Moreover, the conclusions of the studies which do consider the effectiveness of participation are clear or unanimous.",3
641,"Mazmanian (1976), in his evaluation of projects carried out by the Corps of Engineers, and Gilbert and Specht (1977), in their classic evaluation of the Model City programme between the years 1967 — 71, appear to reach a similar conclusion: participation helps process but not goal attainment.",3
642,"Mazmanian finds participation effective in such process goals as leading to public appreciation of the Engineers' work, but not in what he calls ‘product’ goals, increasing public support for the projects or recommending courses of action.",3
643,"Gilbert and Specht show that project workers used client participation effectively in the planning stage, where the process was the main consideration, work was non-directive, and the major skills needed of the worker were interactional in nature.",3
644,"But when they reached the implementation stage, in which their orientation was to concrete tasks and the skills required of them were chiefly technical, then they became more directive and used client participation less.",3
645,"These conclusions appear to have been replicated by York (1989), who finds that community workers express more satisfaction and effectiveness in their short-term projects, which are more directive and task-oriented, than in their long-term projects.",3
646,"However, the conclusions of Gilbert and Specht are indirect and do not necessarily show that client participation in implementation stages is ineffective.",3
647,"As York finds, workers prefer not to involve their clients in short-term task processes, but this may be for a multitude of reasons that of effectiveness: lack of time (client participation is generally time consuming), agency policy and pressure (paternalism), professional socialization and norms, .",3
648,"Only Mazmanian, so far, clearly states that client participation leads to ineffectiveness, and  he does so only for ‘product goals’.",3
649,We should like to know more about how participation was achieved in these projects and what was the nature of the tasks involved.,3
650,"In any case, it is clear that Mazmanian does not deal with social work programmes, and the change agents involved were not social workers.",3
651,"Gittell (1980), in a research study of school-related citizen organizations in three American cities, finds that both lower- and middle-class parent organizations had little effect on educational decision-making, their declared goal.",3
652,"In our terms, client participation was not effective.",3
653,"However, she shows how imperfect was the participation, particularly in lower-class organizations, and also makes clear that some of the objectives were achieved.",3
654,Thus Gittell's data are not conclusive.,3
655,"Rosener (1978) finds much consideration in the literature of participation as an end in itself, and this is relatively easy to evaluate: how many clients participated? what kinds of people? how frequently? how much time did they invest? what were their attitudes (and those of the workers) to participation?",3
656,"However, participation is seldom evaluated as a means to an end, that is effectiveness, she maintains.",3
657,"To do this, two difficult questions must be answered: what are the criteria of effectiveness (goals and objectives) the different participants (citizens, officials, workers)? and how clear is the cause/effect relationship between these goals and participation?",3
658,"Thus Rosener suggests a matrix between ‘knowledge of a cause/effect relationship between participation program and achievement of specified goals and objectives’(complete or incomplete) and ‘agreement on program goals and objectives, whose they are, and the criteria to measure success and failure’(yes or no)(1978, p. 459).",3
659,"But, as Rosener herself points out, examples of complete knowledge and perfect agreement are rare indeed.",3
660,"We learn, therefore, two important lessons: deciding before intervention what our goals and objectives are, if possible a common decision of all the participants (though separate, if not conflicting decisions would be legitimate); and setting criteria and measurement indicators to show the relationship between participation and effectiveness.",3
661,"The first point is undeniable, and few field workers and even fewer researchers would object to it (though its applicability may be complicated by the dynamic development of a project).",3
662,"The second point is more difficult, for how often in the social sciences do we have ‘complete knowledge’ of a cause/effect relationship?",3
663,The aspiration towards some sort of rational understanding of the causal relationship is probably the best we can achieve.,3
664,"Although management science literature on worker participation is of limited relevance to the topic of client participation, some of the recent research on the relationship between worker participation and  productivity sheds light, in our opinion, on the wider topic of how participation leads to effectiveness.",3
665,Erez .,3
666,"(1985) suggest that participation does not cause better performance; they hypothesize that participation in decision making strengthens the level of goal acceptance, and this leads to better performance.",3
667,Thus the causal model is a two-step one.,3
668,"Their two empirical studies, one laboratory and one in the field, partially support their hypotheses: increased goal acceptance leads to more effective performance, and participation is an effective strategy to enhance goal acceptance.",3
669,"They suggest that this may be through the perceived control an individual has over his goals, as compared to that when goals are externally assigned.",3
670,"Miller and Monge (1986), in their ‘meta-analytic review’ of participation, satisfaction, and productivity, in forty-seven articles and book chapters, find two possible models to explain how participation and productivity are linked.",3
671,"The cognitive model proposes a direct causal link: participation brings about enhanced information on goals, and so performance is improved.",3
672,"The affective model, like that of Erez and her associates, is multi-stage: participation fulfils needs, these lead to satisfaction which strengthens motivation, and thus workers' productivity is improved.",3
673,Both of these models are supported by their analysis.,3
674,"They suggest that the models may be linked, and further suggest that the direction of the causal link between participation and satisfaction is not entirely clear: possibly satisfaction leads to participation and not .",3
675,Both of these management research studies stress the complexity of the relationship between participation and effectiveness and of the variables involved.,3
676,"Thus we can use the existing research to help us find our empirical measures for the effects of client participation on effectiveness in social work, but we have not yet achieved our aim.",3
677,"None of the studies presents an operative model (Rosener, in our opinion, comes closest, but her model, as she shows herself, is more heuristic than empirical), and so in the next section a model will be set out and explained the evaluation criteria for participation and effectiveness put forward in the first two sections of this paper.",3
678,We believe the model can be used to answer the question posed in the title of this paper.,3
679,PARTICIPATION AND EFFECTIVENESS: AN OPERATIVE MODEL,3
680,"In the evaluation of the effectiveness of social services and interventions, we have shown the importance of who evaluates, and our model identifies three different systems (on the basis of Gilbert and Specht, 1979, and Pincus and Minahan, 1973) that could be involved in the process:",3
681,1.,3
682,Change Agents — professional and para-professional workers in the change agent system;,3
683,2.,3
684,"Administration, Political and Administrative Establishment — within the change agent system and in the larger systems of which the change agent system is a sub-system, politicians and bureaucrats in local or national government within which the change agent system is located;",3
685,3.,3
686,"Clients — individuals and groups within the client system, those that were part of the action system and those that were not.",3
687,"These, then, are the three groups that will evaluate the effectiveness of client participation, each in its own way and using its own peculiar criteria.",3
688,"Each of the three groups will use the double classification of goal attainment (goal achievement, productivity, etc.) and systems processes (adaptiveness, participant satisfaction, inner processes, systems resources, etc.), as explained above in the summary of the section on effectiveness.",3
689,"Thus the model includes six categories of effectiveness evaluation, two each for all three groups of evaluators.",3
690,They are summarized in Table 1 with examples given of the types of outputs to be expected in each of the categories.,3
691,"The change agents, their professional values, get satisfaction client participation (Bernstein, 1960, although the findings in York, 1989, referred to above, in the third section, may throw some doubt on this).",3
692,"Goal attainment is also improved in the long run: leadership development among the clients is a goal by itself, and the strengthening of client independence will lead to the better preservation of any other outputs achieved.",3
693,"The clients get satisfaction from participation (or, perhaps, participate as a result of their satisfaction), take part in a learning process which enriches them, and identify with a process in which they themselves are involved.",3
694,"They achieve declared or undeclared goals: involvement, legitimization, recognition, prestige, all of which increase their influence among the others in the client system and those in external systems, thus increasing the chances of further and better outputs in the future.",3
695,"The administration and the external political and administrative establishment may see participation as a political end in itself, a means to building coalitions for the political good of their establishment.",3
696,"If participation saves resources (jobs carried out by volunteers, , paid workers), then this is an important output, the public legitimization and support which are likely to accompany client participation.",3
697,"This, then, is the model which seems to us most appropriate for attempting empirically to answer our question: How can we measure the effects of client participation on the effectiveness of social work intervention?",3
698,"Using the six measurement criteria summarized at the end of the section on client participation, we are able to measure the extent to which our clients are participating in the community work project (the independent variable), and the model presented in this section allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of the project (the dependent variable) in a number of different ways.",3
699,CONCLUSION,3
700,In this article we have reviewed the extensive literature on client participation and effectiveness and the limited literature in which the effect of the former on the latter was examined.,3
701,"With the help of this previous research, we propose criteria for the measurement of these two important variables and an operative model to illustrate and to measure how participation can lead to effectiveness.",3
702,"We hope that improved methodology will allow a better evaluation of the relationship between two extremely important values in the social worker's day to day work, and will show that the participation of our clients is not just ideologically based but practically worthwhile.",3
703,"General Practice, Social Work, and Mental Health Sections: The Social Control of Women MICHAEL SHEPPARD",3
704,Michael Sheppard trained in social work at the University of East Anglia and was a social worker in Norfolk Social Services Department.,3
705,"His publications include (University of Sheffield Press, 1990) and (Falmer, 1991).",3
706,SUMMARY,3
707,A survey was undertaken of all referrals for compulsory admission received by a city mental health centre over a one year period.,3
708,The centre receives the overwhelming majority of all these referrals in the city.,3
709,Referrals from GPs were compared with other referrals focusing particularly on women.,3
710,"The results indicate GPs discriminated against women, referring considerably more women than men with less emphasis on major (psychotic) mental illness.",3
711,"The involvement of approved social workers (ASWs) in the assessment process was associated with diversion of many of the women compulsory admission, although even they appeared affected by patriarchal assumptions.",3
712,GPs behaviour sections is consistent with reports about sexist practice in other areas of work.,3
713,"This, however, is particularly grave with sections civil liberties implications.",3
714,"The article concludes that ASWs need be aware of potential sexist GP practice, that their psychosocial perspective is critical to assessment and that ASW training should include gender issues.",3
715,Researchers are beginning to unravel some of the factors significant in the process of assessment for compulsory admission (section assessments) under the 1983 Mental Health Act.,3
716,"Studies have focused on Approved Social Workers (ASWs)(Sheppard, 1990; Barnes .,",3
717,"1990) and the police (Bean .,",3
718,"1989; Bean, 1990; Rogers, 1989).",3
719,"One study has used theoretical and empirical research to provide the foundations for a social work knowledge base assessing social risk (Sheppard, 1990).",3
720,"There has, however, been no focus on the position of GPs and their interaction with ASWs in the assessment process.",3
721,"This article examines general practitioners (GPs) as referrers, and women as the subject of referral for section under the 1983 Act.",3
722,It does so by examining the process of assessment in which the ASW plays a critical role between the initial referral from the GP and the decision to section the woman.,3
723,"This is interesting, both the serious consequences of a mental health section, and concern expressed about sexist practice by GPs in other areas of their work (Barrett and Roberts, 1978; Cooperstock, 1978).",3
724,GPs occupy a pivotal position mental health.,3
725,"Because they occupy key positions in primary care, they are for most people the most accessible caring profession, and psychiatry is considered by doctors to be primarily their occupational territory.",3
726,"Hence they deal with high levels of psychiatric morbidity (Jenkins .,",3
727,"1988; Goldberg and Huxley, 1980).",3
728,"They are likely, therefore, to be the first profession approached by, , relatives, for assessment.",3
729,In many circumstances GPs are likely to be the first professional to decide a section is necessary and initiate the section assessment process subsequently involving ASWs.,3
730,"It is widely recognized that the proportion of women who suffer mental disorders — particularly depression — exceeds that of men (Cochrane, 1983).",3
731,"A variety of possible contributing factors have been put forward: that biological factors make women more vulnerable than men; that women are socially disadvantaged by the roles they are expected to perform, and psychologically disadvantaged by socialization preparing them for these roles; that women express their emotions more readily; and that health professionals are more likely to equate feminine characteristics with ill health (Weissman and Klerman, 1977; Penfold and Walker, 1984; Corob, 1987).",3
732,Feminists make much of the social disadvantage under which women suffer.,3
733,"this disadvantage, and possible GP sexism, the study of GP section referrals and the influence of ASWs in the subsequent process of assessment is significant.",3
734,Compulsory admission in England and Wales is carried out under the Mental Health Act 1983.,3
735,"This is primarily carried out under sections 2, 3, and 4, although section 5 provides for doctor and nurse holding powers, police powers exist under section 136 and courts have powers to direct individuals into hospital (, section 37).",3
736,"Section 2 involves admission for assessment, section 4 for emergency admission for assessment and section 3 for admission for treatment.",3
737,"Admission under these sections, , may be made when a person is suffering from a mental disorder, and such admission is in the interests of the person's (defined as patient) own health or safety or for the protection of other persons.",3
738,"The duration of section 2 may be 28 days and of section 3 six months, although it is renewable.",3
739,"Section 4 may last  72 hours, and may be made only when admission is of urgent necessity and complying with the provisions of section 2 would cause undesirable delay.",3
740,"Application may be made by an ASW or nearest relative although the draft code of practice (Department of Health, 1989) states the former should apply whenever possible.",3
741,"Sections 2 and 3 require two medical recommendations, one by an approved doctor, while section four requires only one.",3
742,Individuals may also be admitted informally (section 131) or not admitted .,3
743,"There is, therefore, a variety of possible outcomes following a referral.",3
744,METHOD,3
745,"The research was undertaken on referrals received by the Psychiatric Advisory Service (PAS) at the Nuffield Mental Health Centre in a medium sized city of about 240,000, with a very small ethnic minority population.",3
746,The Centre is situated in a central location with good transport links to all parts of the city.,3
747,The PAS is well known in the city and receives the overwhelming majority of the section assessment requests received during normal working hours.,3
748,It is staffed by a team of community psychiatric nurses and a team of social workers together with psychiatrists approved under the Act.,3
749,It is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.,3
750,Referrals at other times are received by hours social workers.,3
751,Referrals received from all sources requesting a section assessment over a one year period were included in this study.,3
752,"When the ASWs responded to a section referral, whatever the source, they were asked to complete fully structured questionnaires.",3
753,These had been developed over a one year period and had been fully piloted.,3
754,"Detailed analysis both of the questionnaires and piloting is provided elsewhere (Sheppard, 1990; 1991).",3
755,"The research instruments involved questions about the source of referral, section requested and psychiatric state suggested, if any, in the referral.",3
756,"They involved demographic characteristics age, sex, and marital status; information on psychiatric state and psychiatric disorder; and social problems.",3
757,"Finally, information was provided on who in the patient's social circle was interviewed as part of the assessment process, factors considered in assessment, and outcome.",3
758,"These data, it should be remembered, were provided by the ASW, and in some respects, the presence of social problems, will represent their perspective on the patient.",3
759,"In other respects, outcome, we have unambiguously objective information.",3
760,These questionnaires were completed within the week following assessment.,3
761,"Agency records, which  recorded all referrals, were checked weekly to confirm that ASWs had completed questionnaires where relevant.",3
762,RESULTS,3
763,MALE AND FEMALE REFERRALS,3
764,Altogether 120 referrals were made during the study year.,3
765,Forty (33 ) were by GPs.,3
766,"Of the other 80 referrals 17 were by the family, 13 by psychiatrists, 17 other health referrals, 15 police, nine social workers and nine other referrals.",3
767,"The overall rate of referral was 49.9 per 100,000 population, and for GPs, 16.6 per 100,000.",3
768,"These figures relate to referrals during working hours only, and compare with overall referral rates varying between 19.9 and 102.7 per 100,000 in 42 social services departments studied by Barnes .",3
769,(1990).,3
770,"Although, therefore, quite high, the rate of referral in this study was well within the range for different areas.",3
771,Seventy-five referrals (62 ) were women.,3
772,This is consistent with trends identified by Barnes .,3
773,"(1990), and raises issues of what, if any, social processes are occurring which leave women more frequently identified as candidates for sections.",3
774,The social profile of the women differed markedly from that of the men in a number of respects.,3
775,Men tended to be younger than women: 58 of men compared with 49 of women were aged under 45.,3
776,A number of differences are significant.,3
777,Table 1 shows significant differences in marital status.,3
778,"Markedly more men than women were single, while considerably more women were married or cohabiting.",3
779,"More women than men had children, although the small proportion of men with children confirms their limited involvement in family relationships.",3
780,Men were more disadvantaged in other ways.,3
781,Only 43 of women were unemployed or in families where no member was employed compared with 56 of men (p=0.024).,3
782,Sixty-seven of men compared with 42 of women were on state benefit excluding child benefit and retirement pension (universal to parents and the retired elderly)(p=0.013).,3
783,"Housing condition also showed greater, but not significant, male disadvantage.",3
784,"When divided into two — stable residence consisting of council and owner occupied housing, and unstable consisting of private rented, lodging, and hostel accommodation and no fixed abode — 76 of women lived in stable accommodation compared with 63 of men.",3
785,"Marked differences, however, are not evident in the ‘processing, of these people.",3
786,"Eighty-nine of men and 84 of women were previously known to the psychiatric services, indicating longstanding problems.",3
787,In just over half male and female referrals no specific mental disorder was identified.,3
788,Following the section assessment 84 of males and 95 of females were considered to suffer some kind of mental disorder.,3
789,"Over 70 of both groups were considered psychotic, with rather more men schizophrenic and rather more women suffering affective psychosis.",3
790,"Frequently, then, an unspecific referral was subsequently considered a psychosis.",3
791,On average the ASWs identified more social problems for women (2.12 per case) than men (1.6 per case).,3
792,"Twenty women (27 ) but only five men (11 ) had marital problems, while only one man (2 ) compared with ten women (13 ) had child care problems, both differences show just below significance (taken as p<0.05).",3
793,"Women, then, had more social problems, particularly connected with familial responsibilities.",3
794,"Outcome (Table 2) was generally similar for both groups, although considerably more men were placed on section 3 and rather more women on section 2.",3
795,"The former, which is more draconian, may reflect the longer term perceived treatment needs of the men.",3
796,This may be related to a relative lack of social stability: being more frequently single and in less permanent accommodation.,3
797,"Overall, then, the main differences were in the social profile, and a greater number of social problems in women.",3
798,Difference in outcome may be related to different social profiles.,3
799,This still leaves the issue of the process by which more women were referred.,3
800,WOMEN AND GP REFERRALS,3
801,The impact of GPs on the sex composition of referrals is profound (Table 3).,3
802,Exactly a third of referrals were made by GPs.,3
803,"However, the overwhelming majority of GP referrals were women, compared with only just over half the other referrals.",3
804,Indeed GP referrals account for nearly all the excess of female over male referrals.,3
805,"Examination of outcome, furthermore, is intriguing.",3
806,"The difference between male and female GP referrals was noticeable: five of the eight males referred (63 ) were sectioned, compared with only 12 (38 ) of female referrals.",3
807,"However, compared with the 70 of women referred from other sources (39) who were sectioned, the number of female GP referrals sectioned was significantly lower (p=0.011).",3
808,"This indicates a significantly greater diversion of women, following ASW assessment, generally with a psychiatrist, compulsory admission when referred by GPs.",3
809,An excess of GP referrals over other referrals of women informally admitted was matched by an excess of female over male GP referrals who were informally admitted.,3
810,Two initial observations may be made.,3
811,"This combination of data — an excess of GP over other referrals of women, together with a significantly greater likelihood of diversion of women referred by GPs compulsory admission compared with other female referrals — suggests apparent discrimination GPs against women.",3
812,"Second, the role of specialist  professionals — ASWs and psychiatrists — appears significant in enabling women referred by GPs to avoid compulsory admission.",3
813,Outcome is shown in more detail in Table 4.,3
814,This shows a noticeable excess of women referred by GPs over other female referrals who were not admitted .,3
815,Informal admissions are also interesting.,3
816,Noticeably more women referred by GPs were admitted informally than either male GP referrals or other female referrals.,3
817,"This group involves women who were considered to need assessment or treatment, but where compulsion was not considered necessary.",3
818,"This suggests the significance of specialist workers in two possible ways: either preventing compulsion where there was insufficient risk to the patient or others, or persuading those who would otherwise have been sectioned to enter hospital informally.",3
819,"Bean's (1980) typology of doctor — patient interaction showed that, under the 1959 Act, voluntary admission occurred when there was agreement between doctor and patient on the patient's sick role or where, although agreement did not exist, the patient acquiesced and accepted this role.",3
820,Compulsory admission occurred where the doctor ascribed the sick role but the patient did not accept it or did not react .,3
821,"The nature of the ASW involvement suggests that they too would be involved in this process (Sheppard, 1990).",3
822,Referrals by GPs where outcome was informal admission were consistently characterized by familial disruption: indeed only two of these cases were referred where the woman's behaviour drew attention to her in the wider social environment outside the family.,3
823,"The noticeable familial disruption occurring in other cases is particularly interesting because it reflects social role expectations of women, where the primary role is that of homemaker, family manager, and housewife (Oakley, 1981).",3
824,"Thus, informal admissions were characterized by a combination of mental ill health and transgression of traditional social role expectations.",3
825,"Three examples, drawn from the ASWs’ account, indicate the different types of familial disruption.",3
826,The first type —— involved a woman in her thirties who was considered to be   suffering from schizophrenia.,3
827,She was very overactive and had not slept for three nights.,3
828,"She was pacing up and down in the house, was hostile to other family members and was shouting at voices that she (and no-one else) heard.",3
829,"She was paying little attention to her normal ‘household duties’ child care, shopping, and looking after the house.",3
830,"She had two young children, aged five and seven, and the ASW expressed concern for their welfare.",3
831,"Her husband, who usually worked 200 miles away, had been forced to return to look after the children.",3
832,The second example — a woman considered to be depressed — involved from her usual role.,3
833,"In this case, a 45 year old woman with a large family had recently moved into the area.",3
834,She was described as having become ‘withdrawn and introverted’.,3
835,She was not going out and was communicating very little with her immediate family.,3
836,"She had two adult children who lived nearby, and had stopped visiting them as was her usual custom.",3
837,"She had stopped undertaking her usual tasks within the home, was eating very little and had taken to her bed a few days previously and had not re-emerged.",3
838,The third example involved .,3
839,This was a woman in her twenties who was considered to be schizophrenic.,3
840,"There was, the ASW, a ‘continuing crisis at home’.",3
841,"She had suffered paranoid delusions for a number of months, that the house was electronically ‘bugged’, that there was a camera in the television watching her and that she was being followed.",3
842,Her husband was described as having difficulty coping with her.,3
843,She had left home and was refusing to return the ‘weird things’ that were going on.,3
844,"When her husband tried to reason with her she refused to accept what he was saying, and had begun to suspect that he was involved in some way (in the bugging).",3
845,The lack of section 4 admissions was the availability of an approved doctor at the Centre: the approved doctor is frequently the most difficult of the two doctors to get hold of under sections 2 or 3.,3
846,"There was, amongst those sectioned, considerably less use of section 3 among women referred by GPs than either male GP referrals or other referrals of women.",3
847,"It is not immediately obvious why this should be the case, but this provides evidence of a less restrictive response to GP referrals of women, since section 3 applies for six months and section 2 for 28 days.",3
848,Section 2 is for assessment and may more frequently be expected where an individual had no previous psychiatric history.,3
849,"However, the proportion of men and women previously known to the psychiatric services was exactly the same (84 ) for both GP and other referrals.",3
850,"Overall then, not only were female GP referrals sectioned less frequently than other female referrals, but when sectioned they were less frequently the lengthier section 3.",3
851,PROBLEMS,3
852,We can explore these differences further problems.,3
853,"Individuals' psychiatric state was divided into ‘definite cases’, ‘borderline or threshold cases’, and ‘not cases’, where no psychiatric disorder was present.",3
854,The ASW was asked which of these were considered applicable to the assessed individual.,3
855,Few differences emerged between the relevant groups: 88 of male and 84 of female GP referrals plus 86 of other female referrals were considered definite.,3
856,"There was a tendency, however, for female GP referrals to involve less major mental illness than others, although differences were not significant.",3
857,"The individual diagnostic categories were broadly divided into three: neurotic, psychotic, and alcohol or drug problems, which could be neurotic or psychotic.",3
858,Of those considered mentally ill rather more female GP referrals (23 ) than other female referrals (8 ) and no male GP referrals were considered neurotic.,3
859,"All male mentally ill GP referrals were psychotic, as were 82 of other female referrals, compared with 77 of GP female referrals.",3
860,"The concept of primary problem was used by the ASW to identify, from the whole range of psychiatric and social problems noted in each case, which was considered to be the main or primary problem.",3
861,"There was a slight tendency for GPs' female referrals to have fewer psychiatric primary problems: 78 , compared with 86 of other women and 88 of male GP referrals.",3
862,"Psychotic primary problems also had a slightly lower profile amongst female GP referrals: only 60 came into this category, compared with 74 of other females although similar to male GP referrals (62.5 ).",3
863,Social problems were divided into thirteen categories.,3
864,The ASWs were asked to indicate which of these each individual suffered and which of these they considered to be severe.,3
865,Female GP referrals averaged 2.28 social problems compared with 2 for other women and 1.87 for male GP referrals.,3
866,"While, however, female GP referrals averaged more severe social problems per case (1.34) than male GP referrals (1.12), this was less than other female referrals (1.44).",3
867,"Nonetheless, there appears to be a different ‘threshold’ which triggers GP female referrals compared with other referrals, with greater emphasis on neurotic problems, fewer psychiatric primary problems and more social problems  than other referrals.",3
868,"GPs, therefore, more frequently resorted to section referrals for women with neurotic and social problems than is evident in other referrals.",3
869,"The pattern of social and mental health problems indicates GPs were more sensitized to mental health and illness, and that this played a significant part in choice of referral.",3
870,"The more frequent presence of social problems among female GP referrals is interesting here because these might be expected to raise the possibility of alternative referral (, to a social worker) and management.",3
871,"However, these GPs seemed to be seeking a medical solution to these women's problems.",3
872,"Second, the solution they sought had serious implications for civil liberties since sections would effectively deprive individuals of their liberty.",3
873,"This search for a medical solution, then, may present a serious threat to civil liberties.",3
874,We may pursue this through a further examination of primary problem.,3
875,"The detailed classifications of mental health and social problems were divided into six: neurotic, psychotic, alcohol — drugs for mental health; and practical, emotional and relationship, and physical ill health for social problems (Fitzgerald, 1978).",3
876,"Amongst GP referrals, seven (22 ) of the women, but no men had emotional or relationship problems as primary.",3
877,"These involved marital, loss or separation, social relations or isolation, and criminal behaviour problems.",3
878,"Although not significant, only women had relationship primary problems.",3
879,"However, this is particularly interesting when related to outcome.",3
880,No woman with emotional or relationship primary problems was sectioned.,3
881,"Indeed, six of the seven women falling into this category were not admitted , and one was admitted informally.",3
882,"In contrast only 15 of all other GP referrals (and 12 of other female referrals) were not admitted, while over half were sectioned.",3
883,"This suggests GPs were attempting to deal, both medically and compulsorily, and only in the case of women, with problems which at subsequent assessment were considered to be primarily about social relationships.",3
884,CONSULTING OTHERS,3
885,"One expectation of the ASW is that others in the patient's social network — relatives, friends, neighbours — should be consulted to help build a picture of the individual and their behaviour (DHSS, 1983; Department of Health, 1989).",3
886,"When women were referred by GPs, others were consulted significantly more frequently (88 ) than women who were referred by other referrers (61 )(p=0.02).",3
887,This may be because the GP's previous contact with the family facilitated such contact or that a balance to the GP's assessment was  sought.,3
888,In relation specifically to GP's referrals others were consulted with exactly the same frequency whether male or female referrals.,3
889,"Consulting others, furthermore, had no impact on outcome, consultation occurring in 88 of sectioned and 87 of not sectioned GP referrals.",3
890,"However, did the person consulted have an impact on outcome? , what was the impact of male family members?",3
891,Table 5 shows significant differences in outcome for women a male family member was consulted by the ASW.,3
892,Women not admitted were markedly more likely to have a male family member consulted.,3
893,"Where sections were undertaken, males were more frequently consulted where section 2 was undertaken than section 3.",3
894,"The picture was similar sectioned women where female family members were consulted, but interestingly females were not generally consulted where women were not admitted.",3
895,"Consulting both male and female family members was therefore associated with briefer section periods, but only males were associated with non admission.",3
896,"Indeed, in relation specifically to women not admitted, the difference between male and female members consulted was significant (p=0.034).",3
897,"There were also significant differences between GP and other referrals, specifically women not admitted.",3
898,"Of the nine women referred by GPs who were not admitted, eight cases (89 ) involved consultation with a male family member.",3
899,"Of the eight other women not admitted only two cases (25 ) involved consulting a male family member (Fisher exact probability test: one tail 0.013, two tail 0.015).",3
900,"There was little difference, however, between GP and other   referrals in the rate of male or female consultation section 2 and in female consultation non admissions.",3
901,"These data indicate that consultation with either male or female family members can have the effect on women sectioned, of producing less lengthy compulsory admission.",3
902,"It indicates also, however, that male family members can have an impact on non admission where females do not, and that this was significantly greater with GP referrals.",3
903,"This suggests, perhaps, two possibilities.",3
904,"The mere availability of a family male is reassuring, giving the ASWs and others assessing greater confidence that the woman can remain in the community.",3
905,"Second, the male family members, because they are male, are given a credibility — and hence power — to influence non admission not given to female members.",3
906,"However, this power is primarily relevant to GP referrals.",3
907,"This strongly indicates that it is only males who have the status and power to provide, in the eyes of the relevant professionals, a credible challenge to the GP.",3
908,"The Memorandum to the Act (DHSS, 1983) indicates a number of factors to be taken into account by ASWs.",3
909,"The woman's past history of mental disorder, family relations and support and medical opinion were all considered both with GP and other referrals in a minimum of 93 of cases.",3
910,"The woman's financial and material circumstances were considered less frequently with GP referrals (28 ) than other referrals (49 ) as was the case with non familial social supports (GP referrals 53 , other referrals 65 ).",3
911,"The referred woman's wishes were, however, considered more frequently in GP (78 ) than other referrals (63 ).",3
912,"Although these differences were not significant, there was less concentration on social factors relating to wider social supports and financial-material circumstances with GP referrals, suggesting, in the face of the GP's referral, and despite section diversions, less preparedness by ASWs to examine social factors which may challenge the GP's definition.",3
913,What power did the woman herself have to influence the course of events?,3
914,Table 6 shows the relationship between outcome and the extent to which their wishes were considered.,3
915,This shows significant differences: women's wishes were taken into account most frequently   when they were informally admitted or not admitted.,3
916,"Interestingly, women's wishes were more frequently considered with the longer section 3 than section 2 admissions (15 of 17 cases compared with 15 of 23 cases).",3
917,"Taken together with consultation with family members, this suggests that, when sectioned, family members had a greater impact on the length of admission.",3
918,"However, there was little difference between GP and other referrals where women were not sectioned.",3
919,Only one of the 20 women referred by GPs did not have her wishes considered.,3
920,The wishes of not admitted women referred by others were in all cases considered.,3
921,The trend was similar with men.,3
922,"These data suggest that, for both men and women, outcome significantly depended on whether their wishes were considered, or, alternatively, that their wishes were taken more seriously in less serious cases.",3
923,In either situation the mental health state of the woman may be significant.,3
924,PROFILE OF FEMALES REFERRED,3
925,What of the social profile of women referred?,3
926,Women referred by GPs were generally younger than other women: 59 of GP and 42 of other referrals were aged between 16 and 44.,3
927,More women referred by GPs were married (47 ) or single (28 ) than other referrals (35 married and 19 single).,3
928,"However, 22 of GP referrals and 42 of other referrals were widowed, divorced, or separated, and hence had lost their partner.",3
929,Rather more (28 ) women referred by GPs than other women referred (12 ) had children.,3
930,About three quarters of both groups lived in owner occupied or council housing.,3
931,"Rather fewer GP referrals of working age (54 ) lived in a unit with no employed members than other referrals (65 ), while fewer GP (33 ) than other women referred (48 ) received state benefit child or retirement benefit.",3
932,"GP referrals only, more women (59 ) than men (38 ) were aged 16 to 44 and more women (63 ) than men (43 ) were in more stable council or owner occupied housing.",3
933,"More men (57 ) than women (28 ) were single, and more women (47 ) than men (29 ) were married.",3
934,Only one man (13 ) had children compared with nine women (28 ).,3
935,The proportion unemployed was similar.,3
936,"Although differences are not significant the overall profile indicates that female GP referrals were more frequently married, aged between 16 and 44, had children, and lived in more stable housing.",3
937,"GPs were using section referrals as a method of social control, it was more frequently upon these women.",3
938,DISCUSSION,3
939,"The difficulty of research in this area has meant that, with one notable exception (Barnes .,",3
940,"1990) very large scale studies have not been undertaken, whether on the 1959 or 1983 Acts.",3
941,"It is also relevant that these were referrals to one mental health centre, although the lack of ASWs in district teams meant that these represented practically all the daytime referrals to ASWs.",3
942,"Although we must recognize the limits of a study focusing on one city, the results are, perhaps, startling, and of considerable interest.",3
943,The pattern of results raises major concerns about the role of GPs in using section referrals as a method of social control of women.,3
944,Its significance lies in the seriousness of the consequences should a woman be inappropriately sectioned.,3
945,Enforced hospital entry would be accompanied by a loss of normal civil liberties.,3
946,Under section 2 or 3 this involves detention respectively 28 days or six months.,3
947,"They may be forced to take medication (mind altering drugs), although consent or a second opinion is required three months after the beginning of treatment (section 58).",3
948,"Although some protection is provided by appeal to the Mental Health Review Tribunal or nearest relative right to discharge, in practice both are rarely undertaken or successful, the total sectioned.",3
949,Referral for compulsory admission is clearly an issue of power.,3
950,"It involves generally male professionals (GPs) raising the issue of deprivation of liberty for women, frequently married and aged under 45, and, compared with other referrals, likely to have children.",3
951,"The excess of these women in GP referrals, it might be argued, represents the excess of women with children seen in general practice (Shepherd .,",3
952,1966).,3
953,"However, this fails to account for various other elements in the process of assessment.",3
954,"Following assessment, involving ASWs and, at times, approved doctors, fewer women then men referred by GPs or other women referred were actually hospitalized.",3
955,The incidence of informal admission was also higher in GP referred women.,3
956,"Although considered assessment or treatment, these women did not require compulsory admission, with the attendant limits on civil liberties.",3
957,"We may legitimately ask why, given GPs' professional concern with mental health, this should be the case to a greater extent than with other — frequently lay — referrals.",3
958,It strongly suggests that GPs' concern for civil liberties was considerably outweighed by their concern for treatment: a conceptual inability to distinguish between treatment need and treatment requirements combined with curtailment of civil liberties; something more sinister.,3
959,"The data indicate a connection between  adequate assessment of social factors and civil liberties, commented on elsewhere (Sheppard, 1990), and considered further later.",3
960,"They ascribe a significant role in this respect to mental health specialists, particularly ASWs.",3
961,The distribution of problems is also revealing.,3
962,"Women referred by GPs were more neurotic and less psychotic than the comparison groups, and had more social problems.",3
963,GPs showed a different threshold triggering their female compared with their male referrals.,3
964,More telling still is that where ASWs considered relationship problems primary no woman referred by GPs was sectioned.,3
965,"A further important aspect of the assessment process was the significance of ASW consultation with male family members, associated with section 2 more than section 3 and to a greater degree with GP than other referrals with non admission.",3
966,"This creates a strongly patriarchal image: of women as the hapless subjects where, in the face of the (professionally powerful) GP referral, it was through ASW consultation with males that a potential section was averted, or the duration of a section was shortened.",3
967,"A possible (relatively) benign explanation might be presented for GPs' failure to pursue a non compulsory route: that women, whose conventional role involves running the home and family, would be less willing to go into hospital precisely their feelings of responsibility for others in the home.",3
968,"However, the evidence contradicts this.",3
969,"First, of those not sectioned, a considerable proportion were not hospitalized : mentally ill, they were not, following assessment, seen to fit the criteria for compulsory admission.",3
970,"Second, there was a marked trend for (female) referrals by GPs subsequently considered to be about social relationships not to be sectioned.",3
971,"Indeed, overall women referred by GPs showed greater evidence of neurotic, psychotic, problems and a greater predominance of social problems.",3
972,GPs were clearly treating women differently and utilizing a different threshold or trigger for female referrals.,3
973,"Finally, of those informally admitted, the majority of women were contributing to the running of the household.",3
974,"They were either disruptive, or withdrawn, or simply not around to be involved in familial or household responsibilities.",3
975,"This is, , a not surprising by-product of some forms of mental illness and some women, despite this, might still argue that they were needed at home.",3
976,"However, a sympathetic and patient GP would not have required great imagination to point out the disparity between such claims by these women and their ability to perform family and household tasks based on the evidence of their behaviour.",3
977,"Certainly, if this was what was necessary, it did not subsequently prove beyond the wit of the ASW or psychiatrist to point this out.",3
978,"As one of the ‘specialists’ involved in assessment GP referral, ASWs clearly played a significant part in diverting these women from possible compulsory admission.",3
979,"To what extent, however, does this reflect the work specifically of the ASW the psychiatrist?",3
980,"First, ASWs took responsibility for decisions diverting individuals from compulsory admission.",3
981,"Where individuals referred by GPs were subsequently informally admitted or not admitted , in no case would the ASW have preferred compulsory admission.",3
982,"There is, furthermore, considerable evidence in this study of social factors being of some significance.",3
983,This is most clearly the case in referrals where relationship problems were considered primary and where no compulsory admission took place.,3
984,"Although we cannot be categorical the cases in this study, other research has indicated that psychiatrists rarely trouble themselves with the social circumstances of individuals referred, and are rather preoccupied with evidence of mental disorder (Bean, 1980).",3
985,"In this research social information, psychiatric diagnosis, was not considered by psychiatrists to be central to their task, although they were aware of the influence of social factors on psychiatric symptomatology.",3
986,"They therefore made little attempt, family history, income, education, and criminal history, to collect information on social circumstances.",3
987,"Although this research involved the 1959 Act, unlike social workers, additional training has not been required of psychiatrists under the 1983 Act.",3
988,"It is reasonable to suppose, therefore, that social factors influencing decision making, the ASW played an important part.",3
989,"Third, a number of significant dimensions analysed reflect, specifically, the ASW the medical role.",3
990,"This is particularly the case social and familial factors considered, and the members of the individual's social network interviewed, as part of the assessment process.",3
991,"Section 13 (2) of the Act specifically requires the ASW to consider ‘all the circumstances of the case’ and these factors were specifically mentioned in the Memorandum (DHSS, 1983) as a guide to ASW assessment.",3
992,"Where, , members of the patient's social network were interviewed as part of the assessment process, these interviews were specifically carried out by the ASWs.",3
993,Finally the research is based on information collected from the ASWs themselves.,3
994,"Thus, , the definition of primary problem in each case comes from the ASWs, reflecting their perspectives on individuals assessed.",3
995,"To that extent the results reflect the basis upon which ASWs made decisions, which frequently involved diversion of GP referrals from compulsory admission.",3
996,"However, the ASW role was not wholly positive: ASWs were significant in diverting women from compulsory admission, and injecting a  psychosocial perspective which appears to have contributed to this diversion.",3
997,"Nonetheless, the significance of ASW consultation with male relatives, and a tendency to examine social factors which may have challenged GP definitions less than with other referrals are rather less positive.",3
998,These serious findings may be linked with other aspects of GP behaviour.,3
999,The first may be related specifically to GPs' training as medical practitioners.,3
1000,"Huntington (1981) identifies two significant elements of GP occupational culture: a biophysical (psychosocial) frame of reference, and an action (holding) orientation.",3
1001,"Although medical education may pay some attention to the social sciences in the pre-clinical curriculum, the highest priority is still overwhelmingly given to the ‘hard sciences’.",3
1002,"This bias is reflected in practice, where medicine's primary concern is with the biophysical consequences of diagnosis and treatment, not its social causes and consequences (Freidson, 1970).",3
1003,"The result is an emphasis on the subject matter of general practice as a biomedical phenomenon, concomitantly ignoring or minimizing the need for psychosocial knowledge or skills.",3
1004,"This, Huntington (1981) thinks, is allied to an action orientation: a predilection for ‘doing’ traceable back to teaching hospitals, where the dominant image of the emergency prevails.",3
1005,"The legacy in the GP is a tendency to take action for its own sake — doing something is better than doing nothing (Freidson, 1970).",3
1006,The potential for ill considered actions is great with sections.,3
1007,"Viewed from the subsequent assessment, GPs mostly correctly identified individuals with mental illness.",3
1008,"However, many were referred for compulsory admission where they were subsequently not admitted, or admitted informally.",3
1009,"In the latter case, could the GP not have discussed this with the individual first? why resort to possible compulsory powers?",3
1010,"Second, by resorting to a medical route (and a compulsory one at that) for dealing with problems of women, frequently having a major psychosocial element, their behaviour indicated a limited frame of reference for viewing these problems — a predominantly biophysical perspective.",3
1011,"Bean (1980), the 1959 Act, makes some points about psychiatrists which may be extended to GPs.",3
1012,He suggests that their orientation is towards the perceived therapeutic needs of the patient their legal rights.,3
1013,"This does not mean that legal rights are entirely ignored, but it does mean the scope for making decisions primarily based on illness is increased.",3
1014,"Sheppard (1990) has described a ‘mental health orientation’ in section assessments, with which the behaviour of these GPs is consistent.",3
1015,This involves the balance of emphasis placed on the mental health status of the patient versus the social risk they present (to the health or safety of  the patient or protection of others).,3
1016,A mental health orientation places greater emphasis on the former to the detriment of the latter.,3
1017,"This mental health orientation leads to a more pessimistic outlook on patient needs — they not only require treatment, but it is assumed that it must be compulsory — and there is a tendency towards a ‘presumption of risk’— that the presence of mental illness makes the situation inherently risky.",3
1018,"This is consistent with the behaviour of these GPs: placing mental illness to the fore when the problem may be primarily social, and seeking a compulsory voluntary route.",3
1019,"When ASWs made assessments, social factors frequently took a high profile, as social mental health problems were considered primary.",3
1020,"Where relationship problems were primary no women were sectioned, a mental health problem was present.",3
1021,"The injection of a more psychosocial perspective, therefore, diverted some women sections, and even informal hospitalization.",3
1022,There are also characteristics which show specific disadvantage to women.,3
1023,"It is the involvement of the ASW, and possibly the approved doctor, which rescues some women from possible compulsion.",3
1024,Why should GPs show discrimination against women? and why emphasize married women with children?,3
1025,"There is evidence of sex role stereotyping by mental health professionals, and GPs .",3
1026,Broverman .,3
1027,'s (1970) well known study showed that sex role stereotyping placed women in a disadvantageous position.,3
1028,Characteristics considered healthy for an adult (sex unspecified) were primarily those considered healthy for men those considered healthy for women.,3
1029,The healthy person was also the healthy man.,3
1030,"This leaves women in a catch 22 ‘whether to exhibit those positive characteristics considered desirable for men and adults and have their ‘femininity'’ questioned…or to behave in the prescribed feminine manner [and]accept second class adult status' (Broverman .,",3
1031,"1970, p. 6).",3
1032,"By implication, the healthy female is not the healthy adult.",3
1033,Some characteristics Broverman .,3
1034,"(1970) found identified by clinicians as characteristic of healthy women were: being more submissive, less adventurous, less objective, more emotional, more excitable in minor crises — strange characteristics for a healthy person!",3
1035,Yet these are reflections of popular expectations.,3
1036,Penfold and Walker (1984) comment that a girl is trained to consider her primary achievement is to be a wife and mother.,3
1037,"She is led to believe that she will be happy and fulfilled if she serves others, devoting herself to the needs of her husband and children.",3
1038,"She provides for the physical needs of the family, she is its emotional organizer, mediator of feelings, with a responsibility to dampen and absorb confrontations and generally keep the family running smoothly.",3
1039,"The GP in this social world — far from being an expert — is no more than a layperson, with the same prejudices as others.",3
1040,"Barrett and Roberts (1978) showed how GPs tended to see middle aged women patients primarily their family, and men primarily their occupation.",3
1041,"Where a woman fails to perform her expected role properly the GP tends to see her ‘either the conventional models of their own social background (she must adjust to her situation), or individual personal inadequacy (that she must be referred to the psychiatrist)’(Barrett and Roberts, 1978, p. 46).",3
1042,"However, extensive research shows that the stereotypically female role of mother, other social disadvantage, is actually associated with vulnerability to depression and broader distress (Brown and Harris, 1978; Richman, 1974, 1976; Moss and Plavis, 1977).",3
1043,The relative emphasis on neuroses in female GP referrals is interesting in this context.,3
1044,The problem appears in medicine's successful expansion of its empire.,3
1045,"Doctors are consulted on environmental, technical, religious, or psychiatric matters, which are frequently beyond the scope of medical education.",3
1046,"Since medical advice has the force of moral imperative, health and illness are concepts expanding to ever increasing parts of human existence (Zola, 1975).",3
1047,The effect is the creation of doctors as social control agents.,3
1048,Two levels may be identified from previous discussions.,3
1049,"First, there is advice maintaining an unrewarding and demoralizing existence.",3
1050,Barrett and Roberts (1978) found GPs extensively ‘smoothed away surface anxieties’(p. 42) and adjusted women to a life located totally in the home.,3
1051,"In so doing they legitimated and endorsed the , and fulfilled an ideological function of agent of disguised social control.",3
1052,Doctors frequently used their medical-moral language to offer a set of prescriptions based ‘on the conventional wisdom of their own social milieu’(p. 42).,3
1053,The second level of social control relates to the use of drugs.,3
1054,The use of psychotropic drugs is a pervasive dimension of the medicalization of problems of living.,3
1055,"These drugs are prescribed in vast quantities, and far more frequently for women than men (Cooperstock, 1978).",3
1056,"Valium is a case in point (Koumjian, 1981): an extensively prescribed drug to deal with anxiety and stress.",3
1057,"It can, however, have severe withdrawal symptoms, including dizziness, nausea, vomiting, panic, anxiety and depression.",3
1058,"Valium prescription is frequently related to an individual's social functioning: the person's ability to live social ideals, social expectations and the physician's judgement are factors in a pseudo objective diagnosis.",3
1059,"Valium, therefore, is frequently prescribed for problems loneliness and marital discord, the latter interestingly considerably more evident in female than male section referrals in our study.",3
1060,"Valium use, furthermore, focuses on individual malfunctioning: social and economic problems are dealt with in a framework of a medical model of relief of individual distress, alleviating symptoms operating in a social context which may require familial or wider social change.",3
1061,"Indeed, the conditions of medical practice support these approaches.",3
1062,The lack of emphasis on psychosocial factors in training leaves GPs without sensitivity or skills in these areas.,3
1063,"Second, lack of time is a factor.",3
1064,"There is clear advantage — time use — in prescribing drugs engaging in more time consuming counselling, or confronting the social origins of the problems.",3
1065,"Anyway, GPs are not trained for either of these.",3
1066,"Finally, advertising of tranquillizers has provided an explicit message: to use drugs in controlling conflict, producing a less demanding and more compliant patient, or for dealing with life crises or social problems.",3
1067,"A third, and more sinister, level of social control has been identified here: the use of compulsory admission.",3
1068,This takes medical ideology to an extreme point.,3
1069,There is an unequal knowledge relationship between GP and patient — the GP is expert and ‘definer’ of the patient's problem.,3
1070,The balance of power is also unequal in that GPs exert pressure for compulsory admission of women who could otherwise be admitted informally.,3
1071,This involves a medical solution GPs seek medical care in a hospital environment.,3
1072,"Finally, such medical care will generally involve invasive drug therapy.",3
1073,Our evidence suggests section referrals may be used by GPs as an extreme form of social control of women.,3
1074,"It also indicates that specialists, particularly ASWs, play a significant role in preventing unnecessary sections, hence guarding women's civil rights.",3
1075,"Even they, however, were not unaffected by patriarchal assumptions.",3
1076,"We have here further evidence of the need for ASWs to assume a social risk mental health orientation (Sheppard, 1990).",3
1077,"ASWs are, by their training, the best equipped to examine social dimensions of section assessments.",3
1078,"Given the apparent pervasiveness of GPs' behaviour, it is vital, given their primary training in the complexity of the social world, that, first, ASWs are aware of issues of gender and sexism, and second that they are prepared to challenge medical power threatening women's civil rights.",3
1,HOW TO RECOGNIZE FOSSILS,4
2,Fossils are not rare.,4
3,"We have seen how millions of fossils may make up the rocks themselves, crammed together layer after layer to form formations thousands of feet thick.",4
4,The present land surface is a thin skin a thick record of the past preserved in the rocks.,4
5,Once scientists began to collect the record of past life they soon came across the problem of how to order and arrange the huge variety of fossil forms they recovered.,4
6,"to understand what they had found they needed to classify the fossil organisms into particular kinds, more or less similar, to impose an order on what would otherwise have been a vast and chaotic mass of different and apparently unrelated relics.",4
7,The urge to order the natural world appears to be an innate characteristic of human beings: ‘a place for everything and everything in its place’.,4
8,"But classifying animals and plants, living and fossil, is more than just an attempt to find a convenient way of slotting them into different categories, like stamps in a stamp album, for neatness and convenience.",4
9,The classification of the natural world is supposed to reflect the great ordering that itself gave rise to the variety and diversity of animals and plants that are alive today: the process of evolution.,4
10,"Animals that look similar are classified together, and not only that, they are also closely related in an evolutionary sense (or put another way, they share a common ancestor).",4
11,"So when we look at the grimacing gestures of a chimpanzee and wonder at the almost ludicrous parallels with our own behaviour this is just part of a whole host of behavioural and anatomical similarities that show without doubt that we ought to be classified with the apes (we are all of us primates), and that we share a distant ancestor with our diminutive caricatures.",4
12,"Evolution has driven man and the chimpanzee further our shared ancestral species, and in evolutionary terms the chimpanzee is as advanced as we are, although man dominates by virtue of numbers and adaptability.",4
13,"Few people are offended today, as they were in the last century, by the thought of man and the chimpanzee being classified together by virtue of a common ancestor which has been extinct for probably three million years!",4
14,But enough family likeness remains to make the chimpanzees' tea-time a most popular attraction in zoos all over the world.,4
15,A word of caution here: not similarities indicate relationships with evolutionary significance.,4
16,"Some similarities can be misleading, because animals can superficially resemble that are not closely related in an evolutionary sense.",4
17,Often these resemblances are the product of a similar mode of life.,4
18,"Both tortoises and armadillos are animals that carry around their own suit of armour, and at first glance we might think they were related.",4
19,"But further investigation shows that tortoises are cold-blooded reptiles that lay eggs, while armadillos are in many respects typical warm-blooded mammals bearing their young alive.",4
20,Obviously tortoises and armadillos cannot be classified together their similarities.,4
21,When classifying fossils even more care is necessary because we have not got as much evidence to go on as with living animals.,4
22,We cannot see directly whether a fossil animal was warm or cold-blooded when alive; often the evidence is indirect and depends on careful study of little bits of bone.,4
23,The palaeontologist is like a detective trying to reconstruct a full story from a few  fragmentary clues.,4
24,He must be careful not to follow any ‘red herrings’ that will result in him classifying his fossil on the basis of ambiguous similarities.,4
25,"He must distinguish snakes from eels, tortoises from armadillos, on the basis of the bones presented to him.",4
26,"To do this, he must have thorough familiarity with the living fauna, because the information on living animals is so much more complete.",4
27,We shall see in the next chapter how carrying comparisons with living animals far can result in curious and inaccurate pictures of the past.,4
28,Distantly related species may come to resemble closely.,4
29,"Slow worm (), snake () and amphisbaenid (), probably all descended from different ancestors, and reached their similar shapes along separate evolutionary pathways.",4
30,"The number of species of animals and plants living today runs into millions, and similar numbers of species have probably lived on earth for part of the earth's history.",4
31,"Perhaps it is fortunate that the fossil record preserved only a fraction of the truly stupendous total number of species that must have lived since the Cambrian, for otherwise the scientists' task to catalogue 600 million years of life would be an impossible one.",4
32,"It is not surprising that new fossil species are discovered daily, and indeed the amateur collector has a good chance of finding a new species of fossil, if he looks hard enough and learns to recognize what he has found.",4
33,"There must have been an increase in the number of different kinds of animals and plants since the Precambrian; , the conquering of land alone gave rise to a multitude of new opportunities for the colonizing organisms, resulting in an increase in the total number of species.",4
34,"Within the marine environment itself some palaeontologists believe that the overall richness of the marine fauna was established early on, say by the Silurian period, and that there has not been a great increase in the total number of species living in the sea at any one time since then, although the of organisms inhabiting the sea have changed many times.",4
35,"And there have been several major episodes of extinction (Chapter 6), when the cast of characters in the sea changed almost totally.",4
36,"Although the number of  species may have been approximately the same in marine environments for the last 300 million years or so the kinds of fossils have changed repeatedly, , , in marine limestones of Silurian age the shelled brachiopods may number dozens of species, whereas in similar looking limestones of Eocene age no brachiopods can be found, but there may be as many species of gastropods of kinds unknown in Silurian rocks.",4
37,"Even by the beginning of the Cambrian period, when fossils start to become easy to find and many different kinds of animals had acquired preservable hard parts, it is possible to classify the fossils found in the rocks into broadly similar groups.",4
38,"Nearly all of these groups correspond with major divisions of living animals, so the broad base of classification was established by the Cambrian.",4
39,"These major groups continued to evolve throughout the following 600 million years, and they include the distant ancestors of our living fauna.",4
40,"Not all the major living groups of organisms were present in the Cambrian, however, because the colonization of the land did not take place for another 200 million years, and so there were obviously no direct ancestors of land plants around, or of most of the land animals with which we are familiar today.",4
41,"The major groups into which we can fit almost all fossils from the Cambrian onwards, and all the living fauna, are called (singular:).",4
42,"To identify any animal properly, the first stage is to determine to which phylum it belongs.",4
43,"even the phyla themselves originated from unknown ancestors, and they all ultimately derived from the first living cell.",4
44,"Fossil evidence for some of this early history is shrouded in obscurity, hidden in the vast stretches of Precambrian time, but as is shown in Chapter 7 more evidence is being discovered each year.",4
45,Some of the answers are only now coming to light as we find out more about the structures of the proteins that go to make up living cells themselves.,4
46,"By the time organisms had become sophisticated enough to have hard parts, evolution had already defined the phyla, and the great natural framework for classification had been almost completely constructed.",4
47,At the opposite end of the scale from the phylum is the smallest unit of classification usually used for fossils: the .,4
48,"To be strictly accurate a species can be defined precisely only in living animals, where it refers to populations that can interbreed under natural conditions, and which produce offspring that are capable of further reproducing their kind.",4
49,"In practice, many species are recognized by having some peculiarity of shape, behaviour, plumage, colour , that reliably set them all other similar species.",4
50,"Obviously we shall never know whether fossil species were capable of interbreeding until somebody invents a time machine, and we can go back and see for ourselves!",4
51,"So our fossil species are defined in a rather practical way, as showing some consistent difference or differences from all other related species.",4
52,"the patchy nature of the fossil record many species (particularly of large vertebrate animals) are known from only one specimen; some of these are of almost inestimable value, which is why museums have to take good care of their material.",4
53,Every species has a unique scientific name.,4
54,"The species are ‘christened’ when a scientist describes them for the first time, illustrates their peculiarities and publishes the name in a scientific journal.",4
55,The species name has two words:is a familiar example.,4
56,"The names are usually derived from Latin or Greek —‘’ means ‘tyrant lizard’and ‘’‘king’so the animal is appropriately described as King of the tyrant lizards:is the , unique to this species.",4
57,"There may be other dinosaurs, which are similar to , but belong to another species.",4
58,These may be included in the same but will be given a different specific name.,4
59,"Some species are named after their collectors, so if our new species of were collected by a Mr Jones it might eventually be christened .",4
60,"Incidentally, the generic name always starts with a capital letter, and the specific name with a small one, it is named after Jones.",4
61,In this chapter typical examples of the kinds of fossils most commonly encountered are illustrated by beautiful specimens.,4
62,"Very few fossils have everyday names, and so the scientific name is used.",4
63,Once a few have been mastered it is surprising how quickly the most ponderous sounding scientific name acquires a familiar ring.,4
64,"The scientific name has the great advantage of being the same all over the world, so the language of nomenclature is a truly international one.",4
65,Between the species on the one hand and the phylum on the other there are a whole series of intermediate categories of increasing  inclusiveness.,4
66,"Several genera (plural of genus) may be grouped together in a , several families together in a , and the superfamilies themselves are clustered into , two or more of which combine to make the phylum.",4
67,"It all sounds rather complicated, but it does serve a useful function in ordering the almost countless number of species in the most economical way.",4
68,"All the species within any of the units of classification descended from a single, ancestral species.",4
69,"We need not worry about families or superfamilies in this book, but classes often correspond to everyday groups of animals.",4
70,"In the phylum Mollusca — the molluscs which include the majority of sea animals with shells — the class Gastropoda includes all the snails, and the class Bivalvia all the clams (mussels, scallops, etc.).",4
71,"Many of the most familiar fossils, like the trilobites, are classes within larger phyla.",4
72,"Plants are classified in much the same way as animals, but just to make things difficult the largest units of classification are not generally called phyla but ‘divisions’.",4
73,"Many of the plants familiar in the garden — Dahlia, Chrysanthemum, Fuchsia — are generic names which have come into common language.",4
74,The fossil record of plants is rather patchy compared with that of some animal phyla.,4
75,Partly this the broad level classification of plants is still being argued.,4
76,"We will now examine the commonest and most important kinds of fossils, the kinds that the reader will be able to find when he starts a collection.",4
77,"The groups of organisms described have certain special peculiarities that set them all others, and once these features are recognized the group to which the fossil belongs can be confidently identified.",4
78,"Each group is illustrated in the plates by a typical species, but all the groups contain many species, and any specimen the reader is likely to find will probably differ from the one chosen for illustration in several details.",4
79,"Most accounts of the different kinds of fossils start with the simplest organisms and work towards the most complex, often ending somewhat selfishly with man.",4
80,"This can give the impression of a simple evolutionary tree: single cells to many cells, shellfish to fish, and then land vertebrates.",4
81,This is not correct.,4
82,"Although single-celled organisms are obviously simpler than complex animals like ourselves, many single-celled organisms have continued to evolve actively since they lived in the ‘primaeval soup’.",4
83,"It is known that some of the unicellular organisms in the sea today are only one or two million years old (very little in geological terms), in fact they are probably as young as man himself!",4
84,Very simple and very complex organisms have lived side by side for a long time and both have evolved together.,4
85,"True ‘living fossils’ are really rather rare, and the term can be applied to both simple and highly complex organisms that have outlived the time when the earth was populated with many more of their kind.",4
86,"It is easier to describe simple organisms first and move on to complex ones but this is just a convenience of arrangement, and we will follow this procedure here.",4
87,"Some of the most important fossils are extremely tiny: these will be discussed in a later chapter, and what follows is concerned with the forms that can be recognized from hand specimens.",4
88,When they are first chipped the rock such fossils will often be partly concealed by matrix.,4
89,"To identify them it is usually essential to clean off most of the enclosing rock, otherwise one can be misled by superficial resemblance.",4
90,The rule is never to try such cleaning in the field — it nearly always results in a pile of rubble and a frayed temper.,4
91,THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF FOSSILS AND HOW TO RECOGNIZE THEM,4
92,SINGLE-CELLED ANIMALS — PROTOZOA (Colour plate 2),4
93,"A large and heterogeneous collection of organisms are grouped in the Protozoa, including all those animals that can lead an autonomous existence as a single cell.",4
94,"Most are microscopic, and many have no skeleton and therefore lack a fossil record.",4
95,"The flexible amoeba, which is the protoplasmic ‘blob’ of popular imagination, is a familiar protozoan without much potential for fossilization.",4
96,"A few protozoan groups secrete hard (shells) which are very common fossils, but again most of these are too small to be easily spotted in the field.",4
97,"They are of great geological importance, however, and we shall return to them later in this book.",4
98,Such testate protozoans have a record extending back to the Cambrian.,4
99,"A very few protozoans secrete skeletons of (for a single cell) gigantic size, and these also occur in such numbers that they form conspicuous and common fossils.",4
100,Particularly in rocks of Eocene age the coin-like are important as rock builders.,4
101,"Nummulites are  known from England, but they are most numerous in the Mediterranean and eastwards, where they form limestone formations of great thickness.",4
102,The pyramids of Egypt are constructed of limestone blocks in which the species is conspicuous (opposite p. 64).,4
103,"Nummulites are a giant kind of foraminiferan, an important group of rock-forming organisms as far back as the Carboniferous (and with ancestors in Cambrian rocks), and which still form deep sea oozes today.",4
104,Most foraminiferans require a microscope for their study.,4
105,Another group of giant foraminiferans flourished particularly in the Permian period: these are the ,4
106,"being about the size and shape of a coin, the fusulines are spindle-shaped, with a round cross-section tapering at both ends; fusuline limestones again form thick rock sequences, particularly in Russia and the Orient.",4
107,"Both fusulines and nummulites are divided into many small chambers internally, and details of their internal structure are used to classify them.",4
108,"Both groups seem to have flourished in exceptionally warm, shallow seas in the tropics of the Tethyan region.",4
109,"THE SPONGES — PHYLUM PORIFERA (Colour plates 1, 3)",4
110,"The sponges are an important group of many-celled organisms, with the individual cells specialized for particular functions but rather loosely aggregated.",4
111,Some sponges have the property of being able to ‘rebuild’ their colonies of cells if they are mashed up.,4
112,"Marine sponges have a long fossil record from the Cambrian onwards, and at many localities they are abundant enough to be important rock formers.",4
113,"They have been prominent reef-building organisms too, often bryozoans.",4
114,Not all sponges contain hard parts capable of being fossilized.,4
115,"The skeletal elements of those with hard parts are fine, often branching elements called .",4
116,"The spicules may be only loosely associated within the sponge tissues, or may be more or less fused to form rigid skeletons.",4
117,"Two major divisions of sponges are distinguished on the composition of the spicules: the glass sponges have a skeleton composed of silica, one of the few examples in nature where this material is used as a basis for a skeleton, while the calcareous sponges use calcium carbonate for their spicules.",4
118,"Both kinds have Cambrian representatives and both flourish today, the glass sponges being especially numerous in deep-sea environments.",4
119,"The sponge skeleton is highly variable in shape: many are cup or flask shaped, others spherical or cauliflower-like, while some form flat plates folded together, or are encrusting.",4
120,A successful group of sponges has taken to boring into the shells of other organisms.,4
121,"In detail, sponges are distinguished by the form of the spicular structure, and the ways these combine to form the skeleton, the overall shape.",4
122,"Although sponges are widely distributed in the fossil record they are particularly numerous and easy to collect in Cretaceous rocks in Europe and North America, where dozens of well-preserved species have been described.",4
123,"Sponges are often preserved inside flints, which were originally deposited as hard layers within the Cretaceous chalk.",4
124,"As they are much more resistant to weathering than the enclosing chalk, the flints remain behind when the chalk is eroded away.",4
125,"Flints containing sponges may be incorporated into younger sediments (they are then known as ), and it is not unusual for such flints to be dug up in suburban gardens around London — a long journey from the Cretaceous seas.",4
126,"The calcareous sponge from the Cretaceous of Berkshire, England.",4
127,"This sponge with a calcite skeleton was obtained from a gravel, an unusual type of rock in which to find fossils It is a broadly cup-shaped sponge, rapidly expanding from a narrow base.",4
128,"The minutely porous external surface is covered with irregular bumps. number of species of this genus have been reported from Cretaceous rocks, and related genera occur back to the Triassic.",4
129,"Species related to this one occur in France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland.",4
130,Sponges vary in size and shape.,4
131,The specimen shown has a height of 7 cm.,4
132,"Specimens from unconsolidated gravels are not difficult to clean, any adherent sand grains being easily removed using a stout pin.",4
133,"CORALS AND RELATED ANIMALS — PHYLUM COELENTERATA (Colour plates 4, 5, 6, 9)",4
