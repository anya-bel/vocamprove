1,BEING DRAWN TO AN IMAGE,1
2,Guy Brett,1
3,"Why do certain images matter to one, and why is the desire to answer this question as involuntary as the response itself?",1
4,"Why does it seem important that the answer should have some ‘objective’ quality about it, an insight into history, society, knowledge, point to a merely personal obsession?",1
5,"The American film-maker Maya Deren says somewhere that ‘response should always precede analysis’, a remark which sounds it was made as an artist's challenge to academic dryness and formalism.",1
6,"But is not the response and the analysis actually part of the same phenomenon, whether it results in an exclamation (‘how beautiful! ') or a new ‘reading’?",1
7,"The recourse to books, documents, or sources, underscores a perception which is somehow already in the air.",1
8,The effort to recapture art's ‘history’ is always entangled with the desire to remake its identity and meaning as part of contemporary struggles.,1
9,"This article comes the familiar experience of being drawn to a particular image, or set of images, without knowing why, and the attempt to account for this feeling.",1
10,"Looking intermittently at the so-called colonial art of Latin America in churches, museums, private collections and books, I became magnetised by the figures of angels.",1
11,They are extraordinarily resplendent.,1
12,They have a material splendour in their dress.,1
13,The spiritual (or is it the psychic?) intensity of their presence goes together with a marvellous air of freedom and delicacy.,1
14,"They have a tendency to expand, to fill the picture space.",1
15,"If the angel is already a hybrid (a human with wings), the Latin American angels seem to incorporate further incongruities into this composite of the human and the supernatural which hints at further, latent meanings.",1
16,"I knew that these paintings were produced for the Spanish in the decades after their conquest of Latin America, and represented the christianising of the old centres of Inca culture, in Peru and Bolivia especially.",1
17,I knew that in the main they were painted by Indian and mestizo artists at the command of the Europeans.,1
18,"It lodged in my mind to try and answer the question whether there was something special about the depiction of angels in post-conquest art, and if so, what it could be.",1
19,I didn't make a systematic study but I occasionally followed up clues if I came across references in books and catalogues.,1
20,I soon learned that the theme of angels was one of the most popular in the paintings produced by indigenous artists for the complex iconographic programmes of the churches and missions established by the Spanish after the conquest.,1
21,This word ‘popular’ is problematic and will be returned to later.,1
22,All colonial painting began in a process of copying.,1
23,"Indian artists were obliged, or forced, to abandon their own forms of representation and learn the European way.",1
24,"But after a period of sheer copying, some themes took off.",1
25,Some developed differently in the American context.,1
26,Why did angels especially flourish?,1
27,"As I investigated further, it seemed to become clear that if this question could be answered it could only be in a complex way.",1
28,"These paintings, in other words, could only be read as the site of a complex play of forces.",1
29,They were not simply transcriptions of the power of the conquerors and the coercive force with which they attempted to annihilate the existing culture and beliefs of the Indians and impose Christianity.,1
30,"Nor, obviously, were they a simple expression of Indian resistance to this assault.",1
31,In some way they were both these things .,1
32,The more I looked into it the more the paintings seemed to go beyond simple unitary ideas of authorship and meaning.,1
33,The Peruvian art historian Luis Enrique Tord has written:,1
34,"The Spanish conquest of the Inca empire had a profound impact on many aspects of Indian society, but the most serious blows suffered by the Andean peoples were administered by the Church.",1
35,The efforts of priests and missionaries to eradicate the Indians' ancestral beliefs produced profound emotional disturbances great changes in their conception of the world.,1
36,"To enforce conformity to the new orthodoxy, the Spaniards instituted ecclesiastical , or inspections intended to extirpate the idolatory that persisted long after the conquest.",1
37,"In the sphere of art the range of subjects and genres permitted by the church was extremely narrow, only in fact religious paintings and portraits.",1
38,At that time after the conquest there was effectively no ‘thought’(recorded discourse) outside the religious framework and institutions.,1
39,"The first university in Peru, , was founded by the Dominicans.",1
40,"Painting was from the beginning one of the most important instruments of conquest in the sphere of thinking, the mind.",1
41,In the earliest years of their missionary efforts Dr Tord writes:,1
42,the friars discovered that the Indians were deeply impressed by sacred images created with the newest artistic techniques brought from the Old World…,1
43,"Those images were first seen in the catechisms, Bibles, books of hours, and hymnals used to convert the Indians and direct their worship.",1
44,"‘The Archangel Raphael’, by a follower of Luis de Riano, Cuzco School c. 1640.",1
45,"Oil on canvas, 65″ x 42″.",1
46,"Convento de San Francisco, La Paz.",1
47,"The Jesuits brought over their leading painter in Europe in the late sixteenth century, the Italian Bernardo Bitti, to live and work in Cuzco.",1
48,A school of painting grew up in Cuzco which became the leading centre of the production of paintings south of Mexico and exported paintings and painters to many other parts of the continent including remote areas.,1
49,"Leopoldo Castedo, the Spanish-Chilean art historian writes:",1
50,"Of forty-seven painters documented in Cuzco during the period, thirty-five were Indians, seven criollos or mestizos, four Spaniards, and one Italian.",1
51,This list does not include the great number of Indians who remained anonymous….,1
52,"The similes usually used to describe the hybrid produced over the years by the Cuzco painters — the ‘melding’, or ‘blending’, or the ‘intricate amalgamation’ of European and indigenous traditions to produce an art of ‘Byzantine richness and splendour’— obviously belies the violence of events.",1
53,"These phrases do, however, have the ring of truth in an aesthetic sense — or rather there was an aesthetic process involved which had to some extent its own story.",1
54,"This was manifested not only in the precise, artistic and critical response by Indian peoples to European paintings, but also in connoisseurship within the colonising ranks.",1
55,"A blossoming of the arts followed the rebuilding of Cuzco after the catastrophic earthquake of 1650, partly the arrival of Bishop Manuel de Mollinedo y Angulo.",1
56,"His collection included two El Grecos, and other outstanding Spanish pictures, and he sponsored Indian painters like Diego Quispe Tito, sculptors, architects and jewellers.",1
57,"Sometimes the coercion and oppression felt directly in the paintings: , in images of Saint Isidore, a rather obscure Spanish saint vastly amplified in the New World as the patron of labourers, who is shown to carry a small bag of coca leaves as the Indian peasants and miners did, and do, to chew to combat hunger and fatigue.",1
58,Castedo points this out.,1
59,He also shows that images of were often changed to .,1
60,"Indian painters would in this case be painting an image showing the Church's and the State's warning to Indians who contemplated rebellion, as many did.",1
61,"And occasionally, as, , during or around the time of the rebellion led by Tupac Amaru II in 1780, an image would appear of explicit resistance to colonialism.",1
62,"In the somewhat unlikely context of the Pelican History of Art (the relevant volume is ), an anonymous painting is described which shows America:",1
63,nursing Spanish noble boys.,1
64,"Negroes and mestizos are pressing around her throne, while nude Indian children weep abandoned.",1
65,Two richly dressed Indian couples present their gifts in a beautiful park crowded with different animals.,1
66,The legend says: Where in the world has one seen what one sees here…,1
67,Her own sons lie groaning and she suckles strangers.,1
68,"The images of angels are much more ambiguous and capable of different interpretations (this could, , be said of the angel theme generally as it recurs in the history of art, and in various guises across different cultures).",1
69,It is not hard to find documentary evidence for the Church's deliberate use of the angel theme as an instrument of conversion.,1
70,"The Bolivian art historian Teresa Gisbert writes that the Councils of Lima, which were responsible for questions of orthodoxy in the Viceroyalty: ‘sought to attract Indians to the new faith by the use of images which would be especially appealing to them.'",1
71,Why were angels appealing to them?,1
72,"In the Pelican History, Martin Soria tentatively puts forward the theory that angels were popular because ‘they replaced similar messengers in pre-conquest beliefs’.",1
73,Teresa Gisbert produces evidence to show that Diego Quispe Tito's series of paintings of the zodiac for the Cathedral of Cuzco was commissioned to counteract the traditional indigenous worship of the stars and were intended to aid in Christianising the Indians of the Andes.,1
74,"And she suggests that the angels, especially the series of angels, could have a similar purpose, to ‘replace worship of celestial phenomena with the theologically acceptable cult of the angels’.",1
75,"So apparently they were ‘popular’, for different reasons, with both Christian and native American, with oppressor and oppressed.",1
76,"It is you could read in them simultaneously transcriptions of inducement, threat, coercion, protection, solace, yearning and resistance.",1
77,Does this explain their complex expressivity?,1
78,"For the same quality can be interpreted differently one's point of view, one's experience, and one's feelings.",1
79,"can mean Defence of the Faith, i.e. of Christianity, or it can mean the adoption and identification of a ‘guardian spirit’, who will watch over your life-journey, a universal, but at the same time very individual and personal desire, expressed in most religions and cultures.",1
80,"Looking at the angel's image you can dream, ask for what you want.",1
81,"The angel, with its brilliantly opulent but light clothing, its mobility, its freedom from hierarchical placing in the pictorial composition, and its bisexuality, is an intimate image of enablement.",1
82,"Among the images of angels is a genre apparently unique to South America, even to the Andes, the Angels with Guns.",1
83,"This was also a very popular subject (one church inventory for 1748, , lists 36 pictures of armed angels).",1
84,"Julia P. Herzberg, who calls these pictures ‘representations of winged  beings military, aristocratic and religious, gives this explanation of their ",1
85,Paintings of angels with guns appeared at a time when the religious orders were confronted with the stubborn persistence of pre-conquest religion amongst their Indian charges.,1
86,"Immense problems remained not merely in the campaign to destroy Indian idols, but in teaching and reinforcing the principles of the new faith.",1
87,"Sermons and catechisms were the primary means of conversion, but images of angels with guns were useful symbols of important teachings of the church.",1
88,The Spaniards conquered the Incas with both the Cross and the arquebus.,1
89,The key to understanding the religious function of these images is found in the gun motif.,1
90,"Firearms, unknown to the Indians at the time of the conquest, seemed a frightening manifestation of the supernatural, for they ‘fled fear when there was a blare of trumpets, the roar of arquebuses and artillery’.",1
91,The firearm in an angel's hands must have had a powerful impact on Indian converts.,1
92,"But since guns were also used defensively, the images functioned symbolically as reminders of the protection offered to those who embraced Christianity.",1
93,The image of the angel with a gun served a secular a religious function by emphasising the lesson that the Church and the Spanish colonial régime were united in their goal to christianize the Indians.,1
94,The military aspect of the crusade is subliminally suggested by the gentle figure who handles his firing weapon in varied positions which recall those of a fighting force.,1
95,"In speaking about the angels' clothing, Herzberg continues:",1
96,Far more important than the military aspects of the angel's costumes are the explicit references to the high social status of both Spanish colonial gentlemen and Inca royalty.,1
97,"Richly brocaded fabrics, ribbons, and lace characterize the opulent viceregal dress of the 17th century.",1
98,"The gentlemen-aristocratic nature of angels with guns is defined by their elegant dress, which relates them directly to the ruling viceregal aristocracy.",1
99,A key phrase here seems to me to be ‘gentle figure who handles his firing weapon’.,1
100,"Although the technical military details of loading and handling the gun , of the angel paintings, is very precise — taken in fact from a Flemish military manual of 1607 — the ‘common soldier’ of the image in the manual is not retained: he becomes the gorgeous aristocrat.",1
101,"The non-aggressive angel-like  pose, is extremely seductive, which makes the threat of force oblique, only implied, a beautiful face was being laid over the ugly face of violent coercion.",1
102,"Are these pictures simply transcriptions of power, in which the hard approach is mixed with the soft, and the Church is allied with the State (and in this case hinting , not just at the foreigner's domination of the native inhabitants but also at class conflict within colonial society, since the angel is a mélange of Spanish and Inca aristocracies)?",1
103,Perhaps.,1
104,"But again they seem to me more enigmatic, more multiple — images full of aesthetic tensions.",1
105,"Can one again make a conflation between domination and rebellion in the image, an expression of both the Church/State and the Indian wishes?",1
106,Leopoldo Castedo writes:,1
107,The prestige of the armed archangel was and is still very great.,1
108,"In mestizo architectural decoration of the 18th century, the archangel brandishing the flaming sword had a prominent place (particularly fine examples are in the Cathedral of Puno and San Lorenzo, in Potosi); and in the traditional (Bolivian devil play), a religious drama, the Archangel Michael defeats […]the Devil of the Seven Masks.",1
109,"In 1950, in a curious or consistent coincidence ($, Pope Pius XII declared the Archangel Michael patron of police — a decision that may well diminish the archangel's prestige in Latin America.",1
110,"‘Archangel with Gun’, by an anonymous painter of the Cuzco School, early 18th century.",1
111,"Oil on canvas, 63 1/4″ x 39 1/2″.",1
112,"Museo de Arte, Lima.",1

117,"dealing, as I have been doing, with one of the major subjects and themes of Cuzco painting, an inventory could be made of ways in which painters departed from European models, or from academic notions of excellence.",1
118,"There are peripheral insertions, like borders of flowers, or tropical birds which populate the background landscapes of many religious paintings.",1
119,"Or survivals at the level of colour: liking for flat and intense colours, local earth and vegetable dyes, which may go all the way back to the ancient textile traditions that of the Paracas culture in Peru.",1
120,"Also, intensification of the colours in the angels' wings as compared with Europe.",1
121,These questions were not merely ‘academic’.,1
122,"Disputes among Spanish and Indian painters themselves, in some ways antecedents of all subsequent debates around ‘indigenism’, go back to the early days in Cuzco.",1
123,In 1688 the Cuzco guild of painters split.,1
124,The immediate reason seems to have been that Indian painters working for some of the Spanish and criollo masters complained of mistreatment.,1
125,The Spanish admitted their guilt but no agreement could be reached and the two sides moved apart.,1
126,The Spanish guild tightened its European rules of style.,1
127,"The Indian painters lost contact with European developments and, Teresa Gisbert, ‘sought inspiration both in the old styles and in their own tastes and traditions’, a mixture of ornamental stylisation with observation of the reality around them.",1
128,"Their religious pictures, she writes, ‘belong to an archaic world […$ who viewed the religious realm as something ‘different’ from mundane reality.'",1
129,"The argument so far has been intended to put forward the possibility that an art work or image could be official and coercive, and unofficial and subversive, all at the same time.",1
130,The example I have given is the only one that exists.,1
131,"The  same process has been documented in other situations where a people have been conquered, colonised and their cultural beliefs assaulted.",1
132,Eduardo Mondlane found that African carvers in nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century Mozambique had made their own use of Christian themes imposed by priests and missionaries:,1
133,"When a [makonde]sculptor departs from the stereotype […$ this is nearly always because an element of doubt or defiance has been worked into it; a madonna is given a demon to hold the Christ Child; a priest is represented with the feet of a wild animal, a pietà becomes a study not of sorrow but of revenge, with the mother raising a spear over the body of her dead son.",1
134,"Magazine advertisement, featuring a painting by Botero.",1
135,Such images may startlingly demonstrate the general truth that the meaning of a work cannot simply be equated with its subject.,1
136,"But particularly intriguing is the phenomenon of syncretisation itself, as an process, and its relationship to meaning: the process whereby something new is created that cannot simply be reduced to either side of two antagonistic forces, or returned to a former ‘purity’.",1
137,A new ‘in-between’ is created.,1
138,This is especially true in the context of Latin America where this kind of duality and fusion has been a feature of culture from the time of the conquest right today — both on the popular and the intellectual level.,1
139,"‘Latin America is such a syncretic, eccentric, disjointed fusion of European, Amerindian and Afro-Caribbean culture,’ in the words of the Mexican artist Guillermo Gomez-Peña.",1
140,"Or, as the Chilean painter Juan Davila recently put it: ‘You take something of yourself, something of the conqueror’.",1
141,In both cases these are intellectuals talking about their own work by linking it with a process continually taking place at a popular level and in everyday life.,1
142,"Today, the image of the angel is still alive, and still in contention; it has been merely consigned to the museum.",1
143,It is still a part of contemporary power struggles.,1
144,On the one hand it has appeared as a focus for resistance.,1
145,"The militant angel appeared, , in wall paintings in Haiti during the shortlived popular uprising for food and democracy of 1986.",1
146,"The extraordinarily effective popular figure of the masked Superbarrio, who emerged spontaneously to lead the movement to demand the provision of proper housing in the aftermath of the disastrous Mexican earthquake of 1986, surely appeals to memories of the angel-enabler, references to Mexican popular masked wrestling heroes and perhaps to Superman.",1
147,"At the same time, the armed angel is continually reproduced as a figure of folklore, a naive stereotype of Latin America, typically exploited in the paintings of Fernando Botero, the highest selling Latin American artist in the world today.",1
148,"His shallow humour trades in, but misses the actual drama and sensibility of that hybrid fusion of the aristocratic and the popular which took place all those years ago in Cuzco.",1
149,"Symbolic angel lances a Tonton Macoute on a mural in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, 1989.",1

153,"‘Popular culture is not what is technically called folklore, but the popular language of permanent historical rebellion.’",1
154,"This sentence, by the Brazilian film-maker Glauber Rocha, written at the turn of the 1970s, clearly identifies a form of expression with a mass of oppressed people whose experience has been continuous over four centuries.",1
155,And Glauber also implies that the forms and images in which this experience is expressed are not fixed but open and changing.,1
156,"The sentence comes from an essay called , an eccentric spelling of (‘Aesthetic of the Dream') in which, building on the idea that ‘the dream is the only right which cannot be forbidden’, Glauber Rocha described how he had come to realise the revolutionary importance of the mystical in Latin American popular culture.",1
157,"It was the only way of contesting that ‘bourgeois reason’ which, for him, was as much a feature of left-wing political programmes as it was of traditional colonial domination.",1
158,"In his 1965 article, ‘Aesthetic of Hunger’, enormously influential on Third World cinema and art, Glauber felt he had given ‘the measure of my rational understanding of poverty’.",1
159,"By 1971 he was saying that, as artists:",1
160,"We must touch, by communion, the vital point of poverty which is its mysticism.",1
161,This mysticism is the only language which transcends the rational schema of oppression.,1
162,"The role of the angel as an intermediary between the human and the mystical world, and its elaborate beautifying as a vehicle of the dream, would seem to tie in closely with Glauber's identification of a continuing thread of psychological resistance in Latin American culture.",1

164,‘HER DRESS HANGS HERE': DE-FROCKING THE KAHLO CULT,1
165,Oriana Baddeley,1
166,The 1990s have witnessed a shift in the art establishment's attitudes towards art produced its traditional parameters.,1
167,The work of previously marginalised artists has become an area of rich speculation among art dealers priced the ‘modern masters’ market.,1
168,"Almost every year has witnessed the discovery of new artistic terrain — graffiti art, Soviet art, Australian art, the art of Latin America.",1
169,The major auction houses have moved with the times and have found new ways of selling works which in both form and content would have proved an unstable investment a decade ago.,1
170,The current status of the work of the Mexican painter Frida Kahlo is a dramatic example of this change.,1
171,"Once known primarily as the wife of Diego Rivera, her reputation Mexico now far supercedes his: since 1919, sale room estimates of her work have risen from $40,000 to over $1 million, and in 1990 a work by Kahlo broke all records at Sotheby's New York for a Latin American artist.",1
172,The enormous rise in the economic value of her work has developed in tandem with the increased critical and popular response to her particular blend of naive style and incisive content.,1
173,"While the first wave of popular interest arose with the 1982 Whitechapel exhibition instigated by Laura Mulvey and Peter Wollen, it was the publication of Hayden Herrera's biography of Kahlo in 1983 which has led to her current cult status.",1
174,"Since that date she has been the subject of TV documentaries, a feature film (‘Frida’ by Paul Leduc), a stage play, numerous publications and the inspiration for designer clothing.",1
175,"In May 1989 magazine ran a 16 page feature on Frida Kahlo as the ‘spirit of Mexico’(Fig. 1), while in (Feb. 1990) there was a 10 page interpretation of ‘the romance of Frida Kahlo's Mexico’(Fig. 2).",1
176,"Almost as a logical outcome of this media blitz, it emerged in the summer of 1990 that Madonna, already a devotee of Kahlo's work, was commissioning a screenplay based on Kahlo's life.",1
177,"Almost as a logical outcome of this media blitz, it emerged in the summer of 1990 that Madonna, already a devotee of Kahlo's work, was commissioning a screenplay based on Kahlo's life.",1
178,", May 1989, p. 18–19.",1
179,"As with most artists who have become mythical personalities in the popular imagination, such attention has focused primarily on the anecdotal and tragic details of Kahlo's admittedly fascinating life.",1
180,"The passionate obsession with her husband Diego Rivera, her flamboyant appearance, but most of all her physical and emotional pain have come to dominate responses to her work.",1
181,"While Kahlo's art helped her to deal with the vicissitudes of her life, for most audiences it is her life story which allows access to her art.",1
182,"In this one can draw obvious parallels to the appeal of Van Gogh, a traditionally popular artist recently made fashionable by the media attention generated during the centennial of his death.",1
183,The archetypal dropout/spiritualist became an appropriate icon for the sixties revival of 1990's long hot summer.,1
184,"Yet despite the iconic status of Van Gogh's ‘tragic’ life, it is the appearance of his work by which he is ultimately signified, his thick impasto brush-stroke, his vibrant yellows, the urgency of his creative drive.",1
185,"In the case of Kahlo the popular image is of the artist herself, the characteristic brows, the elaborate hair, the Mexican costume (Fig. 3).",1
186,"It is primarily her appearance, not the formal language of her art, that has graced the pages of and magazines.",1
187,The feature transposed the ‘Kahlo style’ to Kahlo lookalikes in contemporary clothing balanced around segments of Herrera's biography of  the artist.,1
188,"In the later piece only the style remained as the far more overtly sexual, Kahloesque models lounged and pouted in their ‘Mexican’ interiors.",1
189,"There is a poignant irony in the way clothing, which on one level served to hide Kahlo's broken body, falls or is lifted by the model to reveal a luxuriantly perfect physique (Fig. 4).",1
190,The visual references in the two magazines are as much from photos of the artist her work.,1
191,"In both features she is also seen to embody a wider set of assumptions about Mexico itself; exotic, passionate, yet constantly struggling against pain and deceit.",1
192,"While and subsequently (Fig. 5), stressed different facets of Kahlo's public persona, they all shared the emphasis on ‘her’, as an encapsulisation of stereotypical images of Mexico, her work.",1
193,"It is her body as the canvas, her appearance as art.",1

198,", May 1989, p. 28.",1
199,", the line between art and life is a particularly hard one to draw in Kahlo's case.",1
200,The majority of her work is self portraiture; her aesthetic concerns grew from her fascination with the falsity of appearance.,1
201,"Dressing up, role playing and masquerade form the conceptual basis of Kahlo's work.",1
202,"In (1944)(Fig. 6), she paints herself wearing Rivera's suit, challenging traditional expectations of femininity and attempting to appropriate his authority (while simultaneously) threatening castration).",1
203,"More disturbingly, in (1945)(Fig. 7), she throws doubt on too straightforward a reading of her self-portraits as revealing of her inner emotions.",1
204,Where does the mask fall: Does not the ritual repetition of those familiar features ‘mask’ far more than it uncovers?,1
205,"There is, however, an inevitable logic to the appropriation of her meticulously constructed image, a process which the artist was mocking as early as 1933: ‘…some of the gringa women are imitating me and trying to dress ‘Mexicana’, but the poor souls only look like cabbages and to tell you the naked truth they look absolutely impossible.'",1
206,"The ‘impossibility’ stemmed from the failure of such followers to recognise the symbolic importance of Kahlo's choice of clothing, a failure also intrinsic to her recent magazine appearances.",1
207,"The particularities of post-revolutionary Mexico are frequently subsumed by the decorativeness of the ethnic, by the generalised attractiveness of the radical avant-garde.",1
208,"For Kahlo, however, choosing to don the costume of the Tehuana, example in (1946)(Fig. 8), was to embody a powerful icon of cultural identity.",1
209,"Mexican Indian dress is extraordinarily diverse and geographically specific, varying from region to  region.",1
210,The Tehuana dress is the most decorative variant or the closest to pre-Hispanic forms of clothing.,1
211,It is the mythology surrounding the women wearers of the costume which directed Kahlo's choice.,1
212,"The ostensibly matriarchal society of Tehuantepec led to the adoption of the Tehuana, in post-revolutionary Mexico, as the image of the strong Indian woman; the undefeated counterpart to the despised ‘Chingada’, who, conversely is the female embodiment of Mexico's hybrid post-conquest culture.",1
213,"In a culture where sexual metaphors are frequently used to convey racial and political conflict, the Tehuana represents that aspect of Mexico's indigenous tradition unbowed by centuries of colonial and male rule.",1
214,"Kahlo's adoption of Tehuana dress, while being an attractive disguise of what she saw as a less than perfect body, asserted both a feminist and an anti-colonialist position.",1

219,"In Kahlo's work there is a powerful mix of these discourses, yet her role as an archetypal woman painter has come to dominate responses to her work.",1
220,It is through her emergence as a cult painter of the feminist movement of the 1970s that her current reputation has evolved.,1
221,Her work almost perfectly illustrates debates the nature of traditional exclusions of a woman's art.,1
222,"The fascination with functions of the body, the analogies between artistic  and physical creative processes, self-portraiture used to reveal the female body as the site of patriarchal aesthetic discourse; all of these mirror the concerns of many women painters of the 1980s.",1

234,"In their formal language, Kahlo's works are exemplary of certain feminist arguments; the adoption of the decorative, the intimate and non-fine art mediums reveals the restrictive nature of traditional definitions of ‘high art’.",1
235,"This ‘appropriateness’ of Kahlo's aesthetic to contemporary debate has tended to remove her work from its historical context, to stress the collective and the cross-cultural.",1

237,"More problematic is the way in which such a dislocation has led to the acceptance of her ‘Mexicanness’ as mere decoration of the essentially feminist themes of her work, thereby defusing a substantial part of the art described by Breton as a ‘ribbon round a bomb’.",1
238,"It is the ribbon that runs through the pages of , the glossy surface of the images in direct opposition to a work Kahlo's (1939)(Fig. 9).",1
239,"In this painting, a memorial to a woman's tragic death is transformed into an indictment of the culture which destroyed her.",1
240,Hale's suicide became a poignant metaphor for the oppressive nature of the social values of New York and North America .,1
241,"The story behind Hale's death was one with which Kahlo obviously identified, and within which dress formed an important symbolic function.",1
242,"Before jumping from the window of her apartment, Hale had dressed meticulously in her most flattering dress, the corsage of yellow roses a gift from a male admirer.",1
243,"In Kahlo's painting, the figure falls from the fantasy world she has inhabited to the harsh bloodspattered reality of the street, literally coming down to earth.",1
244,"Hale's eyes stare knowingly at the viewer, a human sacrifice to an alienated and consumerist culture.",1
245,The horizontality of her fallen body is juxtaposed to the vertical thrust of the apartment building.,1
246,She leaps from an architectural monument to a phallocentric world.,1
247,"Although destroyed, she has also escaped.",1
248,"The painting, dedicated to Hale's mother, was commissioned by a mutual friend of Kahlo and Dorothy Hale, the managing editor of , Clare Boothe Luce.",1
249,The painting was agreed to by Luce to recompense for what she saw as her misjudgment of her dead friend.,1
250,"Having lent Hale money to pay her rent she had been angered to discover her spending enormous sums on an haute-couture dress, and refused to turn what, in retrospect, became Hale's farewell party.",1
251,Later it was revealed that the money had come from a different source.,1
252,"A male friend had tried to dissuade Hale from seeking a much needed job and had given her a thousand dollars to buy ‘the most beautiful dress in New York’, telling her that what she needed was to find a rich husband.",1
253,"On one level this work deals with a generalised ‘woman's experience’, yet the metaphorical power of Dorothy Hale's dress derives from Kahlo's use of clothing in her own self-portraits.",1
254,Dress not only covers and decorates the body but instils in the wearer its own characteristic strengths and weaknesses.,1
255,Hale's black velvet dress is cursed because it represents the values of the ‘Gringolandia’ so hated by Kahlo.,1
256,"In those paintings where Kahlo wears European dress she is passive, weak and unable to control her own destiny, but in the Tehuana costume she is strong, powerful, hopeful.",1
257,"Unclothed, her body becomes yet more vulnerable, but as Jean Franco states:",1
258,"The unclothed body is not a ‘self but a socialised body, a body that is opened by instruments, technologized, wounded, its organs displayed to the outside world.",1
259,"The ‘inner’ Frida is controlled by modern society far more than the clothed Frida, who often marks her deviation from the norm by defiantly returning the gaze of the viewer.",1
260,"Kahlo's naked body becomes not just the tortured self of her personal biography but a visual counterpart to the injured and defiled manifestations of Mexico's colonised past: La Llorona ‘the weeping woman’ of popular myth and La Chingada, the raped and abused mother described in Paz's .",1
261,"Descended from an Aztec mother goddess, Llorona is a long-suffering mother figure, symbolic in a wider sense of the trauma of the  Spanish invasion.",1
262,"Driven mad with grief by the loss of her child, she is thought to wander the streets weeping and crying out a ghostly memory of the pre-Conquest past.",1

273,On one level is a coda to (1932)(Fig. 11) of the previous year.,1
274,"This small painting on metal, in the style of a Catholic votive image, shows the artist poised between the technological inhumanity of a capitalist North America and the archaic fertility of Mexico.",1
275,Interwoven with these images are subtler references to the metaphorical borderlines which separate Latin American culture from that of Europe and North America.,1

307,Valerie Fraser,1
308,It is a truism to say that that which cannot be readily classified will tend to be overlooked.,1
309,"In Art History the rehabilitation of artists and bodies of work which have been overlooked has been going on since Vasari made such a good job of classifying Florentine art that all other art in Italy and beyond has had to be defined, until this century, and at some level even now, Vasari's classifications, or the model of stylistic evolution which he outlined.",1
310,"Non-Italian artists, non-Italian preoccupations, women artists, artists working in media Vasari's chosen painting, sculpture and architecture, non-Western art : critics have been busy reviewing such areas and, in so doing, producing new categories and classifications.",1
311,"Latin American art has been undergoing such a review both from within Latin America itself and from elsewhere, with several exhibitions and books on the subject in the last few years in Europe and the US.",1
312,That there should be an issue of the devoted to Latin American art is itself testimony to the success of such efforts.,1
313,But new categories can in turn prove to be exclusive.,1
314,Within the field of Latin American art as a whole there are still many individual artists who have not received the attention they deserve because their work does not seem to fit into any larger pattern.,1
315,"In the case of the work of the Mexican Alberto Gironella, the reason would seem to be precisely his insistent concentration on art of a very different category — that of Spain during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, particularly court portraiture.",1
316,"Among the more comprehensive books on twentieth-century Mexican art in recent years, Shifra Goldman only mentions him in passing, Luis Cardoza y Aragón says little more than that Gironella ‘escapes him’, and Ida Rodriguez Prampolini dismisses him from her discussion of Mexican surrealism as an ‘international’ artist, more closely related to Spain than to Mexico.",1
317,"When he has inspired sympathetic coverage, the results tend to be not so much an exposition of Gironella's achievements but belong to that particular branch of literature which uses works of art as a starting point for literary excursus.",1
318,"Octavio Paz's elegant essay is the prime example, where despite some insightful remarks he uses Gironella's work to make general observations about the creative role of the critic, , or for digressive flourishes on Spanish culture.",1
319,"When they met in Paris in 1963, Breton hailed him as a surrealist, but in a recent interview Gironella disclaimed so tidy a classification, saying he is as much a baroque artist as a surrealist.",1
320,"In fact, although there are both surreal and baroque elements in his work, Gironella prefers to call it mestizo’, a term which has often had negative, racist overtones but which has been acclaimed in this century, especially in Mexico, as a positive value, indeed distinguishing feature of Mexican culture: the rich and fruitful mixture of the European with the indigenous American.",1
321,"This rather simple notion, that there is one single Mexican culture, problematic principally because it tends to valorize the European over the indigenous and to ignore the diversity, and richness of the latter, but also, conversely, because it excludes or denigrates the more purely European aspects of the culture.",1
322,"Nevertheless it seems to me that Gironella is right, or that he is right he is using ‘mestizo’ to claim for his work a Mexican, not a European identity.",1
323,"He is probably also right when he says that he is only seen as a artist because his interest lies in Spanish art, in French art ‘like everyone else': in other words, within the accepted categories there is no room for a Mexican who is interested in Spanish art.'",1
324,My purpose in what follows is to try to place him within a Mexican context.,1
325,"Gironella's subject matter is the acclaimed artistic masterpieces of the Spanish past which he reworks in various ways, most dramatically into ironic altars assembled from a variety of painted, sculpted and ready-made elements (Fig. 1).",1
326,"Favoured subjects are court portraiture, and allegorical images of death, decay and the transience of life, usually handled with the blackest of black humour.",1
327,"Favoured artists are Goya and his predecessors in the Golden Age —— El Greco, Pereda, Valdés Leal and above all Velázquez.",1
328,"It is worth emphasising that the period spanned by the lives of El Greco and Velázquez saw in Latin America the consolidation of colonial government and of the Christian church, the establishment of the Spanish language and of European culture, the introduction of new methods of exploitation of people and resources.",1
329,"Goya's life, on the other hand, coincides with the decline and ultimate collapse of the Empire; Spanish rule in America had been overthrown by the time of his death in 1828.",1
330,"In other words, these artists lived during American's formative years.",1
331,"the work of the artists who interpreted their historical reality canvas, but the importance in Latin America of the art itself should not be underestimated, particularly the iconography of the monarchy.",1
332,"Velázquez's name, , would have been familiar to very few Mexicans in the seventeenth century, but as the only artist authorised to execute likenesses of the King his official portraits of Philip IV and the innumerable engravings after them would have been well known.",1
333,"A painting by his contemporary, Juan Bautista Maino,, of 1635, represents the recapture of the harbour of Bahia in Brazil (then under Spanish control) from the Dutch in 1625.",1
334,"(Fig. 2) While an injured man is tended in the foreground, the Dutch forces to the right kneel in homage before an allegorical tapestried portrait of Philip IV.",1
335,"This is a highly unusual painting in a number of ways, not least because no such royal portrait could ever have existed, including as it does, and on almost equal status with the king, the figure of his ambitious minister the Count-Duke of Olivares.",1
336,"Nevertheless, on special occasions the Spanish authorities in America would certainly have erected large representations of the king in this manner, as objects of semi-religious devotion.",1
337,On the death of a member of the royal family elaborate catafalques were constructed in cathedrals throughout the Empire and the deceased mourned in effigy.,1
338,Paintings and prints were distributed to colonial officials for display in much the same way as British embassies are provided with an official photographic portrait of the Queen.,1
339,"In other words, the focus of Gironella's attention is neither historically nor iconographically arbitrary, although in some ways his reworkings of the paintings of others could be seen to be simply an extension of a fairly conventional activity.",1
340,"Within the Western tradition of art we tend to take it for granted that much can be learned from the study of the art of the past and, traditionally, copying from the works of the Great Masters was one of a young student's most important tasks.",1
341,"This activity, this dependence on the art of the past, is not, in itself, ideologically highly-charged.",1
342,"Reynolds may have admired and borrowed from Michelangelo, and while this could be said to represent, perhaps, a long-standing tradition of cultural domination — or the domination in England of the Italianate tastes of the English upper classes — it would be a mistake to make too much of this.",1
343,In the case of Latin America it is more complex.,1
344,"Historically the relationship between Latin America and Europe is not only one of cultural domination of the former by the latter, but of political and economic domination.",1
345,"While the obvious colonial ties have been broken, the power still lies elsewhere.",1
346,"The sources of domination have in some ways simply broadened to include the US, japan, and international capitalism.",1
347,"Within the art world the problem remains that the production of art in Latin America, from a student's training to the art market, is rooted firmly in the European tradition, while to compound the difficulties, few Latin American museums can boast any examples of European, North American or even non-national art .",1
348,"Everything conspires to exacerbate the situation: conventional art education teaches an art-historical line of descent through the successive achievements of the Great Masters, but such works are unavailable in Latin America except in the form of often poor-quality reproductions.",1
349,In this sense things have not changed much since the seventeenth century.,1
350,Gironella always seems acutely aware of these issues.,1
351,"For him the reworking of familiar images is not simply a matter of drawing attention to the way in which mass-reproduction numbs the optic nerves, by shocking the spectator with a moustached Mona Lisa, but rather, using a peculiar blend of both iconoclasm a sort of wry homage, of investigating the power of certain images, particularly those which have national resonance.",1
352,"In this sense his Habsburg and Bourbon portraits are not dissimilar to Jasper Johns' American flag series, except that the flag, whatever individuals may think of it, is unquestionably American, the lineage is clear.",1
353,"The connecting threads between the Spanish  monarchy and colonial Mexico, between Spanish artists and Mexican, between past and present, are tangled or broken.",1
354,"Within Spanish art itself, on the other hand, the line is almost too simple: Goya was intensely aware of Velázquez, Picasso of both, Gironella the problem is not just that Picasso could be seen to have inserted himself into the next place in the sequence but that as a Mexican an unequivocal position in any such art-historical lineage is utterly unattainable.",1

358,Gironella was born in Mexico City in 1929.,1
359,His rather was Catalan; he had come to Mexico as a young man and worked in his brother-in-law's grocery shop.,1
360,"He later set up his own business importing groceries from Europe, particularly from Spain.",1
361,"His mother was Yucatecan, a mestiza from Mérida, but she was ‘catalanised’, as Gironella put it, by his father and grandmother; in other words a jointly Eurocentric upbringing, but, perhaps significantly, without personal contact with Europe until his first visit to Paris in 1960.",1
362,"He absorbed European culture through nineteenth-century French novels, and through the literature of sixteenth and seventeenth-century Spain, the Spanish cultural Golden Age.",1
363,"His major literary enterprise, as a student at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma in 1951, was the invention of a bad Golden Age poet whom he named Tiburcio Esquirla.",1
364,His later artistic inventions display the same fascination with the possibilities of getting inside the skin of another era.,1
365,"Through his efforts in this direction he effectively mocks much that is dear to scholars, historians, literary critics and art historians, especially the concept of a clear chronological sequence: his answer to the problem of how a Mexican can ‘belong’ to the dynasty of European art is, , to invade it retrospectively.",1
366,The decisive move from literature to painting came in 1952.,1
367,"Gironella seems to have been very confident about the change, as in the same year he was instrumental, together with Vlady and Héctor Xavier, in establishing a new art gallery in Mexico City, the Galeria Prisse.",1
368,"This quickly emerged as one of the most avant-garde of the new Mexican galleries, and the locus of a group of young artists, including José Luis Cuevas, who ‘with no fixed programme and no common plastic language,[…]were united only by the desire for change’.",1
369,"Their discontent at this time was principally with the social realism of the muralist school but, even at this early date, there was unease with the propaganda emanating from the US that Abstract Expressionism was  the only possible alternative.",1
370,"Gironella's solution was entirely individual: to focus on the art of the European past, looming large as it did in Latin American consciousness regardless of how often it had been declared dead and buried by Europeans.",1

374,"His artistic career began with a series of paintings based on the thirteenth-century sculpture of the elegant countess of Uta on the façade of Naumburg cathedral, a photograph of which had been lent to him by the young artist Vlady, but in the late fifties he turned his attention to Spanish art.",1
375,"His early choice of subject set the tone for his later work —— Goya's Queen Maria Luisa, and Velázquez's portrait of the dwarf Francisco Lezcano (Fig. 3)— in other words, great Spanish artists' handling of their arrogant, ugly, bizarre or idiotic sitters.",1
376,"He subjected both to repeated analysis, ending up with a version of Maria Luisa in which she is transformed into a sharp-beaked, staring owl, and of Francisco Lezcano in which he has metamorphosed into a dog.",1
377,"In both, Gironella is exploring the characters of the sitters as suggested in their portraits the formal, painterly qualities.",1
378,"Is Velázquez's Francisco Lezcano simple-minded, or is his expression one of aloofness and distance?",1
379,"Gironella has said he was drawn to this painting because Lezcano is holding some playing cards, so his disconcertingly direct gaze is inviting us in to test our wits and/or our luck against him.",1
380,"Queen Maria Luisa, wife of Charles IV, an unlovely, clever, deceitful and immensely powerful woman, is metamorphosed into a barn-owl, a , a word which in Spanish also means an ugly hag or a procuress.",1
381,Gironella's first direct encounter with Velázquez was at an exhibition of his work at the Metropolitan Museum in New York in 1959.,1
382,"Amongst the works on view was the one to which he has returned most often — the portrait of Queen Mariana of Austria, second wife of Philip IV, painted in 1652 (Fig. 4).",1
383,This painting has become a veritable obsession and he has returned to it repeatedly over the past thirty years.,1
384,"It is a full-length portrait showing the young queen very formally dressed, in a stiff conventional pose, looking out at the spectator.",1
385,"She wears a gigantic wig decorated with feathers and red bows, the shape of which echoes that of the wide skirt.",1
386,"One arm rests on the farthingale of the skirt, the hand very delicately holding a large white scarf; the other hand rests on a chair back.",1
387,"In the earliest versions, which date from 1959 — 60, Gironella turns her into a sort of rag doll; perhaps never more than a well-dressed shell, she is now simply a collage of fragments of coarse, torn cloth that appear to be pasted  down with thick smears of paint (Fig. 5).",1
388,"These early half-length versions, like close-up details of the original, also investigate compositional qualities, the slight angle of the torso to the picture plane and the relationship of head and wig to shoulders, emphasising features which are to become increasingly fetishised in subsequent renderings — the massive wig, .",1
389,"And in the second version he introduces a three-dimensional hand not, as in the Velázquez with the fingers straight and limp, but drawn up into an uneasy gesture, that claws at her skirt rests against it.",1
390,"The hand and the wig are to become identifying features, often used in isolation or elements from other pictures.",1

399,"In this full-length version Gironella places her square to the picture plane, a crucial adjustment which changes the tone from that of the formality of the original into one of helplessness.",1
400,"Moving from her external trappings to her internal structure, he represents her as a sort of wooden skeleton.",1
401,"At her breast, a gold rosette, she wears a brass bell and a series of wheels and cogs, apparently parts of an old-fashioned, manually operated lift.",1
402,She is like a mechanical musical doll that will perform a ponderous dance when someone turns the dial.,1
403,She is also black.,1

417,"In one version, the space beneath the seat contains a small, stuffed cayman and, as this is the equivalent of the space beneath her skirts, there are obvious psycho-sexual overtones.",1
418,"In another there is in fact no seat as such, rather like a monk's misericord, a chair that is not a chair (Fig. 7).",1
419,Again her heart is represented by the mechanism from an old lift: she goes up and down as others will her.,1
420,The origins of Gironella's peculiar assemblages lie in his childhood.,1
421,"His earliest memories are of stacks of colourful imported tins, boxes, bottles and packets of the family grocery business, and of the paraphernalia of popular Catholicism, which would have included reliquaries and tabernacles, retables combining paintings and sculpture, altars decorated with damask cloth, candles, flowers and of an often intensely personal nature.",1
422,He recalls building himself private altars of chocolate wrappers and tin cans.,1
423,"The packaging of imported products has continued to fascinate him, for intrinsic qualities —— the names, the colours and the designs — but also the way products from far away have been integrated into the domestic Mexican environment.",1
424,"Such products are known by the general term , ‘from across the ocean’, and to emphasise that Mariana herself is also an , she is often accompanied in Gironella's tableaux by tins of sardines.",1
425,"There are connections here too with Spanish Golden Age painting which, as Gironella himself has observed, often looks very .",1
426,The picaresque literature of the period is also very preoccupied with food and drink.,1
427,"But it is not just the strong smells of food, but the metaphorical smells of corruption and moral and social decay which are suggested by the inclusion of such items in his work.",1
428,"And where the tins of fish are juxtaposed with fragments of Mariana's body the evocation is also of death and putrefaction, perhaps also of coarse jokes about the distinctive ‘fishy’ smell of vaginal secretions.",1
429,Gironella's choice of Veláquez's Mariana as the basis for so many of his works is worth considering in more detail.,1
430,"First, to develop the idea of the punning associations already referred to the term , there is the pleasing assonance between the name of this earthly Queen Mariana, and that of Maria, Queen of Heaven.",1
431,"The Virgin has always been more popular than Christ in the New World; indeed in the sixteenth century certain churchmen had argued that while the East was the domain of Christ, the newly discovered West was that of his mother.",1
432,"Once in America, however, Maria soon fragments into numerous different Marias, each with her own distinctive attributes.",1
433,"In Mexico, during the Wars of Independence the Virgin of Guadalupe protected the nationalist forces while the Spaniards placed their trust in the Virgen de los Remedios.",1
434,"Gironella's many versions of Velázquez's Mariana similarly fragment her into different roles — queen, woman, icon, cadaver, carnival figure, victim, aggressor.",1
435,"There is a third sister in this euphonious family: Marina, the baptised name of Malinche, mistress of Cortèz, through whose good offices and linguistic skills Mexico was conquered both for the Virgin Maria, and for Marina's royal ancestors.",1
436,"Marina is the original and ultimate traitor to her people, but as mother of the first mestizo she is also the mother of modern Mexico.",1
437,Mariana herself is remembered more as a name on a family tree than as a person.,1
438,"Wife of Philip IV, she was also his niece; she had been betrothed to his son Baltasar Carlos but on his death at seventeen the King (her uncle) married her himself, and the only surviving son of this union was the cretinous Charles II, last of the Habsburg line.",1
439,"She is also remembered because she was painted by Velázquez, although this is not unrelated to the family tree.",1
440,"Velázquez shaped the public image of this family for his own and for all subsequent generations, investing them with an extraordinary pictorial power and stability.",1
441,"His portraits must in turn be considered an important constituent in their power, as compensation for their more corporeal weaknesses.",1
442,"With hindsight it perhaps seems strange that one of the indisputably greatest figures in the whole of Western art devoted the better part of his life to sell-advancement, and to painting the King, his family, and their attendant dogs, dwarves and sycophants Certainly the irony of this, together with the fact that this inbred family of often considerable mental physical fragility should have controlled the destiny of so vast an empire, is not lost on Gironella.",1

446,"We can read into such a view of the Habsburgs (Fig. 8): Philip IV and Mariana are merely reflections, living in a world of grotesquerie and make-believe; a tiny princess dressed as an adult with a skirt so stiff it makes her look she is on wheels, surrounded by curtseying maids, a dwarf, a midget, a huge dog with the ability to sleep through anything, and a great artist, aloof and all-powerful.",1
447,"Such a view is anachronistic, but this is exactly the attraction of Gironella's reworkings — he can present us with shifting visions of the art of the past, from within and from without, exploiting contrary responses, period eye innocent eye.",1

474,"The word in Spanish, as in English, evokes different ideas:colonial, el yugo matrimonial and , the colonial yoke, and the yokes of marriage and of the church, and all of these are implied here.",1
475,"Mariana is yoked in an arranged marriage to her uncle, Philip IV; she, as representative of the Spanish crown, is also a representative of the colonial and religious yokes which bound Mexico to Spain.",1
476,"The motif of the yoke was originally the emblem of Isabella of Castile, Mariana's distant predecessor, who had been responsible for sending Columbus on his first transatlantic voyage in 1492; in other words she had been responsible for initiating the whole colonial process (Fig. 12).",1
477,In the present century the combined emblems of Isabella's yoke (for Ysabella) and her husband Ferdinand's arrows () were expropriated by the Falangists in an attempt to claim some historical legitimacy.,1
478,"In other words, verbally and visually the emblem of the yoke has strong resonances in Spain and Mexico.",1
479,"But it is important that here the yokes are inverted: Mariana and the ties with Spain she represents have been transformed, translated into Mexican, into the  complexities of the mestizo Mexican present.",1
480,"She is an essential but individually helpless cog in the colonial machine; she is pinned out like a pre-columbian sacrificial victim, bruised and blood-stained; she is a religious icon, like a popular image of the Virgin Maria; she is a mannikin from some popular religious festival.",1

488,It is worth stressing the differences between Gironella's treatment of the art of the Spanish past and that of Picasso.,1
489,"Picasso's extensive series of variations on was produced in 1957, but Gironella knew of them when he himself began to work on versions of Velázquez (which is highly unlikely, as Picasso's paintings were not exhibited until 1959); their interest in the art of the past at that point in their careers was for both, perhaps, a rejection of abstraction; and both can in some way be defined as exiled from their Spanish roots, as outsiders looking in —— yet the results are widely divergent.",1
490,"Picasso's paintings are principally explorations of, or developments of matters internal to the light, the perspective, the angle of Mariana's head, the bobbing handmaids, echoed, , in the paintings of pigeons bobbing on his window sill, .",1
491,"In one version, , the odd position of Nicolas Pertusato's hands is rationalised by the addition of a piano.",1
492,Gironella is far removed from such light humour.,1

494,"Gironella is also interested in the formal qualities of these works, but it is the subject matter, the content, which really holds his imagination.",1
495,"Drawn to the fact-is-stranger-than-fiction aspects of Spanish history, Gironella found in Veláquez's portraits a perfect starting point for a detailed investigation of the contradictions which go to make up modern Mexico.",1
496,"His preoccupations are unusual (if not unique, as he claims) but they are unquestionably engendered by the search for a cultural identity which lies behind so much of Latin America's greatest artistic and literary creations.",1
497,"Ambivalence towards European culture, doubts about the possibilities of finding an authentic voice, a restless search for confidence and self-esteem, these are among the many bitter fruits of colonial rule in Latin America.",1
498,"In 1921, Siqueiros had urged artists to ‘avoid those lamentable archaeological reconstructions’(‘Indianism’, ‘Primitivism’, ‘Americanism') but he had also warned against the use of ‘archaic motifs’ from the old masters of European art ‘which for us would be exotic’; instead his advice was to study the arts of both, learning from the ‘constructive base’, the ‘great sincerity’, of the latter, and the ‘synthetic energy’of the former, to combine the ‘lost values’of the past with new values to produce an art appropriate to modern America.",1

505,"What is it that makes this substantial book produce, mixed-in with its rewards and knowledge, a depressing effect?",1
506,Does it matter?,1
507,"Callinicos' own apology about publishing yet another study of an over-worked subject notwithstanding, it remains an important contemporary debate.",1
508,It isn't that; the more so since Callinicos' contribution contains a significantly original dimension.,1
509,Despite its fashionable subject the book is in no sense routine.,1
510,"Uncritical testimonials to the postmodern's attractions are ten a penny, and conservative denunciations thereof not much scarcer.",1
511,"This study has the distinction of being both critical and radical, essentially turning the tables on advocates of the postmodern and reading their rhetoric as symptomatic of a conservative milieu's interests in a period of overall stagnation.",1
512,"It is ‘’ unlikely that Callinicos' criticism will cut much ice with those whose substantial career investments lie in one or another of the postmodern's corners: movementist politics, the radical academy, post this-ism and that-ism, a variety of well-upholstered ‘dissenting’niches from both the dominant culture and traditional opposition to it.",1
513,Too much is at stake for a book dedicated to proving the continuing value of classical Marxism to dislodge them.,1
514,"Maybe this is one reason for depression, then: that the book's well-wrought arguments will not exercise those whose ideology it dissects.",1
515,This indeed has already happened.,1
516,"Callinicos' Marxism has been repelled from the ramparts of pluralism for being…well, Marxist.",1
517,"It leads to the Gulag, you know, and is patriarchal (translation: Marx had a beard).",1
518,"Callinicos' book is difficult, and given the probability that despite the seriousness of its argument it is unlikely to be widely debated, I will firstly offer an interpretation of what I think its main themes are, and what they are not.",1
519,"In the first place, as the title makes plain, if offers a searching criticism of the claim that we are living in a postmodern epoch, and the consequence of that claim, that the culture and politics appropriate to such an epoch are structurally different from those of the preceding — and now past — Modern one.",1
520,"Callinicos' criticism of the ‘postmodern’ hypothesis contains a range of emphases, the three principal ones of which are: First: advocates of the postmodern in art (which attains uncommon prominence the ‘postmodern’is powerfully underwritten by a claimed distinction from Modernism), tend to misread the modern and arrogate its defining characteristics to their own period.",1
521,"The main ones of these are: the ordering concept of ‘doubling’—— double coding, the laying of one text over or against another; the relationship to historical codes of representation; and the relationship to popular codes of representation.",1
522,"Callinicos is able to set the claims of such postmodern advocates as Charles Jencks and Linda Hutcheon against an analysis of Modernism (predicated largely on that of Eugene Lunn) to demonstrate that the latter is more complex its characteristic conceptions of the subject, expression, reflexion etc, than the former are wont to have it.",1
523,"This is so to the extent that the claim for a structurally distinct postmodernist mode of signification breaks down in the face of a variety of historical avant-garde practices ranging across Europe from London to Vienna and Moscow in the hands of Eliot, Joyce, the Cubists, Surrealists and others (including, somewhat surprisingly, Kokoschka).",1
524,"A further set of more qualified — or less wholesale — more ambiguous claims are then encountered, by authors Lyotard, Jameson and Lash.",1
525,These include: the postmodern as a tendency within the modern; a notion of the ‘sublime’ and postmodernism's related freedom from dependence on the concept of totality; a distinction between the postmodern conceived the externalised and impersonal a view of the modern as characterised by the internal and ‘impressionist’; and a claim that it is the characteristic of the postmodern to signify figurally discursively (?).,1
526,"Callinicos' conclusion to these arguments is that despite their efforts, built around a claimed contrast of the postmodern either with or within Modernism, these authors have produced only ‘mutually and often internally inconsistent accounts’ of the ‘postmodern’, manifesting an ‘inability to come up with a plausible and coherent account of its distinguishing characteristics’(p. 28).",1
527,"It is in fact Callinicos' later claim that, occupying a qualitatively distinct position, ‘late capitalist culture represents a continuation of trends operative throughout this century’(p. 53).",1
528,"The second main emphasis of Callinicos' critique is aimed at the philosophy most frequently regarded as underpinning claims for the distinction of a postmodern culture, viz. poststructuralism.",1
529,"Drawing on  his own previous work, that of Dews and Habermas, the main thrust is initially to connect both ‘wings’ of poststructuralism — the ‘textualist’strand associated with Derrida, and the ‘contextualist/historical strand identified principally with Foucault — to the Nietzschean philosophical tradition; and then to isolate the most common problems attributed to that tradition to which,, post-structuralism succumbs.",1
530,"These concern: the subject; the issue of how critical resistance to dominant codes ever develops in the absence of an adequate conception of the subject; and, perhaps most fundamentally, the traditional problem facing any philosophy seeking to reduce knowledge to interests , of using rational argument to prove the limits on rationality.",1
531,"This is the densest, yet at the same time one of the most persuasive sections of the book, wherein a variety of arguments drawn from the analytic tradition are deployed against Nietzsche's lineage: Quine and Davidson on a theory of meaning both holistic and realist — demonstrating that there are more ways atomism and the myths of the given than Saussure's; and an anti-relativist notion of truth as a ‘regulative ideal’ derived from Tarski, Popper and Lakatos.",1
532,"There is no space here, central though it is to Callinicos' argument as a whole, to do note how this perspective is then deployed not only to counter poststructuralism but also significantly to modify the position of its main critic, Habermas.",1
533,"If Foucault and Derrida are taken to task for their Nietzschean lineage, Habermas' main weakness is deemed to lie in his Kantianism, manifest in a formalist ‘metaethics’, and his conception of ‘communicative rationality’ grounded in the consensual account of meaning offered by speech-act theory — and as such likewise vulnerable to Davidson, as well Wittgenstein.",1
534,"In essence then, at this philosophical level, Callinicos is marrying historical materialism and analytical philosophy, Marx and Wittgenstein, to defeat a range of new and old Idealisms: principally that tradition, dismissive of Enlightenment rationalism, descending from Nietzsche via Heidegger to a bathetic end in Lyotard and Baudrillard.",1
535,"Compelling as it is, however, this strategy does not form the conclusion of Callinicos' case.",1
536,The third main emphasis in his critique of the concept of the postmodern is to attempt to explain the hold exercised by a demonstrably deficient theory of culture and its dependence on a fundamentally irrationalist philosophy: which is to say he offers a politics of the postmodern.,1
537,"There are two pillars to this account: the emergence in the post-war period, and more particularly in the last two decades, of a mass social layer analysable under the rubric of a new middle class — though internally much differentiated distinct from a traditional petite bourgeoisie its structured ‘overconsumptionism’.",1
538,"And secondly, the defeat of the last major challenge to the system associated with the overdetermined name of ‘1968’ but finally petering out in the mid-1970s.",1
539,"The latter is primary; the emergence, or acceleration, of the former a consequence of measures adopted by newly confident conservative states to cope with the re-entry of the world system into a succession of capitalist crises after the exhaustion of the Long Boom.",1
540,"This kind of argument reads well in Callinicos' hands, but it is worth reminding ourselves of the unattractive reality to which it bears witness.",1
541,A real tragedy has taken place.,1
542,"If one only takes educational institutions universities and colleges, the world outside, the emancipatory impulse of the sixties and early seventies has been turned .",1
543,"What began as a compelling rejection of a straitjacketing orthodoxy made its criticism a materialist demand that the socio-political locale of culture be addressed, in the face of an institutionalised aversion to any such examination conducted under a self-serving misrepresentation of the autonomy of art.",1
544,This stance has now been inverted by a puritanical moralising clerisy which virtually polices conduct and enquiry in the name of a postmodern triptych — as Terry Eagleton has put it — of class and race and gender.,1
545,"What amounts to a fear of art, perpetrated under a false rhetoric of care and defence of the marginalised now dominates everything this oxymoronic ‘radical orthodoxy’ touches.",1
546,And it touches a lot.,1
547,"Making all due allowance for the return of historical tragedy as farce, watching this soporific monolith of the virtuous rise the debris of a liberating movement is akin to nothing witnessing Bureaucracy emerge from the ashes of Revolution.",1
548,"It is one of Callinicos' main concerns to relate the constellation of ideas and cultural practices trading under a conception of the postmodern condition to an inadequate and escapist politics: the claim, as one of his own critics has had it, that ‘the conditions that sustain oppression can be altered piecemeal’(Patton, cited, p. 85).",1
549,Callinicos mordantly comments on the descent ‘from revolutionary groupuscule to single-issue campaigns and then to social democracy’.,1
550,"In sum then, while acknowledging the stature of some elements of this constellation, the historical aspects of Foucault's work or the critical élan of Fredric Jameson (not to mention the giant figure of Habermas), Callinicos develops a root and branch assault on claims for the cultural distinction of the ‘postmodern’, for the conceptual adequacy of its theoretical base, and above all for the deleterious political consequences of adherence to it.",1
551,"So far so good; or one might almost say, so unproblematic.",1
552,"Callinicos mobilises as powerful a body of argument and evidence as is readily conceivable against a variety of contemporary critics and theorists whose claims he sees, with justice, as a .",1
553,Thus far there is something almost conventional about the book's stance.,1
554,"It is possible — just — to imagine a relatively orthodox artist, critic or historian appreciating the demolition of postmodernism (if not the evidence of late capitalism's corruption and decay).",1
555,But this is the argument's main thrust; and it is this rather elusive second aspect which gives the book its definitive character.,1
556,"‘Elusive’ isn't quite the word, however.",1
557,It is more a matter of approaching the book's arguments from within a milieu of relatively academic contemporary art theory and being unable to see the wood for the trees.,1
558,"For the concomitant of Callinicos' critique of postmodernism is not, as it would be in half a hundred other cases, the defence of modernism.",1
559,"For one thing, Callinicos goes his way to establish that the intellectual tradition he is concerned to critique is itself most fruitfully read, not as an articulation of a qualitatively new postmodernism, but an instance of a Modernist-type response.",1
560,"Thus: ‘poststructuralism […$ the philosophical expression of Modernism, whose characteristic themes were indeed announced by Nietzsche’(p. 6); Nietzsche's ‘system of ideas’ is ‘in many respects a philosophical articulation of the main themes of Modernism’(p. 67).",1
561,"Callinicos is concerned to give weight to the proposition advanced by Franco Moretti Carl Schmitt, that it is not the task of Marxism to defend Modernism its devices were ‘inherently subversive of the existing social order’(p. 48).",1
562,"The point is that for Callinicos, Nietzschean thought is an instance of Romantic anti-capitalism: that form of refusal of the implications of capitalist modernity which has been present virtually since the birth of that condition, described by Michael Lowy as ‘opposition to capitalism in the name of pre-capitalist values’(cited p. 67).",1
563,"The consequence of this is that Modernism too must be a form of romantic anti-capitalism, and as such one-sided and vulnerable.",1
564,"The principal weakness of both the modernist tradition proper, and indeed of Nietzsche himself is, for Callinicos, their aestheticism.",1
565,It is as well to be clear on this.,1
566,"Callinicos' defence of classical Marxism, of historical materialism, is in the first instance deployed against a postmodernism which has come to proclaim the death of the grand narrative of emancipation and the need for a new form of politics not constructed along the lines of the traditional left.",1
567,"This defence of Marxism carries over, however, to a critique of Modernism itself: not merely for the fact that Nietzsche attaches ‘importance’ to art but for the further claim ascribed to him, and therefore to Modernism itself, that ‘the nature of aesthetic experience contains the form of understanding proper to the world itself (p. 66).",1
568,"In the end, , Callinicos pits historical materialism against not merely postmodernism but, following the logic that the latter is indistinguishable from Modernism properly conceived, against Modernism itself.",1
569,"Drawing largely on the Marshall Berman/Perry Anderson debate, and thereby making of Modernism the characteristic expression of the experience of modernity, itself conceived as a response to capitalist modernisation, Callinicos seems to want to claim in essence that both the former are partial the fact of this last.",1
570,"Weber's conceptualisation of the modern as a process of structural differentiation is, I think, seen to be echoed in Modernist claims for the specificity of art.",1
571,"Both are then held to be deficient Marx's conception of a ‘mode of production’which differentiation can be understood, made intelligible and ultimately accountable to a materialistically grounded ethics of emancipation rooted in a conception of a ‘complex’ totality.",1
572,It is this perspective that Callinicos was concerned to deny the common conflation by postmodernists of Modernism with the Enlightenment.,1
573,"From his point of view, Modernism as a sub-species of romantic anti-capitalism is one partial moment in the rejection of the consequences of Enlightenment properly understood: understood, , a Marxism which is itself held out as the genuine heir to the Enlightenment narrative of emancipation its romantic critique.",1
574,"Here lies the root of Callinicos, project — the buttressing of Marxism as the ‘true radicalisation’ of the Enlightenment; and here I suspect lies also his ultimate discomfort with Modernism — prone as it is to slip the leash of a guiding politics and dance under the less biddable star of the Aesthetic.",1
575,"At this point Callinicos has to be careful: it is one thing to dismiss the claims of a rootless postmodernism, wandering naked its designer trainers across the face of a barren late capitalism.",1
576,It is quite another also to offer a wholesale refutation of Modernism.,1
577,"And Callinicos is aware of this: ‘Is not the general tendency of this analysis similar to Lukács' celebrated denunciation of Modernism as ‘aesthetically appealing, but decadent’?(p. 53).",1
578,"For fairly obvious reasons, mostly connected with the spectre of Zhdanov and Socialist Realism (but also I suspect a more subterranean philosophical linkage between Callinicos' endorsement of Althusser's ‘complex totality’ against Lukács' ‘expressive totality’and the political voluntarism which it informed in the early twenties), Callinicos has to answer: No.",1
579,"This begins to be interesting, and it is I think the originary focus of that sense of misgiving with which I began.",1
580,"If I have been primarily expository hitherto (and I have been because I believe Callinicos' book to be the best on this subject that we have) I will now begin to turn to criticism; or to trying to ventilate that reservation which, faced by Callinicos, certainty, will not be stilled.",1
581,In a sense it doesn't matter if Callinicos' defence of Marxism is registered or not by the legion of Post-isms and -ists which form the undergrowth of contemporary cultural politics.,1
582,"They will wither at the first frosts anyway, if they come; and if they don't…",1
583,"But with his placement of Modernism in the lineage of Nietzsche, and as such at odds with Marx  and Freud as the real motors of that ‘true radicalisation of the Enlightenment’(p. 120) which is the only way ahead, something more serious is at stake.",1
584,"To backtrack , the case is perhaps not so monolithic as I have implied: for which we have to return to the detail of Callinicos' ‘No’ to Lukács.",1
585,"On the one hand — and this is a point to which I shall return — there is a dual claim against Lukács' evolutionism (to the effect that different levels of a social formation are relatively autonomous: crudely, if bourgeois society is decadent this does not necessarily mean, as Lukács thought it did, that its art is too), and the possibility of being able to pass a positive ‘aesthetic judgement’ upon a particular work however questionable the general category under which it has been produced (a position related to Brecht's polemic against Lukács).",1
586,"More empirically however, on the other hand, and drawing upon the work of Peter Bürger, Callinicos accepts the case for Modernism having contained a critical moment — a ‘protest against the capitalist society to which it is in complex ways related’(p. 53).",1
587,"This is principally indexed to the claimed historical transformation of Modernism into a series of engaged avant-gardes dedicated not to the aestheticisation of life, but to the integration of art into life.",1
588,As Bürger has it: ‘Aestheticism had made the distance from the praxis of life the content of works.,1
589,The business of the new configuration was different: art ‘transferred to the praxis of life’— not however ‘to integrate art into this praxis’ but ‘the attempt to organise a new life praxis from a basis in art’(cited p. 54).,1
590,"The ‘avant-garde’ here means, , constructivism, surrealism and a range of Weimar practices grouped by Callinicos somewhat misleadingly under the label ‘Neue Sachlichkeit’.",1
591,"Just how remote this stance in fact is from the aesthetic is a matter for further debate, but it is perhaps worth interpolating that the implied valorisation of the products of these engaged avant-gardes as a function of their engagement is defeasible.",1
592,"Contra Buchloh .,",1
593,"Callinicos, there is nothing as far as art (as distinct from culture or politics) is concerned which will privilege a Tatlin made in revolutionary Petrograd from a Matisse painted in a hotel bedroom on the Riviera — Benjamin on technique notwithstanding (don't forget: Benjamin owned a Klee).",1
594,"Be that as it may, these avant-gardes are held to have a ‘distinctive character’ which resides in their ‘seeking to abolish the separation between art and life’.",1
595,For Callinicos this is ‘unquestionable’; as is the fact that the shift is enabled by the Bolshevik revolution of 1917.,1
596,(These arguments owe much to Perry Anderson's location of the tripartite enabling conditions of the Modern movement as: a decrepit academicism; the presence of new technologies; and ‘the imaginative proximity of social revolution’.),1
597,For Callinicos it is October which made the vision of social transformation ‘concrete’.,1
598,"The downside of this, so to speak, is that the defeat of October's aspirations also marks the avant-garde's defeat.",1
599,‘Between them Stalinism and Nazism destroyed the .,1
600,"The political defeats of the 1930s ‘shipwreck’ the avant-garde, and furthermore, through a kind of extension (since one assumes Anderson's tripartite conjuncture fuelled even those Modernist forms which did not quite take the transformatory step into engaged avant-gardism) come to determine ‘the more general exhaustion of Modernism’.",1
601,"The end of the Second World War is marked by the incipient commodification of social life, and as such ‘the disintegration of the Modernist conjuncture’(pp. 60 — 1).",1
602,The problem then begins to stand clear and I shall now have to be brief and schematic.,1
603,Callinicos drives a coach and horses through postmodernism; well and good.,1
604,"But the roads on which he drives it also go through most of the art produced in the last half century — shall we say for the sake of convenience, since the death of Trotsky; or in a more apt frame of reference, since ?",1
605,"I will simply have to state the case dogmatically, but: this is untenable.",1
606,All of Callinicos' philosophical sophistication and matchless political experience evaporate in the face of the art of his own lifetime.,1
607,"the fact that he doesn't actually discuss it in any detail, there is little more than a disappointed huffing and puffing at the exhaustion of the avant-garde's shock value (backed up by a particularly crass quotation from Peter Bürger about Duchamp's readymades) and some utterly routine panting over the outlandish prices being currently paid for Van Goghs — plus a quotation from a sub-Warholian Manhattan ‘artist’ answering an art magazine questionnaire with a few smart remarks about business and producing art for the market.",1
608,this were adequate to underwrite a claim for the avant-garde's loss of critical virtue.,1
609,"In an extraordinary passage towards the end of the book, amplified in discussion at Marxism 90 in a debate specifically convened to discuss Modernism and Postmodernism, Callinicos described his experience of walking around an art gallery: ‘I have often been struck by the tedium that overcomes one while walking through a gallery of twentieth-century painting arranged in chronological order as one moves from the excitement of the early part of the century to the desperate and all too frequently sterile iconoclasm of recent artists' (p. 161).",1
610,"The specifics aren't clear, but the contextual indications are that this would include American art from say, Pollock to André, not to mention a range of contemporary work on commodification stemming from Warhol.",1
611,"All of which says more about Callinicos, and the limits on his knowledge and interests, than it does about the work.",1
612,"Whither Brecht now, on the lure of the good old days; not to mention the nostalgia laid at the door of romantic anti-capitalism?",1
613,I shall conclude briefly.,1
614,The point is I think that the argument from here can go two ways.,1
615,The first response is that it doesn't matter very much.,1
616,"Callinicos, defence of Marxism is erudite and compelling, and the fact that he runs steam over post-war art is of less moment than the fact that he takes the range of issues seriously enough to discuss them .",1
617,"Most sociologists, economists and politicians, after all, don't get that far.",1
618,"The second road is however rockier; and it is an undecided question whether its implications are depressing and frightening, or challenging and exhilarating.",1
619,"Callinicos is very careful to say, in two places in the book, that aesthetic judgement the value of a work of art is relatively independent of the cultural and philosophical critique of the bases from which it proceeds.",1
620,"Thus, in his discussion of Modernism Lukács and Brecht: ‘to highlight the fact that Modernism shares with Romanticism a ‘subjectified occasionalism, is not thereby to pass a negative aesthetic judgement on the works of art grouped together under the former label.",1
621,Brecht's polemic (i.e. against Lukács)[…]retains all its force today’(p. 53).,1
622,And again Postmodernism: ‘Nor does the argument set out in this section imply the dismissal of all recent works — including those described as ‘Postmodern’—— as worthless rubbish.,1
623,Good art can be produced in an immense variety of different conditions’(p. 161).,1
624,This magnanimity is precisely the problem.,1
625,The traffic is all one way.,1
626,"Callinicos appears to think that he can detect ‘aesthetic merit’ from the position given to him by his politics; politics, writ large, as embodying an ethics and a philosophy, is the active force.",1
627,Thus post-Second World War art is as it is —— with an ‘emphasis on the autonomous and abstract work of art’(p. 154)— allegedly the ‘effects’ of the stabilisation and extension of capitalism.,1
628,Cause and effect: what took place was a ‘flight into abstraction’.,1
629,"This is a language, a world view, a form of life perhaps, wherein one of the principal reasons for according praise to a type of art is that it is able to give voice to a politics; Bolshevism in the main case, though as Callinicos acknowledges, one of the salient points about Modernism was its ‘ambiguity, its capacity to express a variety of different political positions’; , when it was not engaged on its more usual ‘flight from politics’(p. 161).",1
630,"Art, it seems, is the perpetual recidivist, always ducking back into the aesthetic vigilant life averts its gaze.",1
631,"When times are bad and reactionary commodification sets in, the deleterious upshot is ‘the recuperation of the avant-garde for art’(p. 157).",1
632,"When things are on the up and the lodestar of a transformatory politics shines bright, so too does ‘the avant-garde project of overcoming the separation of art and life’(p. 171).",1
633,In this perspective it seems that Callinicos can only mean relatively little with his disclaimers about good art.,1
634,"The individual ‘good’ work might get thrown up, however unpropitious the circumstance.",1
635,But it can only be a quirk; and the force of its ‘goodness’ is strictly limited and circumscribed.,1
636,"Only once, in a fleeting reference to Matisse is there a sense of the boot being on the other foot, of art offering a sense of liberation from social ideology.",1
637,But even this is done in the name of a supposed ‘immediate sensuous charge’ any more extended critical capacity of art or the aesthetic.,1
638,", the whole thrust of the historic avant-garde, and particularly its celebration here, lies in its being associated with a liberation from bourgeois ideology; but this is not quite the same as having your revolutionary commitments tested by your aesthetic judgement.",1
639,"For the greater part, the aesthetic is bracketed in the name of a robust historical materialism.",1
640,"And there is no room for doubt which is the tail, and which the dog.",1
641,Walter Benjamin once implied something rather different.,1
642,"Speaking against social realism in ‘The Author as Producer’, he identifies a work's ‘political tendency’ and its ‘literary tendency’.",1
643,The relationship he postulates is not one-way traffic; it is dialectical.,1
644,A work ‘can only be politically correct if it is also literarily correct’.,1
645,"I take this to mean that there is an equality, a reciprocity between the aesthetic and the political an aesthetic dimension or response can give the lie to a political claim.",1
646,"The point of Benjamin's article seems to be to decentre the political, or to subject it to test, to remove those making claims for their political correctness from their habitual position of judge and jury: the art can, in principle, sort out the politics, and not just .",1
647,"It is this, in the end, which I find disquieting about Callinicos' book.",1
648,Not the vapidity of the postmodern which it reveals.,1
649,But the way in which the very limits of its historical materialism (which I take to be the most developed statement of the case available in English) put back on the agenda questions one had considered closed.,1
650,"The critique of Nietzsche's apocalyptic aestheticism, with its injunction to build your dwelling on the slopes of Vesuvius, just cannot be reduced to the cliché about Baudrillard fiddling while Rome burns with which the book closes.",1
651,(Is it anyway such a bad thing to make music while Atlantis sinks and cities evaporate?,1
652,"you would have to be a doctor to say so, and not a politician or an academic.)",1
653,"A requirement to minimise, even to trivialise the aesthetic — one might almost say, a fear of the aesthetic — is the hollowness at the heart of historical materialism as it is defended here.",1
654,There is obviously a problem concerning the subjective dimension of the aesthetic.,1
655,But a tame aesthetic is no friend of historical materialism.,1
656,"Art has to be more than an ornament, or a reinforcement.",1
657,"There has to be the possibility that the politics can be put at risk by the aesthetics, or the relationship each of its components will be inert.",1
658,"An unpredictable aesthetic, it could be said, is a requirement of an historical materialism adequate to its political task.",1
659,"If the aesthetic is genuinely to  have reciprocal leverage upon the political, certain problems have to be faced.",1
660,", what goes on when looking at, say, a Matisse in an art gallery.",1
661,"It is easy to say that the time spent considering the Matisse is time better spent than that spent considering a Gerasimov, a Bouguereau.",1
662,(It is a terminal problem with the race n'class n'gender triptych that all these transactions are equivalently sociological.),1
663,But what of time spent otherwise?,1
664,How to adjudicate?,1
665,"The problem goes inescapably to a notion of the quality of experience (though what we are calling the aesthetic here is not, or not only, a question of intensity).",1
666,"The relationship between, say, reading an article in on the bureaucracy's pursuit of revenge on Arthur Scargill, and what it is that can be got from staring at Rembrandt's nose in a late self-portrait just is open.",1
667,One is not more important than the other.,1
668,"Which is also to say that it is not the case that there is no connection, or that a category mistake is involved in the mere comparison.",1
669,The information about Arthur should bear upon how one regards the Rembrandt.,1
670,But the way Rembrandt's nose is worked should equally provide a corrective to rhetoric or elision in the writing on bureaucracy.,1
671,"Which is to say, the political commentary is a form of writing.",1
672,"Or, to use an unfashionable term in these linguistic days, of thought.",1
673,And it is of the utmost importance to realise that the pragmatic answer to these questions is itself what makes the revolution never happen.,1
674,Which latter is not however to say that ‘correct thinking’ overturns society.,1
675,"Thought and organisation, or aesthetics and politics, must circle warily, the one never letting the other its sight.",1
676,"The abyss which all this opens up is, perhaps, terrifying before it is ‘depressing’.",1
677,I have mentioned Walter Benjamin here.,1
678,Callinicos concludes his book by invoking the memory of Benjamin to the effect that socialist revolution in the form of an irruption into history is the secular vehicle of a redemption hitherto conceivable only in mystic terms.,1
679,"For Callinicos it is a belief in this possibility, and that alone, which remainders melancholy and irony — , Modernism — as an adequate response to modern life.",1
680,"It is the consequence — presumably unintended — of his argument, however, that it demonstrates so irrevocably how much this is a matter of commitment and as such beyond the reach of proof.",1
681,"One could say that the pressing question is how it is possible to live, what teleology to adopt; or that the latter does not sort the former out.",1
682,"Benjamin remarked, tellingly, that it is less a question of what a man's beliefs are than the kind of man those beliefs make of him.",1
683,This is no less an aesthetic matter than a political one.,1
684,"Callinicos, in his haste to counter aestheticism, reduces the aesthetic.",1
685,He has to.,1
686,Yet the aesthetic will not be reduced.,1
687,"It is not the means to an end conceived elsewhere: but an ‘’, no less substantial than the of revolution itself.",1
688,"Value, you say?",1
689,"Pushkin eating cherries before a duel; Lenin working day in day out on Iskra; one sentence or a newspaper (the point is , not one without the other); Benjamin on the requirement to denature your work ‘like ethyl alcohol’ lest it be of use to the other side.",1
690,"For revolutions may occur, but the belief that they will does not of itself ensure a better lived life.",1
691,"truth and beauty — the truth can doubtless beautiful, though it need not be.",1
692,"Certain kinds of one-way traffic, certain kinds of one-way street, are in the end not hard to negotiate.",1
693,Their avoidance may be more difficult .,1
694,And there is always the possibility — the necessity?— that beauty can be its own truth.,1

696,THE ART OF SCIENCE,1
697,GEOFFREY CANTOR,1
698,"The Science of Art: Optical Themes in Western Art from Brunelleschi to Seurat, Martin Kemp, Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1990. pp. viii — 375; 554 black and white illustrations — 16 colour plates.",1
699,ISBN 0 — 300 — 04337 — 6. £49.,1
700,"In a heady essay written over thirty years ago, Giorgio de Santillana argued that some of the key ideas of the Scientific Renaissance were to be traced to developments in the arts.",1
701,", the idea of space was transformed from the Aristotelian conception — a ‘tidy arrangement of a simple multiplicity of things, not unlike, let us say, the shipping department of SearsRoebuck-— into ‘a matrix for infinite potential complexities and states and tensions’.",1
702,"The main innovators of this transformation were not scientists but artists, especially Alberti, Brunelleschi and Leonardo, who created on their canvases and in their architecture and treatises a new conception of space.",1
703,When I first encountered de Santillana's paper in the late 1960s I found it both fascinating and suggestive.,1
704,"Its attraction arose principally from its iconoclastic message, for de Santillana explained one of the key conceptual innovations in the rise of modern science in terms that challenged the assumptions of my teachers in the history of science.",1
705,"They had argued that the new ideas about space and motion had arisen from an intellectual and, to a much lesser extent, empirical critique of the preceding, largely Anstotelian, notions.",1
706,"Discussion of this transformation was confined to the great tradition of philosopher-scientists beginning with Aristotle, continuing with medieval authors, Oresme and Jordanus, and ending with Kepler, Galileo, Descartes and, , Newton.",1
707,De Santillana offered a very different account of the new ideas of space and a different cast of actors.,1
708,"Most importantly, he claimed that the new science was not the progeny of earlier science but the outgrowth of developments in the practical arts.",1
709,In his account the history of art and the history of science were intrinsically linked: in the late 1960s this was an heretical claim to most historians of science (and probably many historians of art).,1
710,Although sympathetic to this heresy I found myself intoxicated but also somewhat inhibited by de Santillana's impressionistic style.,1
711,"However exciting his paper, his thesis seemed in danger of crumbling if it were reworked into a conventional historical discourse.",1
712,"In the book under review, Martin Kemp reexamines the art-science relationship with much care and circumspection.",1
713,His style is lucid and he emerges as an honest broker who judiciously weighs the historical evidence.,1
714,He has an impressive command of the literature of both art and optical science across much of Europe and over a span of four centuries.,1
715,"In contrast to de Santillana's uninterrupted thirty pages of text, Kemp's thesis is amply illustrated with several hundred plates, including many of his own line drawings showing artists' deployment of visual angles, vanishing points, etc.",1
716,The reader is led gently through the history of art and the details of optical science to appreciate their interrelationship.,1
717,"Albeit less impressionistic and insightful, Kemp's analysis is of broader scope and greater clarity than de Santillana's.",1
718,Kemp identifies optics as a topic of common concern to both art and science.,1
719,(In a sequel he proposes to pursue the role of anatomy and natural history in the history of art.),1
720,Of the many interweaving strands within this extensive topic he concentrates primarily on the way artists have deployed scientific ideas and instruments — these connections constitute ‘the science of art’ of his title —— while he also encompasses a number of related themes.,1
721,"The science of art, claims Kemp, has not been adequately appreciated by art historians and to begin to rectify the situation he strives to demonstrate that ‘there were special kinds of affinity between the central intellectual and observational concerns in the visual arts and the sciences, in European history between the Renaissance and the nineteenth century (p. 1).",1
722,In the first of the book's three sections Kemp examines the theory and practice of perspective from Brunelleschi to Turner.,1
723,"The second section, which is less focused and less easy to characterise, contains discussion of perspective machines and other technical aids theories of perception.",1
724,The final section is concerned with the theory and depiction of colour.,1
725,In the first section one of Kemp's main themes is the relationship between theoria and praxis.,1
726,"Renaissance artists confronting the problem of portraying spatial arrangement, responded by developing linear perspective.",1
727,The initial emphasis was on praxis.,1
728,"Following the first crude attempts by Giotto, Lorenzetti and others, Brunelleschi got it right.",1
729,"Then, in the mid-1430s, Alberti the theorist codified the system.",1
730,The basic rules of linear perspective were now accessible to any artist.,1
731,Theoria could influence praxis.,1
732,The relation between the theory and practice of  perspective over the next four centuries is examined in detail.,1
733,Textbooks flourished making the rules of perspective available to aspiring artists.,1
734,"Codifiers produced ever more elaborate schemes for the depiction of spatial arrangements, often thereby rendering their work incomprehensible to the practising artist.",1
735,"Artists, architects and draughtsmen experimented with the new schemes since the theory of perspective offered exciting possibilities to depict the spatial relations between bodies.",1
736,"Thus the eye could be subjected to precise ‘reality’, or it could be repositioned, led, titillated or deceived.",1
737,Some of the most fascinating material in this book is provided by the uses of perspective to create illusions — Mantegna's Camera degli Sposi (1465 — 74) and Pozzo's dome of San Ignazio (1685).,1
738,"Moreover, Kemp hints at the diverse uses of perspective which offer a rich commentary on European history.",1
739,In the third and final section of the book Kemp addresses the use and theory of colours.,1
740,He argues that in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries many artists adopted versions of the Aristotelian theory which asserted that colours are a mixture of black and white in different proportions.,1
741,They also often used constructively the analogy between colours and the harmonic scale.,1
742,"However, Newton's theory of light and colours, first published in 1672 and extended in his (1704), provided a new direction for colour theorists.",1
743,"In opposition to Aristotle , Newton showed with his prism that white light is a mixture of its composite colours.",1
744,"Moreover, in the he identified seven colours in the spectrum and described a circle divided into seven segments that could be used to account for colour mixing.",1
745,Newton's views were subsequently both elaborated and criticised.,1
746,Colour circles became ever more elaborate and orientated towards the practice of colour-mixing — witness those of Moses Harris (c. 1770) and Michel-Lugène Chevreul (1839).,1
747,Louis Castel exploited the analogy between light and sound with his ‘Ocular clavichord’ and Goethe explored subjective colours.,1
748,For their part artists were experimenting and drawing on the insights provided by the colour theorists.,1
749,Delacroix took Chevreul seriously.,1
750,"Turner, always alive to new ideas, responded creatively to both Harris and Goethe.",1
751,"Seurat paid close attention to both Helmholtz's (1867) and Ogden Rood's (1879) which, in turn, was based on James Clerk Maxwell's three-colour theory of vision.",1
752,Such a brief summary does not do justice to the detail and complexity of Kemp's argument.,1
753,"Optics provides a superb locus for examining the art-science relationship since optical problems, theories and constructions were integral to both science and art.",1
754,To admit that much is not to foreclose the question of defining that relationship since a nuanced understanding requires the command of historical detail that Kemp provides.,1
755,"Viewed from the late twentieth century and the widespread acceptance of the ‘two cultures’, the search for affinities between art and science possesses particular significance for the historian.",1
756,"Yet, by viewing history in this manner Kemp encounters an historiographical difficulty that he never satisfactorily resolves.",1
757,This problem surfaces even in his introduction in which he states that his concern is to show how artists ‘consciously aspired towards goals that as scientific in a broad sense’(p. 1).,1
758,Part of this passage has been italicised to draw attention to the somewhat presentist presupposition that underpins much of this book.,1
759,In qualifying ‘scientific’ by ‘in a broad sense’Kemp shows that he is aware of this problem.,1
760,"However, the presentist influence is all too pervasive.",1
761,His frequent appeals to ‘scientific concepts’ and ‘scientific ideas’often presuppose an unambiguous definition of science and one that is atemporal.,1
762,The difficulty is most apparent when discussing the Renaissance since by hypostatising science and art as two separate and separable activities Kemp is framing a problem that did not exist for the historical actors.,1
763,"Take the example of Brunelleschi who, Kemp, introduced ‘scientific consistency’ into his use of perspective (p. 14).",1
764,The phrase suggests that Brunelleschi was engaging in an activity art.,1
765,Was he doing science?,1
766,"And if so, would he and his contemporaries have recognised that in pursuing this consistency he was doing science, not art?",1
767,"Again, how were science and art demarcated in the early fifteenth century —— socially, intellectually and institutionally?",1
768,Kemp's difficulty in defining ‘science’ and ‘art’is not confined to his discussion of the earlier period.,1
769,", in his appraisal of the eighteenth century he uses ‘scientific’ and ‘Newtonian’as predicates to create the impression of an hypostasised activity which stood separate from art and other aspects of Western culture, including philosophy.",1
770,"Thus we are told that Brook Taylor, the author of the first major British work on perspective (1715), was ‘a professional Newtonian scientist’(p. 287).",1
771,"Although Taylor was active in the Royal Society, both predicates misrepresent this English gentleman who wrote extensively on mathematics and religion.",1
772,"Likewise, his over-rigid use of categories, Kemp characterises David Brewster, the most eulogistic of Newton's nineteenth-century biographers, as an ‘anti-Newtonian’(p. 300).",1
773,A related and equally significant problem arises from Kemp's search for causal historical relations between science and art.,1
774,Questions of historical influence feature prominently in this study.,1
775,Kemp frequently provides details of superficial social acquaintance between scientists and artists and refers to their reading habits.,1
776,"This is, in one sense, unobjectionable and Kemp rightly weighs the evidence for influence circumspectly.",1
777,"However, the very preoccupation with identifying causal influences begs more fundamental questions about whether contemporaries shared intellectual assumptions.",1
778,", the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century was constituted not only by the new theories of Descartes, Galileo and Newton but also by new ways of experiencing the world, interacting with it and thinking about it.",1
779,"this claim, the mores of the eighteenth century were radically different from the sixteenth.",1
780,Yet this difference is somewhat obscured in Kemp's analysis by his concern to explicate the details of numerous perspective schemes and the techniques employed by artists.,1
781,He thereby pays less attention than he might to interpreting the science of art as a cultural phenomenon.,1
782,"Ideological and philosophical issues receive inadequate attention and yet these could have helped define the common context (or, perhaps, the contrasting contexts) in which art and science were pursued.",1
783,"Again, Kemp's subject raises important questions about the structure and function of institutions which he only engages parenthetically.",1
784,"More generally, a less causal and more structural approach might have been fruitful in illuminating the historical conditioning of the science of art.",1
785,Another example of a terminological difficulty arises in the section in which Kemp briefly examines the relation between perspective and eighteenth-century theories of perception.,1
786,"Unfortunately he predicates his discussion on the contrast between ‘empiricists’ and ‘nativists’, a distinction he soon recognises as inadequate.",1
787,"Kemp's historiography, it is not surprising that he concludes that ideas about perception (which were often explicitly discussed by ‘scientists’ and ‘philosophers') had little impact on artists (p. 237).",1
788,"While he has usefully identified theories of perception as an aspect of the science of art, they deserve a more eclectic and sustained analysis.",1
789,Let me therefore mention briefly some further dimensions of the subject.,1
790,"Many artists, scientists and philosophers engaged the question of whether linear (or any other) perspective provides the true account of how we perceive.",1
791,For some authors perspective provides both the laws of perception and also the key to the true and rational representation of objects.,1
792,Learn perspective and you can imitate nature precisely.,1
793,"However, many artists seriously questioned this wisdom.",1
794,In their art they combined perspective with drawing ‘by eye’; they instinctively knew when to follow the rules and when to break them.,1
795,"This, for Kemp, is an important clue to the success of Velázquez and Turner for whom perspective was a useful servant but a poor master.",1
796,But artists were not alone in considering and debating the truth and limitations of perspective.,1
797,"A related point on which most (but not all) physical scientists (or, more appropriately, natural philosophers) of the seventeenth century would have agreed, was the primacy of mathematics in analysing the physical universe.",1
798,"Their reasons for adopting this view differed somewhat, but we can take Galileo's position as not atypical.",1
799,"Echoing Plato, Galileo claimed that God had created the world mathematical proportions.",1
800,This implied that only in the sphere of the mathematical sciences can the human intellect attain knowledge that is as objective and as certain as it is known to the divine mind.,1
801,Through mathematics truth and reality could be laid bare and appearances transcended.,1
802,This metaphysical commitment came under scrutiny not only from those artists who refused to be limited by the laws of perspective but also from ‘scientists’ and ‘philosophers’.,1
803,One of the most forceful attacks was by George Berkeley in his (1709).,1
804,Here Berkeley argued strenuously against the view that we judge the distance of objects lines and angles.,1
805,"Although most commentators have claimed that Berkeley's principal opponent was Descartes, whom he cited as an example only in the second (1710) edition, he was more generally denying the widely-received assumption that we see the laws of geometry — this assumption being central to the perspectivist tradition.",1
806,"(Berkeley was familiar with perspective machines, one of which he described in a later work.)",1
807,"Instead, Berkeley sought to show that we learn to judge the distance, magnitude and situation of objects.",1
808,This controversial book was widely discussed but whether it was read by artists I leave to further research.,1
809,"Berkeley was not alone in questioning whether geometrical methods are adequate to account for visual perception since there was a large literature on the subject by ‘scientists’ and, as Kemp shows, artists also frequently commented on it.",1
810,One of the leading problems in this area was the horizontal moon illusion: the moon appears larger near the horizon than in its zenith.,1
811,"Since Ptolemy tried to solve this problem in the second century, it has been on the agenda of theorists of perception and is still, I understand, not fully resolved.",1
812,In the eighteenth century it was one of the main test cases for the dominance of geometry.,1
813,"Attacks on geometrically-based theories of vision (together with the deployment of such examples as the horizontal moon illusion) provide a theme of common concern to artists, scientists and philosophers and deserve further analysis than Kemp offers.",1
814,"If there are aspects of the science of art that Kemp fails to engage adequately, the scope of this book is nevertheless very impressive and a number of the issues he discusses impinge on my concerns as an historian of science.",1
815,Let me allude to two of these issues.,1
816,In the history of science theoria has usually been accorded far greater importance than praxis.,1
817,The general view has been that theoria is the engine driving the historical development of science and that praxis is merely the application of theoria.,1
818,"Although some historians, often Marxists, have rejected this consensus, only recently have aspects of praxis, laboratory skills, been subjected to close and sustained study.",1
819,In this respect the  historian of science has much to learn from an art historian like Kemp.,1
820,"Moreover, the analysis of skills provides a common topic of research for both art and science historians.",1
821,The second issue concerns the art-science relationship which Kemp analyses through the history of perspective and of colour.,1
822,The latter case is the more straightforward since he presents the impact of Newton's theory of coloured light as radically reorientating this area.,1
823,"With perspective, the key figures of the Scientific Revolution are presented as the heirs to developments in art.",1
824,", we encounter Galileo as a bit-player who corresponded with Lodovico Cigoli over his lunar and sunspot observations.",1
825,"More particularly, Galileo used standard perspective procedures in accounting for the foreshortening of the spots which he claimed in 1613 were on the surface of the sun.",1
826,Unfortunately Kepler receives even less attention.,1
827,"Yet in 1600 Kepler made important contributions to optical science, especially to the theory of image formation.",1
828,Kepler's concern with the formation of images was a response to a practical problem.,1
829,He noticed that when viewed with a the image of the sun was too large but this enlargement was not explained by existing theory.,1
830,"Instead, he conceived every illuminated point being the source of rays spreading in all directions; a bundle of these rays (a single ray) pass through the hole in a (or the pupil of the eye).",1
831,Thus the image is enlarged the finite size of the hole.,1
832,In his resolution of the problem Kepler represented his rays by strings.,1
833,", in ascertaining the image of a book on a distant plane, he adopted a procedure familiar to artists for almost a century.",1
834,He used a stretched string to plot ray paths that just grazed the book in their transit from the source of the screen.,1
835,This method of repeatedly deploying a stretched string to plot the light rays and thus ascertain selected points on an image was incorporated into the perspective machines described by Leonardo and Dürer.,1
836,"While the example of Kepler illustrates the influence of artistic practice on a ‘scientist’(which is not Kemp's primary concern), discussion of this instance would have enhanced considerably the author's argument that both the theory and practice of perspective were significant resources for the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century.",1
837,"He also argues that, in its turn, the Scientific Revolution had some effect on the visual arts.",1
838,"Military engineers, who were also often mathematicians, Simon Stevin and Girard Desargues, contributed significantly to the subject of perspective.",1
839,"Newton is portrayed as influencing eighteenth-century perspective in an unspecified manner, although his effect on colour theory is seen as considerable.",1
840,"However, on Kemp's account few artists took notice of the philosophical, mathematical and scientific innovations of Descartes and Kepler.",1
841,"By the eighteenth century there was a considerable parting of the ways since the more erudite mathematical treatises on perspective, those by Lambert and Monge, were of no use to the practising artist.",1
842,"Even optical instruments, perspective machines, the and the camera lucida, were used sparingly.",1
843,"It appears that once science gained its independent identity, scientists and artists used perspective for increasingly different purposes.",1
844,As with de Santillana's innovatory essay Kemp's book not only offers new ways of understanding the history of science and the history of art but it also raises a host of historical and historiographical questions.,1
845,These questions in turn suggest further lines of research that deserve serious attention by historians of both science and art.,1
846,Kemp has performed a valuable service in opening up this area.,1
847,I hope other historians will now follow his lead.,1

864,"includes only two synoptical essays, the rest being made up of a selection of documents produced in various parts of Europe and Britain from the fifties to the eighties, some of which predate the founding of the Situationist International (henceforth the ‘SI').",1
865,"These are followed by documents relating to the SI in Britain which include Ralph Rumney's (1957), and brief statements by Michèle Bernstein which appear in the British press in the 1950s and 1960s.",1
866,The greater part of the Scrapbook largely consists of what the editor identifies as ‘the British inheritance’ which covers the period from 1966 — 1988.,1
867,The book is therefore very much an account of the movement's influence in Britain.,1
868,"The Boston text relates more exclusively to the movement itself and includes, historical material, a brief statement by Mark Francis which is intended to justify and explain the motives behind the exhibition (the Situationists did not give the event their blessings and none of the past members participated in its planning).",1
869,"‘What we have sought to do’, claims Francis speaking for the organisers of the exhibition, ‘is not to reconstruct time past but to expose to the light things that have run the risk of acquiring the patina of nostalgia and the glamour of neglect.’",1
870,If this statement betrays a certain uneasiness it is perhaps not surprising given the subversive status of the Situationist project and their condemnation of the art world.,1
871,"Francis also implies, somewhat unconvincingly, that the event was conceived in a spirit of Potlatch and accepts the Lettrist belief in the legitimate use of plagiarism.",1
872,"The Lettrists and the Situationists had used ‘pre-existing elements’ for their own ends, and so the editors of the Boston text and the curators of have, they feel, a certain entitlement to do the same.",1
873,"This legitimation in turn is related to the principle of , a term which had been coined initially by the Lettrists for their neo-Dadaist practice of cannibalising pre-existent materials (in the manner of Duchamp's ) with subversive intent.",1
874,My view of the exhibition and these complementary texts is that they seem to lack the critical motivation and the dialectical irony of the Situationists.,1
875,"They are normative representations, reverential in tone, recuperative in effect and the ideological positions which they reflect are conveniently distanced from those of the SI.",1
876,Self-evidently these texts are strikingly different from original materials issued by the SI in the sense that they have the status of copyrighted property and have been funded by organisations which in the past may have supported progressive art but which do not sound like the champions of revolutionary causes.,1
877,"The Boston text, , is published with the assistance of the Getty Grant Program, Massachusetts Council of the Arts and the Humanities, and additional funding is provided by the Lila Wallace Reader's Digest Fund (the benefactor of the American Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York).",1
878,"The Scrapbook is also variously supported by Association Française d'Action Artistique, the Ministry of Culture, Copenhagen, the Instituo Banco San Paulo of Turin, Becks Bier, to name some of the backers, and also by the furtively named Friends of the Situationist International, whoever they are!",1
879,"More prosaically, the sandpaper cover (which, like the Jorn/Debord text of  1959, is meant to damage your other books) was donated by English Abrasives and Chemicals Ltd.",1
880,One of the first ‘political’ statements in the Boston text is the copyright restriction notice.,1
881,It appears a few lines the plagiarised title of the book.,1
882,"The proscription is, , a legal convention which we would normally take for granted, but is, in this context, inconsistent with the SI anti-copyright policy and, the Lautréamont axiom: ‘Plagiarism is necessary — progress implies it,’ which Francis cites on page 19, is an unintended irony.",1
883,"The Boston text is more obviously an exhibition catalogue, if only because it includes a ‘checklist’ of the exhibition, which, ignoring the problematic identity of some of the works, distinguishes between works of art and other items (books, tracts, pamphlets, etc.) and also carefully identifies the status of individual exhibits by signifying their producer's relationship to the formally identified Situationist group.",1
884,"There is another category for Situationist wannabees, which was an additional and problematical area of both books and the exhibition.",1
885,"Some of the materials in this area seemed to have the purpose of padding out the exhibition, whilst at the same time fulfilling the traditional function of consolidating the achievements of the founding group whose significance it was the purpose of the exhibition to celebrate.",1
886,Francis identifies the stages of the SI narrative as a chronological trajectory corresponding to (i) the Experimental Laboratory period;(ii) the detonator period (which refers to Debord's boast that he provided the explosive machinery that ignited in May 1968);(iii) the Fallout period after the SI disbanded in 1972.,1
887,These stages provide the logic for the ‘diachronic structure’ of the exhibition.,1
888,"In the Fallout section are included artists, writers and others ‘who all had (sic) some contact with the SI’.",1
889,Periodisation and classification present some difficulties which Wollen hints at when he comments on ‘the ‘simulationist’ art boom of the eighties and its debt to the dry husks of Situationist thought’.,1
890,It is to be regretted that neither of these books examine the pluralism of the ‘simulationist’ period.,1
891,"To the extent that the Situationists raised questions about cultural hierarchies and the ‘supersession’ of art, how should we judge the Fallout period?",1
892,"The notion of progression is clearly important in assessing this work, especially as the temptation to isolate, or even dismiss, it as an epiphenomenon of the SI is strong.",1
893,The materials displayed in the exhibition and reproduced in the Fallout section of the Scrapbook express ideas about which strong convictions are held.,1
894,"What are these convictions, and why are they not articulated?",1
895,Why were the exhibits left to speak for themselves?,1
896,"It seems extraordinary that, given the political fervour of the Paris-based SI fraction in its post-Lettrist phase, the exhibition should have been so solemnly organised with little regard to Debord's caveat on auteurism and his contempt for the art market.",1
897,"Whatever objectives the organisers might have had, the exhibition turned out to be a quite normative curatorial project.",1
898,The contradiction is perhaps a familiar one.,1
899,As Debord has commented: ‘This society signs a peace treaty with its most outspoken enemies by giving them a spot in the spectacle.',1
900,"It is noteworthy that the Situationists have produced nothing in the way of new projects for these texts, nor for the exhibition.",1
901,Predictably they kept their distance.,1
902,At the centre of the re-grouped SI in 1961 Bernstein and Debord refused any separation between artistic and political activity.,1
903,"It was at this time that Asgerjorn resigned his membership of the SI, although he continued to finance it through the sale of his paintings which were increasingly in demand in the 1960s.",1
904,"Thus re-grouped, the SI increased their political activity, eliminating all artistic production except agitational forms which meant, essentially, the use of illustrations in their publications.",1
905,The article by Wollen is an important piece of research and a major contribution to both anthologies.,1
906,"Despite its usefulness as an introduction to the subject, it does, however, judiciously avoid overt criticism of its subject and devotes little analysis to the SI in its mature phase.",1
907,"Nevertheless, Wollen presents a lucid account of the movement in its formative period and makes an interesting case for André Breton as a figure of some distinction in French intellectual history.",1
908,"He also traces the Hegelian, and Lukácsian influences on leftist theories in France in the heightened intellectual atmosphere after the Liberation which provided the aesthetic and political context for the Situationists.",1
909,"Wollen's historical and theoretical essay, the other major contribution in the Boston text is Thomas Y. Levin's ‘Dismantling the Spectacle: The Cinema of Guy Debord’.",1
910,This is again a comprehensive and thoroughly investigated article and is probably the first extended account of Situationist cinema in English.,1
911,Levin makes a special case for Debord as a film-maker whose aim was to contribute to the ultimate destruction of cinema as a spectacularist medium.,1
912,Debord's cinema for Levin is a paradigmatic vehicle for the movement's ‘destructive creativity’.,1
913,"The main purpose of Levin's article, however, is to reclaim Debord for the aesthetic discourse of avant-garde cinema.",1
914,", he identifies Debord as the source of Godard's innovations: ‘Indeed, well over a decade before Godard's , Debord was producing a revolutionary, materialist ‘counter-cinema’.’",1
915,"Not having seen Debord's films (he refused screenings at the ICA in London), Levin's arguments are in one sense untestable; nevertheless the article is not without difficulties.",1
916,"Defensively, he observes what he considers to be Debord's virtues and comments on the latter's avoidance of, as he puts it: ‘the various pitfalls — formalist essentialism, aestheticist myopia, politically naive fetishism of reflexivity, , typical of certain avant-garde practices linked to radical political agendas.’",1
917,"Nevertheless, Debord's place within a reified history of ‘political modernism’ is assured, more by virtue of what is claimed for the work than by its testing — Levin admits that screenings have been rare, especially outside France.",1
918,Both the personality and the work remain famously obscure in a way which seems almost contrived.,1
919,"Further to this, Levin claims that Debord ‘does not disparage pleasure’ and yet argues elsewhere in the essay that his films deliberately refuse to make concessions to the viewer.",1
920,"An example of this is the early Lettrist film , with its long periods of blank screen and extended silences.",1
921,"As far as one can assess the merit of Levin's text its subject, it seems somewhat implausible that Debord can be all the things for which he is proclaimed.",1
922,"Whatever defence is mounted, it is clear that these films, for Levin, exist as auratic objects, and Debord their auraticised progenitor.",1
923,"Hence the mythologisation of Debord by Levin, and others, has a significant bearing upon the reception of his work.",1
924,His remoteness and the scandal and intrigue associated with the SI have significantly contributed to the enhancement of the movement's reputation.,1
925,"Levin's essay, interesting though it is, achieves little more than assimilating Debord into the spectacularised history of the avant-garde cinema.",1
926,His hero-worship results in him reiterating the same claims that the cinéaste makes for himself.,1
927,"In the opening sequence of , as Levin notes, Debord provides the audience with a reference to a cinematic tradition in which his own work is putatively situated.",1
928,"The tradition includes ‘great landmarks’ in film history from early ‘genre classics,(Levin's term), Expressionist, Dada, Soviet cinema of the 1920s, Surrealist, Chaplin, Lettrist and last, but not least, Debord.",1
929,"Situationist cinema is therefore important, indeed, self-important, not least because it provides ‘an alternative sort of cinematic activity, incompatible with the economy of the spectacle’.",1
930,Levin earnestly considers Situationist film to be an effective oppositional practice.,1
931,"One of the attractions for Levin is the persistency with which Debord, like the Dadaists before him, continued to explore the medium, whilst contributing to its eventual destruction.",1
932,"Moreover, Levin claims that the Situationists never lost sight of their own contradictions, ‘by consenting to act culture’ as a precondition of their co-existence in the present order.",1
933,"Nevertheless, cinema ultimately retains a relative autonomy in Levin's tribute.",1
934,It is like Hegel's notion of the beautiful soul which denounces the world from which it has withdrawn to avoid having to recognise the extent of its participation in its disorder.,1
935,"Debord, as a film-maker, and Levin, as his apologist, take refuge in the transcendental space of autonomy where meanings have the illusion of self-regulation and independence of the totality they represent.",1
936,"Debord takes up his place (certainly in Levin's account) within the lineage of modern masters with its attendant construction of patriarchy, distinction and causal succession.",1
937,"In Levin's essay, avant-garde cinema is assimilated into the wider discourse of Modernist art despite their material and institutional differences.",1
938,One of the pitfalls of this is that different audiences and different modes of consumption are contingencies largely ignored.,1
939,Debord's apparent contempt for audiences has its counterpart in Levin's emphasis upon origination and prestige as paradigms of his cultural history.,1
940,The blurring of art and film histories leads Levin into the murky waters of Situationist discourse on art.,1
941,"Suffice it to say that this discourse is generalising and intemperate, and lacks depth and clarity.",1
942,"Debord, , proclaims: ‘The critical position later elaborated by the Situationists has shown that the suppression and realization of art are inseparable aspects of a single supersession of art.'",1
943,"There is some sense in this comment which may well explain the position of the Situationists at a particular conjunction, but it is a sense which would also explain earlier avant-garde trends in art (if not cinema) since, say, Futurism.",1
944,"Moreover, the notion of art's ‘single supersession’, an histrionic claim, would benefit from some kind of historical and theoretical contextualisation.",1
945,It sounds important but in fact is an impenetrable statement.,1
946,Further clarification might also be required how the Situationist negation of art (and cinema) related to the wider sphere of cultural-political struggle.,1
947,"The critique of art as an institution is continuous with earlier formations (including early Surrealism and Russian Constructivism), but Levin remains unclear in his definition of Debord's avant-gardism.",1
948,"For Lukács and Adorno the concept of the avant-garde was a touchstone: for the one it was negative and decadent, for the other positive and progressive.",1
949,"In Levin's account of Debord, his subject appears to hold both positions .",1
950,"More specifically, on the issue of cultural hierarchies and class relations the Situationists tried to distance themselves from bourgeois notions of progress and their equivalence in the neo-avant-garde of the post-war period.",1
951,"The SI thus rejected ‘mechanical becoming, with its notions of progress, merit and causal succession’.",1
952,"This statement reflects the resistance of the SI to piecemeal historicism which lineages are made, but in Levin's history the independent achievements of Debord as a film-maker eventually collapses into it.",1
953,"In fairness it has to be said that Levin tries to isolate Debord from a purely formal Modernism, and from naive realism (the politics of the signified).",1
954,"He does this by proclaiming, a ‘third avant-garde’, which avoids the major pitfalls (of the ‘two avant-gardes') and secures some theoretical authority for Debord.",1
955,"However, because this is not adequately related to the political ideals of the SI there is no analysis of the projected  means (theoretical or practical) by which the sublation of art in the praxis of life might be achieved.",1
956,"The reverential tone of Levin's text poses a problem which the movement's survivors, I imagine, would be quick to condemn.",1
957,"It is, , uncritical in the sense of failing to site Debord's films within an adequate theoretical discourse.",1
958,"Levin objectifies his subject through the use of an argument which leaves the SI unexplained as a revolutionary organisation with the potentiality of reflecting, by its own methods, a radical social transformation.",1
959,"What he provides is the missing chapter in the secret history of the cinema, the missing link between Berlin Dada and postmodernism.",1
960,"As with other contributors, exaggerated claims are made for (the communication which contains its own critique), firstly because it was an inheritance from Cubism and Dada, and secondly, because, as the exhibition shows, its deployment by ‘pro-situs’ has made of it a commonplace, popularised in punk fanzines, and ‘Biff’postcards etc.",1
961,"The Situationists' activities within the cultural sphere constituted an attempt to create a unified range of activities which functioned as a radical critique of the conventional boundaries between specialisations embedded in the institutions, practices and agencies of modern life.",1
962,"The fragmented appearance of their work, especially its Lettrist phase, their repudiation of conventional skills and scholarly manners (evidenced in their use of personal insults) have been absorbed by subcultural milieux and in due course adapted by the culture industries.",1
963,The influence of the Situationists is clearly demonstrated (if overstated) in these books.,1
964,"If the historical trajectory of the Scrapbook is followed (SI through Fluxus, Heatwave, King Mob, Jamie Reid, Vivienne Westwood, and the Sex Pistols) the Situationist role for the intellectual as an informed but passionate critic gives way to philistine incitements to violence (typified by King Mob in Britain, the Motherfuckers in the USA, and also indirectly the punk phenomenon) but more commonly a laidback and philosophically weak critique of everyday life.",1
965,"The political and philosophical origins of Situationist thought to a large degree derives from Marx's critique of alienation and commodity fetishism, Lukács's development of this critique, and the Marxist-existentialism of Sartre and Henri Lefebvre.",1
966,The rejection of liberal democracy and bureaucratic Marxism led the Situationists dominant political organisations and towards libertarian and syndicalist influences.,1
967,The ideas of Anton Pannekoek which emerged with the publication of his after World War One provided a ready-made model of a non-hierarchical political system.,1
968,"The simple faith conveyed in Pannekoek's treatise recalls earlier utopian writing, and contrasts with the strident and acerbic tone of Situationist writing.",1
969,"With the exception of Wollen, the contributors to the Scrapbook and the Boston text convey little concern for the forms of political organisation espoused by the Situationists, and it is perhaps symptomatic of their interest in the SI as a purely aesthetic phenomenon.",1
970,"The SI clearly endeavoured to produce a revolutionary critique of modern life, and towards this end devised a convulsive rhetoric and an inventive vocabulary.",1
971,"The revival of interest in its ideas might be explained by this, by its standing as a political organisation.",1
972,The remoteness of the movement from working-class experience guaranteed the survival of its bohemian image.,1
973,Its re-emergence as spectacle relates more visibly to its cult status and the nostalgic allure of fifties Paris; a marginalised and dissolute existence in the company of exotic friends and of romantic places with beautiful names.,1
974,The Boston text reproduces old photographs of founding members.,1
975,"The gamine looks of Bernstein and the neatness of Debord have an aesthetic relevance which signifies a rather vague, but nevertheless compelling, reason for their inclusion in the text.",1
976,They are not merely documentation.,1
977,They are in fact significant elements in the story of ‘Situationism’ which is the subtext of the book.,1
978,The political reticence evident in these volumes is indicated by a degree of randomness in the choice of materials and by implication a commitment to the more ‘expressive’ or irrationalist side of their work.,1
979,"It is, , revealing that there is no indication in either book of the Situationist commitment to political struggles in the Third World and their critique of imperialism.",1
980,The introductions in both books are anodyne and brief.,1
981,"The historical significance of the SI is not questioned, and the importance of the movement is asserted largely on the basis of aesthetic innovations which derive from the Lettrist period the founding of the SI.",1
982,"and (drifting) are thus reclaimed their contemporary relevance, or rather for the extent to which they influenced punk and the camp and erudite artistic radicalism which exploited it.",1
983,"With the exception of Levin's extended analysis of film, neither the products nor any specific agitations of the Situationists and their epigones are critical reassessment.",1
984,The short commentaries and comic imagery in the British section of the Scrapbook are largely printed ephemera with unserious political pretensions.,1
985,"Some of it is amusing, some of it pretentious drivel.",1
986,"Clearly much of the material is unsupportable and there is a sense in which this is self-evident the Scrapbook is styled as an ‘anti-document’ which, like the films of Debord, is co-extensive with the equally unsupportable and qualitatively diminished world to which it relates.",1
987,"The temptation is to view these publications and the exhibition as a proliferation of surfaces which are in a sense pretty vacant reminders that despite the essentially teleological nature of the Situationist project, it is now immobilised and its documents merely a contribution to culture as the spectacular remains of an abandoned revolutionary ideal.",1
988,The  tendency is to ignore value distinctions and to undermine qualitative difference popular and high art genres are presented side by side in a unified space or text.,1
989,There is an inside knowledge which makes this ‘coherent’ for those it.,1
990,"This presupposes the same audience separations, the same hierarchies, the same educational and class difference as before.",1
991,Frank Mort has commented on this kind of separation between the new intellectuals who are happy and confident to mix genre and ignore qualitative and semantic difference ‘because they already know the map of Western culture’ and are distinct from those ‘who do not carry with them those levels of cultural capital.’,1
992,"He adds to this: ‘In that sense postmodern discourse with its relativism, its denial of grand narratives and its refusal of questions of value, is a world tailor-made for the new metropolitan intellectual cadres.'",1
993,It therefore seems that ‘in a purely negative way’ the silence over the question of meaning in the Boston text and in the Scrapbook is perhaps not surprising —— it is an historically appropriate response to the disappearance of the SI.,1
994,"‘There is a sorrow in the Zeitgeist’ bemoans Lyotard, an inappropriateness in the metaphor of the ‘avant-garde’, and consequently a kind of absurdity attaching to the belief in art as a prefiguration of a global collectivist future.",1
995,That sorrow hangs over the discontinued struggles of the SI.,1
996,The belligerence of their message and the violence of their appeal to negation and revolt is now passed over in silence and their works appear they were blank sheets to the privileged audiences of the present day.,1
997,II,1
998,"What I have argued so far is that the Situationists are ill-served by these publications, and that this is partly the influence of a certain pessimism which haunts contemporary cultural politics.",1
999,What I want to argue now is that there is a sense in which the symptom of this pessimism exist in the movement itself.,1
1000,"The Situationists were idealists in the sense that they perceived themselves the spectacle, always managing to be ‘other-than-spectacular’, as Levin puts it, this became a pre-condition of Situationist practice.",1
1001,"Their self-image was that of the chosen few for whom the spectacle provided an inexhaustible supply of objects (and people) to hate, and whilst the apparent ease with which they targeted and disposed of their opposition often made good copy (the endless adventure, the scandal, etc.), there is a sense in which the hectoring tone of their documents became repetitive and wearisome.",1
1002,The effusions of Vaneigem have an air of mystical revelation which is even more intense in recent publications.,1
1003,Debord's political fatigue is less evident but his filmwork has finished and he refuses to permit distribution and screening of his work in this medium.,1
1004,Bernstein is now a journalist and works for a French newspaper.,1
1005,"There are, I think, just three statements which count as unequivocally critical comments on SI in the Scrapbook.",1
1006,"They appear in the documents section and therefore do not, we may take it, represent the views of the editors.",1
1007,"Firstly, Art & Language's piece ‘Ralph the Situationist’ expresses considerable misgivings about the Situationist project: ‘The texts are effectively incorrigible and self insulating…’; ‘…bland incoherence — a self-contradictory absurdity — a moral ground to give up reading and remembering…’, .",1
1008,"Whatever gave Francis, or whoever it was, the idea that Art $ Language had anything to do with the Situationists?",1
1009,On what basis is this reference made?,1
1010,"There is no evidence of SI influence in their work, which has quite different intellectual roots, and the article itself leaves no doubt as to the extent of their disapprobation.",1
1011,"Furthermore, the inclusion of three early works by the group in the exhibition (dating from the late sixties) reveals a make believe idea about an A $ L/SI connection.",1
1012,There was no such connection.,1
1013,"As late as 1970 members of A $ L, to my knowledge, had never heard of Debord, and if they had were not the least bit interested.",1
1014,The arbitrary inclusion of artworks in the exhibition is further evidence of a curatorial effort to construct a narrative of ‘situationism’.,1
1015,"The case for Merz, Pistoletto and Buren may be different, but it is not unreasonable to expect a rationale for the proclaimed indebtedness of Arte Povera and Conceptual Art to the Situationists.",1
1016,Nowhere in these publications are these connections argued for: they are merely dogmatically asserted.,1
1017,"Given the withering contempt expressed by the Situationists for ‘prositus’, one shudders to think what Debord .",1
1018,are going to make of the ‘quasi-situationists’ discovered in America by Elisabeth Sussmann.,1
1019,"On the basis of her understanding, it appears that any artist in the USA who uses the conventions of the mass media in such a way as to produce a critique of the media (and I can think of a good many) is veritably a ‘quasi-situationist’.",1
1020,"The desire to create a pseudo-history of the movement's afterlife may be good for business, and may have provided extra material for the book (I refer to the Boston text, see pp. 10–13) but it is not the purer aims of the Situationists outlined elsewhere in these and other texts.",1
1021,The second critical comment I came across in the Scrapbook was George Steiner's statement from the in 1967.,1
1022,"Steiner accepted that the Situationists had identified and accurately described the emptiness of everyday life and even accepts their pleas for subversion, but was very sour about what he described as the ‘depressingly banal’ prescriptions of Debord and the ‘turgid creed’of Vaneigem.",1
1023,"Christopher Gray, one of the small number of English members of the SI, is the third commentator I found to be not entirely sympathetic.",1
1024,His comments come from an anthology of Situationist writings he edited in 1974.,1
1025,Gray's comments evoke a kind of mystical disenchantment with the movement  which he found to be too focused on an intellectual critique of society.,1
1026,"‘There was’, he complains, ‘no concern whatever with either emotions or the body.",1
1027,The SI thought you just had to show how the nightmare worked and everyone would wake up.,1
1028,Their quest was for the perfect formula.',1
1029,The history of the SI is in some ways a struggle for recognition (despite Debord's evasions) sustained by a radically negative critique which ultimately failed to find a middle way between Hegelian metaphysics and the dynamics of political organisation in the pursuit of its utopian objectives.,1
1030,The declamatory style of writing (which now seems dated) too often obscured the probity of the Situationist's critique of the alienating and manipulative effects of late capitalism and its creation of pseudo-needs.,1
1031,The movement's critique proclaimed a uniqueness and originality for its discoveries to which it was never entitled and which served only to reinforce the self-deluding image of its own power and influence in the world.,1
1032,Anti-authoritarian leftism and the critique of bureaucratic socialism had been well established before the foundation of the SI in 1957.,1
1033,The rejection of trade unionism was a common demand amongst anarchists and libertarian socialists.,1
1034,At the end of her life Rosa Luxembourg called for the abolishment of trade unions and promoted the view that workers' councils were essential organisations in the establishment of socialism.,1
1035,More generally the idea of the inseparability of cultural and political revolution has a long history within the libertarian tradition with its roots in revolutionary Romanticism.,1
1036,"The more direct inspiration for the Situationists was the Dada-Lettrist connection which provided the aesthetic and political basis for their adoption of non-cognitive methods of expression (automatism, chance and other depersonalising techniques of production) and also led to the definition of some key terms in their vocabulary.",1
1037,The critique of scientific socialism and economism has a major place in Marxist debate in the twentieth century.,1
1038,"The Situationists, contribution to this was negligible.",1
1039,"The Frankfurt School's Marxian approach to cultural criticism, and production and the social effects of technology and the culture industries pre-dates the writings of Debord, and yet, despite its relative lack of revolutionary fervour remains a far more wide-ranging and thoroughgoing critique of the field.",1
1040,"The conjunction of passion and knowledge, of libertarianism and planning, of feeling and thought are conventional oppositions in post-Enlightenment thought which have also bedevilled Marxism.",1
1041,The more orthodox theorists in this tradition have preserved this separation along the lines of a Romanticist/Utilitarian split.,1
1042,"Others have sought a reconciliation of the positions that these terms represent, and there is an abundance of literature which examines this relationship in advance of the Situationists.",1
1043,"If the Situationist project is flawed, as I believe it is, it is not because antecedent theories of libertarians, Marxists and Council Communists are ignored by them, but rather because they lacked the will to build on this tradition a systematic utopianism consisting of critique and plausible projections into the future.",1
1044,"Like the Surrealists before them, their transcendence of alienation remains abstractly utopian.",1
1045,"Despite revolutionary zeal, or perhaps it, they sought immediate compensations for the miseries of daily life, and spontaneous methods of attack which they mistook for political strategy.",1
1046,The Situationists' strategy consisted of an exploratory utopianism — a kind of heuristic projection of a future society.,1
1047,"Raymond Williams has remarked that the danger of the heuristic utopia is that it ‘can settle into isolated and sentimental desire, a means of living with alienation’.",1
1048,Another Surrealist inheritance which distances Situationists from the more radical utopians is their blanket condemnation of work.,1
1049,‘Never work!’ announced the Surrealists.,1
1050,It is an amusing quip (especially for those with private means) and makes joyful and nonsensical graffiti.,1
1051,But what does it mean?,1
1052,"Obviously it is an incitement to refusal, and an indictment of alienated labour.",1
1053,"The refusal is as understandable as it is naive, but seems to constitute at the same time what amounts to an abnegation of intellectual curiosity about human needs.",1
1054,Its political inflexion contests the middle-class work ethic which is the main purpose of its message.,1
1055,"The aristocracy, for its part, has never needed to be convinced of the importance of not working.",1
1056,"For other theorists William Morris, the concept of work is not considered negatively.",1
1057,Indeed; for Morris and other Marxists the nature of work necessarily changes in the process of social transformation.,1
1058,Marx defined labour as ‘human sensuous activity’.,1
1059,Lukács claimed that labour became the model for any social practice.,1
1060,The plea for an understanding of ‘totality’ in Situationist writing derives from Lukács and Marx whose critique of ‘separation’is directed exactly at the work/leisure distinction.,1
1061,"Asger Jorn's interest in folk cultures and tribal societies which lacked a notion of ‘art’ as a distinct intellectual practice separated from the common culture, was based on an understanding of the extent to which the spheres of art and work have become conflicting practices within bourgeois relations of production.",1
1062,Despite this the common tendency in SI writing on most forms of directed or purposeful activity (agitation or ‘destructive creativity') is negative.,1
1063,The aristocratic disdain for manual labour has its counterpart in the Situationist’ attitude to the working class considered as the moronised victims of the spectacle.,1
1064,In contrast the Situationists' notion of pleasure is a negation of work in almost every sense of the word — a kind of involuntary idleness in the land of Cockaigne.,1
1065,Their notion of pleasure is indistinguishable from a sixties Zeitgeist.,1
1066,"Its meaning is inadequately theorised and remains largely at the  level of common sense, a crude alternative to the repressive order of work.",1
1067,Situationist texts are widely available (and with these publications adding to the list) it is ironic that they seem less crucial than they once did.,1
1068,"Their appeal in the past was partly attributable to the popular texture of some aspects of the writing, its accessibility and its festive and irreverent politics.",1
1069,"These writings appealed essentially to a generation of students bored with academic life and attracted by the street credibility of the Situationists, and often provided students with the dubious pleasure of being flattered and insulted at the same time.",1
1070,The Situationist lifestyle (it could be imagined) had some influence on the hippy sub-culture in the late sixties and punk ideology in the seventies in Britain.,1
1071,"Situationist influence was more menacingly felt in France especially in the universities, although it has to be said that their influence upon the events of May 1968 has been exaggerated.",1
1072,", however, the legacy of the movement remained less obviously political, and restricted in its appeal to fairly specific audiences in the cultural milieu and especially the visual arts.",1
1073,"Indeed, the extent to which the Situationist influence has flourished in the spheres of art and popular culture is noteworthy and contrasts with the absence of the movement's influence in other domains.",1
1074,"The uneven profile of the Situationist group and its existential fragmentation together with the eclectic and impromptu formal character of the artefacts they produced, as I have suggested above, make it an ideal type for the postmodernist critic.",1
1075,"The Situationists' rejection of the classical model of left-wing monumentalism, and their apparent lack of commitment to the historical overview or the grand narrative is consistent with postmodernism.",1
1076,"Moreover, the freedom with which they juxtapose theory and humour, and plagiarise for artistic effect suggests strong affinity with the postmodern.",1
1077,The decline of the meta-narrative aphoristic models of philosophical expression (following Feuerbach and Nietzche) has been the favoured form of the Situationists.,1
1078,The fact that Baudrillard's name has been linked with the Situationists should not be held against them.,1
1079,"Nevertheless, the de-Marxisation of their project by him and the ‘death of the social’ which he has announced should alert us to the doubts raised by Raymond Williams on the issue of certain types of Utopianism.",1
1080,"The concept of the spectacle is an effective term which now has a wide currency, but perhaps only in a sense which approximates its use by the Situationists.",1
1081,"The historical period which has seen its political devaluation is one in which political optimism has become unfashionable, which perhaps is one way of explaining the retrospective or merely historicist character of the Situationist exhibition, and the books I have reviewed.",1
1082,"We have seen a shift from the utopianism of the 1960s to a culture of nostalgia and, as with the more dystopian elements in postmodernism, the exhibition and the books which accompany it look backward in a search for appearances they were compensatory fantasies substituting for a forgotten dream.",1
1,HOMICIDE,2
2,This chapter deals with the approach of the criminal law to behaviour which causes or risks causing death.,2
3,"Murder, manslaughter, and several other offences are discussed, and one recurrent issue here is whether English law responds proportionately to the different degrees of culpability manifested in cases where death is caused.",2
4,7.1 DEATH AND FINALITY,2
5,"For practical purposes, the culpable causing of another person's death may fairly be regarded as the most serious offence in the criminal calendar.",2
6,"There is an argument that treason is a more serious offence, since it strikes at the very foundations of the State and its social organizations, but treason is so rare that it is surely permissible to treat homicide as the most serious form of crime.",2
7,"The reason for this is not difficult to find: the harm caused by many other crimes is remediable to a degree, whereas the harm caused by homicide is absolutely irremediable.",2
8,"Even in crimes of violence which leave some permanent physical disfigurement or psychological effects, the victim retains his or her life and, therefore, the possibility of further pleasures and achievements, whereas death is final.",2
9,"This finality makes it proper to regard death as the most serious harm that may be inflicted on another, and to regard a person who chooses to inflict that harm as the most culpable of offenders, in the absence of some excuse or justification.",2
10,"Although many deaths arise from natural causes, and many others from illnesses and diseases, each year sees a large number of deaths caused by ‘accidents’, and also a number caused by acts or omissions which amount to some form of homicide in English law.",2
11,"For 1987 the statistics show that there were some 20,000 accidental deaths, of which some 7,000 occurred in the home, 6,000 at work, and 5,000 on the roads.",2
12,"By comparison, the number of deaths recorded as criminal homicide was 600, which includes all the  murders and manslaughters.",2
13,"This figure is relatively small when compared with many American cities, but that is no cause for satisfaction.",2
14,There are still awkward questions to be confronted.,2
15,", are we satisfied that the 600 deaths recorded as homicide are in fact more culpable than all, or even most, of the deaths recorded as accidents?",2
16,"In other words, does English criminal law pick out the most heinous forms of killing as murders and manslaughters, or are the boundaries frozen by tradition?",2
17,Another question is whether the criminal law ought not to be wider in its application to activities which carry some risk of causing death than in other spheres.,2
18,"Thus, it would be excessive to sweep large numbers of the deaths now recorded as ‘accidents’ into the law of homicide, there may be sufficient justification for creating or enforcing offences designed to ensure safe conditions of work, safe goods, safe buildings, .",2
19,It was argued in Chapter 2 that the criminal law ought to spread its net wider where the potential harm is greater.,2
20,"It will be seen that English law does this a point, and in the process seems to accept social-defence arguments as reasons for departing from several of the principles set out in Chapter 3.",2
21,7.2 REQUIREMENTS OF CRIMINAL HOMICIDE,2
22,"English law distinguishes between the offences of murder and manslaughter, as we shall see, but the two crimes do have certain common elements.",2
23,It must be proved that the defendant's act or omission caused the death of the victim within a year and a day.,2
24,(The requirements of causation in the criminal law are discussed elsewhere.),2
25,"The ‘year and a day’ rule is a legacy of times when medical science was so rudimentary that, if there was a substantial lapse of time between injury and death, it was unsafe to pronounce on whether the defendant's conduct or some other event caused the death.",2
26,"Nowadays the problem is quite the reverse: medical science is generally able to determine whether D's conduct caused the death, and innovations life-support machines mean that life can be prolonged for months and years in some instances.",2
27,"In one recent case the victim of a stabbing died two and a half years after  the incident, having been kept on a life-support machine for almost the entire time.",2
28,"In principle, it seems unjust that a homicide conviction should not be possible in such a case, if all the other elements can be established and only the ‘year and a day’ rule stands in the way.",2
29,"But the rule was confirmed by the Criminal Law Revision Committee in 1980, on the ground that a defendant should not be left in peril of a homicide conviction indefinitely.",2
30,Surely prosecutorial discretion should be enough to prevent unfair convictions years after the event.,2
31,The rule itself is accord with modern medical conditions and should be abolished.,2
32,DEFINING MURDER: THE INCLUSIONARY QUESTION,2
33,(a) The Procedural Context,2
34,"If causing death is to be regarded as the most serious harm that can be inflicted, it would seem to follow that the most blameworthy form of homicide should result in the highest sentences imposed by the courts.",2
35,"Indeed, many systems of criminal law impose a mandatory sentence for murder (or whatever the highest form of homicide is called in that system).",2
36,In some jurisdictions this is a mandatory sentence of death.,2
37,"In others, those in the United Kingdom, it is the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment.",2
38,"Why should this penalty be mandatory, and not at the discretion of the court as in other offences?",2
39,One argument the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment is that it amounts to a symbolic indication of the unique heinousness of murder.,2
40,"It places the offender under the State's control, , for the remainder of his or her life.",2
41,"This is often linked with a supposed denunciatory effect — the idea that the mandatory life sentence denounces murder as emphatically as possible — and with a supposed general deterrent effect, in declaring that there is no mitigation of sentence available for this crime.",2
42,It might also be argued that the mandatory life sentence makes a substantial contribution to public safety.,2
43,"None of these arguments is notably strong, conclusive.",2
44,"The mandatory penalty does indeed serve to mark out murder from other crimes, but whether the definition of murder is  sufficiently refined to capture the worst killings, and only the worst killings, remains to be discussed below.",2
45,"Whether the life sentence is regarded as a sufficient denunciation in society depends on the public's perception of what life imprisonment means: if it is widely believed that it results in an average of nine years' imprisonment, the effect will be somewhat blunted.",2
46,"The same applies to the general deterrent argument: its effectiveness depends on whether the penalty for murder affects the calculations of potential killers , and, if it does, whether life imprisonment is seen as significantly more or less severe than the alternative of a long, fixed-term sentence.",2
47,"public protection, this depends on executive decisions release; it fails to take into account whether it is necessary for public protection to keep ‘lifers’ in for so long.",2
48,"This brings the discussion to a crucial point: what does the sentence of life imprisonment mean in practice, and what would be the alternative?",2
49,"What it means is that the time of release from prison is determined by the Home Secretary, on the advice of the Parole Board and the Lord Chief Justice, by the judge at the trial.",2
50,"In procedural terms, therefore, the life sentence involves a transfer of function: normally it is the judge who determines the sentence (or its upper limit, since earlier release on parole may be possible), whereas a life sentence entrusts that function to the executive, who must first ascertain the opinions of the Lord Chief Justice and the trial judge.",2
51,"The Home Office is not bound by those opinions, and appears to depart from them frequently.",2
52,"In 1983 the Home Secretary imposed restrictions on the release of persons serving life for murders of police- and prison-officers, terrorist killings, murder during robbery, and the sadistic or sexual murder of young children, fixing a minimum of twenty years' imprisonment for these offenders.",2
53,"Whatever the justifications for introducing this policy, it serves to underline the fact that sentencing in murder cases is enacted without each case being considered individually, after hearing representations from the offender's counsel, and without a sentence announced in court and appeal.",2
54,", the executive takes decisions to release some murderers after only a few years and to keep others in prison for extremely long periods.",2
55,"Should those decisions not be taken by the courts, in  the same way as other sentencing decisions?",2
56,The answer sometimes given is that murderers should be treated differently because they are particularly dangerous: anyone who chooses to kill once can choose to kill again.,2
57,"But this argument will seem less persuasive when we have discussed cases of manslaughter diminished responsibility: where a murder is reduced to manslaughter, the judge has a wide sentencing discretion and may, the facts of the case, select a determinate prison sentence, a hospital order, or life imprisonment.",2
58,"Those who kill and are convicted of manslaughter diminished responsibility are no less dangerous than those convicted of murder, and yet the judge has sentencing discretion in one case and not in the other.",2
59,Considerations of this kind have led the House of Lords Select Committee on Murder and Life Imprisonment to recommend the abolition of the mandatory sentence for murder.,2
60,"In its place would be a sentencing discretion, which judges would use, in many cases, to mark the relative heinousness of the murder by a determinate prison sentence.",2
61,"In cases where life imprisonment was thought to be the appropriate sentence, the trial judge would still specify — in open court — the number of years to be spent in prison, taking the gravity of the offence into account, and release would be determined by a judicial tribunal.",2
62,Such a reform would bring improvements in natural justice without loss of public protection.,2
63,(b) Degrees of Homicide,2
64,"English criminal law has two degrees of homicide, murder and manslaughter.",2
65,"Many American jurisdictions have three degrees of murder — first-degree murder, requiring premeditation, and second- and third-degree murder, covering lesser shades of culpability.",2
66,"In England there has been a proposal that we should do away with all these distinctions, leaving a single offence of criminal homicide.",2
67,"That proposal, if implemented, would shift almost all the decision-making in homicide cases from the trial to the sentencing stage: the  only issue of any consequence in most cases would be the sentence to be imposed, and all the distinctions now drawn at the stage of criminal liability would be reflected in the sentence alone.",2
68,"The jury would have no role in most homicide cases, since a plea of guilty would be the norm.",2
69,"Contrast this with the position in jurisdictions where there are three or more degrees of homicide: pleas of guilty to first- and second-degree murders would be less frequent, since there would be the possibility of argument in court (if no bargain was struck beforehand between prosecution and defence), and the defence might succeed in persuading the jury to reduce the degree of the killing.",2
70,"Moreover, the borderlines between the various degrees would raise questions of law, which would provide much opportunity for legal argument and for appeals.",2
71,"The result would be that killings were classified and labelled in a more refined way, but at the cost of lengthy trials and mounting legal-aid bills.",2
72,That cost is not difficult to justify where capital punishment is the penalty for first-degree murder.,2
73,"Where there is no capital punishment, however, the question of how many degrees of homicide it is desirable to have calls for careful weighing of the principle of fair labelling (see Chapter 3.3 (l)) against the cost and time arguments mobilised by the policy of efficient administration (see Chapter 3.3 (m)).",2
74,The structure of the English law of homicide is rather strange.,2
75,"Although there are two offences, murder and manslaughter, the latter includes two distinct varieties: ‘voluntary’ manslaughter (killings which would be murder the existence of defined extenuating circumstances); and ‘involuntary’manslaughter (killings for which there is no need to prove any awareness of the risk of death being caused, but for which there is thought to be sufficient fault to justify criminal liability).",2
76,The arguments therefore tend to focus on three borderline questions: What is the minimum fault required for conviction of murder?,2
77,What conditions are needed to reduce murder to manslaughter?,2
78,And what is the minimum fault required for a conviction of manslaughter.,2
79,(c) Requirements for Murder,2
80,"In English criminal law there are now two alternative fault requirements for murder: an intent to kill, or an intent to cause grievous bodily harm.",2
81,What do these requirements mean?,2
82,"Do they extend the definition of murder too far, or are they too narrow.",2
83,"Intent to kill may be regarded as the most obvious and indisputable form of fault element for murder, but to some extent that depends  on the meaning of ‘intent’.",2
84,"This has been the subject of a number of House of Lords decisions, and yet the definition is still not clear and settled.",2
85,"Probably the most accurate statement would be that a person to kill if it is his or her purpose to kill by the act or omission charged, or if he or she foresees that death is practically certain to follow from that act or omission.",2
86,"In this way, both purpose and foresight of practical certainty are regarded as part of the definition of intent, although there are other statements suggesting that foresight of practical or ‘virtual’ certainty is merely evidence from which intent may be inferred.",2
87,How would this test be applied?,2
88,"In many cases the word ‘intent’ is used without elaboration, but there are some for which a full explanation of the meaning of intention is necessary.",2
89,"A fairly typical set of facts is provided by (1986), where D had a grudge against a woman and had threatened to ‘burn her out’.",2
90,"One night he went to her house, poured paraffin through the letter-box and the front door, and set it alight.",2
91,One of the woman's children died in the ensuing fire.,2
92,"When asked why he did it, D replied: ‘Just to wake her up and frighten her.’",2
93,"A defence of this kind, a claim that the purpose was only to frighten and not to cause harm, requires the full definition to be put to the jury.",2
94,"The question is: granted that D's purpose was to frighten, did he nonetheless realize that it was practically certain that his act would cause death or grievous bodily harm to someone?",2
95,The jury should answer this by drawing inferences from the evidence in the case and from the surrounding circumstances.,2
96,"What about the alternative element in the definition, an intent to cause grievous bodily harm?",2
97,"This has considerable practical importance, since this is all that the prosecution has to prove to obtain a verdict of guilty of murder.",2
98,"It must be shown that the defendant intended (which, again, includes both purpose and awareness of practical certainty) to cause really serious injury to someone.",2
99,"The House of Lords confirmed this rule in (1981): D struck his victim on the head a number of times with a chair, causing injuries from which the victim died a week later.",2
100,"D maintained throughout that he had not intended to kill, but there was evidence from which the jury could infer — and did infer — that he intended to cause grievous bodily harm.",2
101,"The House of Lords  upheld D's conviction for murder: an intent to cause really serious injury is sufficient for murder, without any proof that the defendant intended, or even contemplated, the possibility that death would result.",2
102,Does the ‘grievous bodily harm’ rule extend the definition of murder too far?,2
103,"If the point of distinguishing murder from manslaughter is to mark out the most heinous group of killings for the extra stigma of a murder conviction, it can be argued that the ‘grievous bodily harm’ rule draws the line too low.",2
104,"principle, the rule requires justification because it departs from the principle of correspondence (see Chapter 5.2(a)), namely that the fault element in a crime should relate to the consequences prohibited by that crime.",2
105,"By allowing an intent to cause grievous bodily harm to suffice for a murder conviction, the law is violating a general principle, turning the most serious of its offences into a constructive crime.",2
106,Why should it be necessary to ‘construct’ a murder conviction this lesser intent?,2
107,"There are arguments this: death is final, murder is the gravest crime, and there is no significant moral difference between someone who chooses to cause really serious injury and someone who sets out to kill.",2
108,"can predict whether a serious injury will result in death — that may depend on the victim's physique, on the speed of an ambulance, on the distance from the hospital, and on a range of other medical and individual matters.",2
109,"If one person chooses to cause serious injury to another, it should be presumed that he or she realizes that there is always a risk of death, and such cases show a sufficiently wanton disregard for life warrant the label ‘murder’ if death results.",2
110,"The counter-arguments, which would uphold the principle of correspondence, are that breach of that principle is unnecessary when the amplitude of the crime of manslaughter lies beneath murder, and also that the definition of grievous bodily harm includes a number of injuries which are most unlikely to put the victim's life at risk.",2
111,"In the leading case of Lord Edmund-Davies (dissenting) gave the example of breaking someone's arm: that is a really serious injury, but one which is unlikely to endanger the victim's life.",2
112,So in practice the ‘grievous bodily harm’ rule goes further than the arguments of its protagonists would support.,2
113,"Would it be right, then, to confine the fault element in murder to an intent to kill?",2
114,"That would have the merit of simplicity, but would  it strike the right note socially?",2
115,"There are powerful arguments saying that there are other killings where an intent to kill cannot be established, and yet where the moral or social culpability is equal to that in most intentional killings.",2
116,", one cannot be adamant about whether they merit the label ‘murder’, because that is a question of drawing the line between murder and manslaughter, which is not susceptible of any precise resolution.",2
117,It is hard to argue conclusively that the category of murder should be smaller or larger (unless the death penalty or a mandatory life sentence follows); it is a question of social judgment.,2
118,Let us briefly consider some of the possibilities.,2
119,The fault element for many serious offences is intent or recklessness: why should this not suffice for murder?,2
120,The question is whether all killings in which the defendant is aware of the risk of death are sufficiently serious to warrant the term ‘murder’.,2
121,"One answer sometimes given is that they are not, because a driver who overtakes on a bend, knowingly taking the risk that there is a car travelling in the opposite direction, should not be labelled a murderer if a collision and death happen to ensue.",2
122,This example assumes that a sympathy for motorists with overwhelm any tendency to logical analysis.,2
123,One might ask whether motorists are ever justified in knowingly taking risks with other people's lives.,2
124,"Yet if the example is modified , the overtaking is on a country road at night and the risk is known to be slight, it becomes questionable whether the causing of death in these circumstances should be labelled in the same way as intentional killings.",2
125,This is not to suggest that motorists should be treated differently.,2
126,"The point is rather that, knowingly taking risks with other people's lives is usually unjustifiable, taking a slight risk is less serious than intentionally causing death.",2
127,"In discussing the boundaries of murder, we are concerned with classification, not exculpation.",2
128,"To classify all reckless killings as murder might be too broad, but the point remains that some reckless killings may be thought no less heinous than intentional killings.",2
129,Can a satisfactory line be drawn here?,2
130,One approach would be to draw the line by reference to the degree of probability.,2
131,Murder is committed in those situations where D caused death by an act or omission which he knew had death as the probable or highly probable result.,2
132,A version of this test of foresight of high probability is used in several other European  countries; it was introduced into English law by the decision in ,2
133,"(1975), but abandoned in (1985) on grounds of uncertainty.",2
134,A second approach is to frame the law in such a way as to make it clear that the court should make a moral judgment on the gravity of the defendant's conduct.,2
135,Section 210.2 of the Model Penal Code includes within murder those reckless killings which manifest ‘extreme indifference to the value of human life’.,2
136,"Scots law treats as murder killings with ‘wicked recklessness’, a phrase which directs the court's attention to the circumstances of the killing.",2
137,"Both the Model Penal Code test and the Scots test may be reduced to circularity, however, for when one asks how extreme or how wicked the recklessness should be, the only possible answer is: ‘wicked or extreme enough to justify the stigma of a murder conviction’.",2
138,"Admittedly, the Model Penal Code does contain a list of circumstances which may amount to extreme indifference, which assists the courts and increases the predictability of verdicts in a way that Scots law does not, but the essence of both approaches is that there is no precise way of describing those non-intentional killings which are as heinous as intentional killings.",2
139,"Their protagonists argue that the law of murder is so important socially that derogation from the principle of maximum certainty should be allowed more accurate labelling by the courts; opponents argue that the principle of maximum certainty is needed here specifically to reduce the risk of verdicts based on discriminatory or irrelevant factors, distaste for the defendant's background, allegiance, or other activities.",2
140,"A third, more precise formulation derives from the recommendations of the Criminal Law Revision Committee in 1980, namely, that a killing should be classified as murder in those situations where there is an intention to cause serious injury coupled with awareness of the risk of death.",2
141,"Neither an intention to cause serious injury  nor recklessness death should be sufficient on its own, but together they restrict , producing a test which both satisfies the criterion of certainty and marks out some heinous but non-intended killings.",2
142,"A fourth approach, adopted by English law until 1957 and still in force in many American jurisdictions, is some form of felony-murder rule: anyone who kills during the course of a felony (or, more restrictively, a serious crime of violence) or whilst resisting arrest should be convicted of murder.",2
143,"Thus stated, there is no reference to the defendant's intention or awareness of the risks: the fact that D has chosen to commit rape, robbery, or another serious offence, and has caused death thereby, is held to constitute sufficient moral grounds for placing the killing in the highest category.",2
144,"Plainly, this is a form of constructive criminal liability: the murder conviction is constructed the ingredients of a lesser offence.",2
145,"Presumably the justification is that D has already crossed a high moral/social threshold in choosing to commit such a serious offence, and should therefore be held liable for whatever consequences ensue, however unforeseeable they may be.",2
146,"The objections would be reduced if awareness of the risk of death was also required: in other words, if the test were the commission of a serious offence of violence plus recklessness death.",2
147,"The effect of that test would be to pick out those reckless killings which occurred when D had already manifested substantial moral and legal culpability, and to classify them as murder.",2
148,"Four alternative approaches have been described, and many others could be listed.",2
149,"The point is that the traditional concepts of intention and recklessness do not, of themselves, appear to be sufficiently well focused to mark out those killings which are the most heinous.",2
150,The law must resort to some kind of moral and social evaluation of conduct if it is to identify and separate out the most heinous killings.,2
151,"Many people might think that a person who causes death whilst using an unlawfully held firearm or explosives ought to be convicted of murder because there is, generally speaking, no excuse for using such dangerous equipment.",2
152,"Some of the people thus covered would be armed robbers, others would be terrorists.",2
153,"The armed robber might say that he had no intention of using the firearm, that he carried it with him simply to frighten the victim, and  that it went off accidentally: if the jury believes that, should he be convicted of murder?",2
154,"The terrorist might say that he gave sufficient warning of the bomb for the area to be cleared, and that it was unforeseeable that a deaf person should remain on the premises and be killed in the explosion, which was intended only to cause damage.",2
155,"If the jury believes that, should he be convicted of murder?",2
156,It is possible that juries would prefer to convict of murder in such cases so as to register their abhorrence of the defendant's activities .,2
157,"If so, this would suggest a social preference for regarding killings of these kinds as among the worst the circumstances in which they occur, because of the defendant's awareness of the possible consequences.",2
158,"However, the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, which reviewed the matter thoroughly in the early 1950s, and later law-reform committees have accorded preference to the ‘general principle’ that ‘persons ought not to be punished for consequences of their acts which they did not intend or foresee’.",2
159,"A conviction for manslaughter would be sufficient to mark the gravity of those cases in which D was not aware of the risk of death, and the court would have ample discretion in sentencing to reflect the blameworthiness of D's conduct.",2
160,"However, there would have to be clear parameters of sentencing to avoid the intrusion of discriminatory or irrelevant factors at this stage.",2
161,To summarize: the existing English law classifies as murder those killings where there was an intent to kill or an intent to cause grievous bodily harm.,2
162,"The reason for distinguishing between murder and manslaughter must be to identify and to label the most heinous killings as murder, and it has been questioned whether English law succeeds in this.",2
163,"There are issues of general principle at stake, but it is also true to say that there can be no place in which to draw the line.",2
164,"The issue assumes special significance when conviction for murder carries a mandatory penalty, particularly when that penalty is death.",2
165,7.4 DEFINING MURDER: THE EXCLUSIONARY QUESTION,2
166,"Even in a legal system which had the narrowest of definitions of murder — say, premeditated intention to kill — there would still be an argument that some cases which fulfil that criterion should have their label reduced from murder to manslaughter extenuating circumstances.",2
167,"Just as the discussion of the aspect of the definition of murder travelled beyond the concepts of intent and recklessness, so the discussion of the aspect (i.e. which killings fulfilling the definition should be classified as manslaughter murder?) must consider the circumstances in which the killing took place and the culpability of the killer.",2
168,(a) The Mandatory Penalty,2
169,It is sometimes argued that the main reason for allowing such matters as provocation to reduce murder to manslaughter is to avoid the mandatory penalty for murder.,2
170,"Thus, if the mandatory penalty were abolished, it would be sufficient to take account of provocation when sentencing for murder.",2
171,This argument neglects the symbolic function of the labels applied by the law and by courts to criminal conduct.,2
172,"Surely it is possible that a jury might decline to convict of murder a person who intentionally killed under gross provocation, they knew that the judge could give a lenient sentence, because they wished to signify the reduction in the defendant's culpability by using the less stigmatic label of manslaughter.",2
173,Since there are two offences — and particularly in jurisdictions where there are three or more grades of homicide — surely it is right and proper to use the lesser offence to mark significant differences in culpability.,2
174,This may be seen as an application of the principle of fair labelling.,2
175,"The lesser verdict may also assist the judge in sentencing, and help the public to understand the sentence imposed.",2
176,"However, this reasoning is not accepted in English law for non-homicide offences, and provocation is not generally allowed to reduce a more serious offence to a less serious offence — probably for reasons associated with the policy of efficient administration (see Chapter 3.3(m)), which the significance of death is thought to outweigh in homicide cases.",2
177,(b) Manslaughter upon Provocation,2
178,"Provoked killings are generally thought to be less heinous than unprovoked killings, and provocation has long been accepted as a ground for reducing to manslaughter a killing which would otherwise fulfil the definition of murder.",2
179,"there are cases where the provocation is so gross and so strong that a court imposes a very short prison sentence or even a suspended sentence for the manslaughter — typically, cases where a wife, son, or daughter kills a persistently bullying husband or father — and such cases raise the more general question of whether provocation should ever be a complete defence to homicide or to other crimes.",2
180,That question was discussed in Chapter 6.5 above.,2
181,"The issue here is whether provocation should remain a qualified defence to murder, and, if so, how far it should extend.",2
182,"In English law the doctrine of provocation has two main elements, both of which are laid down in section 3 of the Homicide Act 1957.",2
183,"First, there must be evidence that D was provoked to lose self-control and kill.",2
184,"Second, the jury must decide whether the provocation was enough to make a reasonable man do as D did.",2
185,"D is not required to prove any of this: in a murder trial, if there is sufficient evidence that D was provoked to lose self-control, the judge is bound to leave provocation to the jury, and the burden of disproving it beyond reasonable doubt lies upon the prosecution.",2
186,(i).,2
187,The first requirement of the qualified defence of provocation is predominantly subjective — evidence that D was provoked to lose self-control and kill.,2
188,"This requirement contributes to the excusing element in the provocation doctrine, the idea being that a person who has lost self-control is less responsible for subsequent conduct.",2
189,"Without this element, there would be no way of excluding planned revenge killings, and the argument is that they should be excluded from the defence because a person who plans a response to an affront or a wrong ought to ensure that the response conforms with the law.",2
190,"The genuinely provoked killer, on the other hand, is in such a disturbed state of mind that such calculation does not occur.",2
191,How disturbed does this state of mind have to be?,2
192,The concept of loss of self-control has received little close attention from lawyers.,2
193,"Such phrases as ‘loss of temper’ or ‘heat of passion’are treated  as useful synonyms, for which angry or apparently uncontrolled reactions may be treated as evidence.",2
194,"One matter which is viewed as significant is a short space of time between the provocation and the killing, and there are some judicial statements which treat this as a matter of law: the loss of self-control must, it is sometimes held, be ‘sudden and temporary’.",2
195,"Thus in (1982) there had been considerable ill-treatment and violence by the deceased towards D and his girlfriend, and this led them eventually to plan and carry out a night-time raid on the deceased's flat, during which they attacked and killed him.",2
196,"The Court of Appeal confirmed that the defence of provocation was unavailable; D had lost his self-control at the time, it was hardly a sudden and temporary response to an act of the deceased, who was asleep when D struck him.",2
197,"Differing slightly from are the many cases where ‘cumulative provocation’ has been directed towards D over a period of time, and then some minor act sparks off the loss of self-control and killing.",2
198,"In cases of this kind (which rarely come before the Court of Appeal except on appeal against sentence), the last act of the provoker, minor in itself, may be placed in the context of the previous provocation, and may itself be treated as sufficient to show that the loss of self-control was ‘sudden and temporary’.",2
199,"However, there is no reference to a requirement of ‘suddenness’ in the Homicide Act 1957, and the courts have in effect restricted the defence to people with certain kinds of temperament.",2
200,"It is one thing to exclude cases like from the defence — the gap of some five days between provocation and killing savours of considered revenge; it is another thing to exclude defendants with slow-burning temperaments, who do not react to an insult or wrong, but go away and then react after hours of festering anger.",2
201,"Should a court be prevented from hearing and acting on evidence that, despite the lapse of a few hours, a defendant's temperament was such that it is fair to say that he or she was provoked to lose self-control, and that it was not calculated revenge?",2
202,"The Homicide Act requires evidence that D was to lose self-control: this is wide enough to include things said or done by persons the deceased, and acts done against persons D (e.g. where D is provoked to kill someone who has just committed a sexual offence upon D's son, daughter, wife, etc.).",2
203,But  the word ‘provoked’ does seem to require a human act a natural event which leads D to lose self-control.,2
204,"Thus, in (1986), the crying of a 17-day-old child was held to be sufficient to fall within the requirement (such an infant is not aware of the significance of what he or she is doing), whereas someone who loses self-control after a storm or explosion has destroyed his property would be outside the requirement.",2
205,These restrictions show that the subjective element is merely preparing the ground for the objective element; it is not part of a broader defence of emotional pressure of the kind discussed in Chapter 6.5(c) above.,2
206,(ii).,2
207,"Once the court is satisfied that there is evidence that D was provoked to lose self-control, it must go on to consider the second requirement: was the provocation enough to make a reasonable man do as D did?",2
208,This is English law's rather clumsy attempt to reflect the element of partial justification in the doctrine of provocation.,2
209,"The clumsiness is evident in the standard of ‘the reasonable man’, an anthropomorphic (and male) standard which might be taken to suggest a paragon of virtue if it were not for the context of partially exculpating a killing by such a person.",2
210,"The underlying point is that it is not every act of provocation which should be allowed to reduce murder to manslaughter, but only those serious enough to unbalance the behaviour of a person with reasonable self-control.",2
211,"In earlier times the judge would rule on the sufficiency of the provocation, and the result of this was rather narrow and legalistic categories of sufficiency (e.g. violence or finding a spouse in adultery were enough, but words or a confession of adultery were not).",2
212,"The Homicide Act 1957 deprived judges of their power to give authoritative rulings on the sufficiency of provocation, and the question must now be left to the jury, which should apply the test of the ‘reasonable man’ to everything said or done before the killing which might amount to provocation.",2
213,"There appears to be no time-limit on the matters to be considered, not only the final act but a whole course of conduct may be taken into account.",2
214,"If this is correct, it goes some way towards dealing with cases of ‘cumulative provocation’, and towards a broader defence of emotional pressure.",2
215,How has the ‘reasonable man’ test been interpreted by the courts?,2
216,In ,2
217,"(1954) D, who was sexually impotent, was taunted about his impotence and kicked in the groin by a prostitute with whom he had been attempting to have sexual intercourse, whereupon he lost self-control and killed her.",2
218,"The House of Lords held that the jury should consider the effect of these acts on a reasonable man, without regard to the sexual impotence.",2
219,"The court seemed to be afraid that if it allowed the jury to take account of one characteristic, sexual impotence, then it would be illogical to direct them not to take account of another characteristic, irascibility or bad temper.",2
220,"It is no less illogical, however, to ask a jury to consider the effect of taunts of impotence on a reasonable person who is impotent, and the approach was overruled by the House of Lords in ",2
221,(1978).,2
222,"A court should now consider the effect of the provocation on ‘a person having the power of self-control to be expected of an ordinary person of the sex and age of the accused, but in other respects sharing such of the accused's characteristics as they think would affect the gravity of the provocation to him’.",2
223,"This test demonstrates that the illogicality alleged in does not exist: some characteristics of each individual defendant must be considered by the jury in assessing the gravity of the provocation, but the level of self-control must be kept constant.",2
224,"Bad temper could not be taken into account, for that is plainly inconsistent with the standard of reasonable self-control.",2
225,"Mental imbalance should also be excluded, since that seems inconsistent with the idea of an ‘ordinary person’, and the defence should be one of diminished responsibility.",2
226,"Intoxication is plainly outside the test: if the provocation was not enough to lead an ordinary sober person to do as D did, then the essence of D's defence is intoxication provocation.",2
227,"The criteria adopted by the Court of Appeal in (1980) were that courts should only take account of characteristics with which the provocation was concerned; permanent characteristics race and, probably, religion may be taken into account, but transient conditions intoxication and exhaustion may not.",2
228,"The underlying idea is that citizens are expected to keep control over their behaviour, but that in circumstances where even a person of normal self-control might be provoked, the offence may be reduced from murder to manslaughter.",2
229,"The required standard of self-control is kept fairly constant, but to assess the strength of the provocation, it is necessary to consider the relevant personal  characteristics.",2
230,"This demonstrates the interaction between the excusing elements in provocation (not just the loss of self-control, but the degree of provocation experienced) and the justificatory elements (to an extent, D was right to react angrily to what had been said or done, unless the alleged provocation was self-induced or was a legally justified act).",2
231,"The interaction between these elements is a complex one, as we saw in Chapter 6.5.",2
232,"Thus, the standard of self-control is not constant but may vary, , with the age and sex of the defendant.",2
233,To modify the standard where D is very young (Camplin was 15) is understandable: it is not fair to expect a youth to show the same level of self-restraint as an adult.,2
234,The idea of having different standards for males and females has not been elaborated by the English courts.,2
235,"Clearly, sex may be a relevant characteristic in some cases, for some provocations are specific to one sex, but is there an argument for different standards of self-control for males and females?",2
236,Does the plight of battered wives who kill after a spate of ill-treatment warrant special treatment by the law?,2
237,(iii),2
238,At common law the famous case of ,2
239,(1942) held that the retaliation must bear a reasonable relationship to the provocation.,2
240,"The idea was that only an extremely grave provocation ought to mitigate a killing with a deadly weapon, whereas a lesser provocation might be allowed to mitigate other killings.",2
241,"This rule seemed to be modelled on the proportionality requirement in self-defence, and was criticized as quite unsuitable for cases of provocation, where loss of self-control intervenes between the provocation and the retaliation.",2
242,"Is it not both illogical and unreasonable to require a person who has lost self-control to ensure, , that his response is not disproportionate?",2
243,"This counter-argument has been given some recognition by the courts, the ‘reasonable relationship rule’ is a rule of law.",2
244,"But traces of it remain, since a jury must still be asked not merely whether the reasonable man would be provoked to lose self-control, but also ‘whether he would react to the provocation as the accused did’.",2
245,"The precise meaning of this formulation is unclear — does it mean ‘lose self-control and kill’, or  ‘lose self-control and kill in the way D did’— but it seems to derive from the notion that there are degrees of loss of self-control.",2
246,"If that is the underlying proposition, it is important to dissociate it from the unacceptable idea that a person's acts after loss of self-control should still be measured on an objective scale.",2
247,(iv).,2
248,"The two key questions here are: first, whether provocation ought to reduce murder to manslaughter; and, second, how wide the qualified defence should be.",2
249,"The answer to the first question is closely related to issues of stigma, labelling, and widely held opinions about culpability.",2
250,"It was argued above that it is unacceptable to claim that the mandatory penalty for murder supplies the for the qualified defence of provocation: the label ‘murder’ should be reserved for the most heinous of killings, and there is a widely held belief that provoked killings are not in this group.",2
251,"The second question, the proper ambit of the provocation defence, is more troublesome.",2
252,"It would be possible to absorb provocation into a wider notion of ‘extreme emotional disturbance’, as the American Model Penal Code does, the key to mitigation would be the extent of the defendant's psychological disturbance at the time of the killing the reasons for it.",2
253,One way of accomplishing this in English law would be to merge provocation into a widened doctrine of diminished responsibility.,2
254,"However, a central element in the common-law doctrine of provocation is the for the loss of self-control.",2
255,"If the explanation for the violent outburst lies in something which might understandably lead a person to be so angry as to lose self-control, then this supplies an added reason for mitigating the offence and the sentence.",2
256,"Thus the court must first ascertain the gravity of the provocation experienced by the defendant, and then consider whether this provides some excuse for the loss of control.",2
257,This does not gainsay the fundamental proposition that it is every citizen's duty to retain self-control — to the extent of not violating other people's interests — but it does open the way to a manslaughter verdict and to sentences which are rarely longer than eight years' imprisonment (less than half as long as the time served by many convicted of murder) and may be considerably shorter.,2
258,"However, the significant reduction in sentence is probably connected with the normative elements in the provocation doctrine, the elements of ‘partial justification’.",2
259,"In the existing law  this is shown by the requirement of reasonable self-control, and by the (probable) exclusion of conduct known to be legally justified from the category of sufficient provocation.",2
260,Surely it is the combination of the elements of partial excuse and partial justification (see Chapter 6.5 above) which raises sufficient exculpation to warrant a reduction to manslaughter.,2
261,(c) Duress as a Qualified Defence,2
262,In 1987 the House of Lords (in ) held that duress should not be available as a defence to murder.,2
263,"Their Lordships devoted little of their speeches to the possibility of allowing duress to function as a qualified defence to murder, reducing the crime to manslaughter and leaving the judge to pass an appropriate sentence.",2
264,"This would preserve the principle that a person who is threatened must be prepared to undergo heroic self-sacrifice take the life of a third party, just as the provocation doctrine preserves the principle that citizens ought always to retain self-control.",2
265,"However, the House of Lords preferred to see a conviction for murder in these cases, with the use of executive discretion to secure an early release from the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for offenders who killed when under duress, and thus appear to have reduced culpability.",2
266,"This is surely an unsatisfactory way of dealing with these cases, where the degree of emotional disturbance is likely to be no less than that involved in most provocation cases.",2
267,The normative requirements of the defence of duress (discussed in detail in Chapter 6.4) ensure that it is restricted to dire and realistic threats which a citizen of reasonable firmness could not be expected to resist.,2
268,The degree of emotional pressure on the defendant can almost be taken for granted in these cases.,2
269,"‘If murder is to be reserved for those homicides which are most deserving of stigma, this does not seem to be one of them.’",2
270,"If duress is not to be allowed as a complete defence to murder, the reduction in culpability should surely be reflected by reducing the conviction to manslaughter.",2
271,(d) Killings by the Use of Excessive Force on a Justified Occasion,2
272,"Just as it seems strange and unnecessary that the law should have to choose between duress as a complete defence to murder, and duress  as no defence , so it seems strange and unnecessary that a killing which narrowly fails to come within the requirements of self-defence or other justifiable force should then be classified as murder.",2
273,"The Australian case of (1957) involved a chicken farmer who, when he found an intruder stealing chickens, shot at him five times, killing him.",2
274,"The farmer's defence was that he intended only to wound the thief, and thought he was entitled to do so.",2
275,"In another Australian case,(1958), D was attacked by a man, in an isolated place, whom he believed was trying to force him to commit sodomy.",2
276,"D took a gun and, fearing that this stronger man would renew his attack, shot and killed him.",2
277,"In both these cases it was held that the alternative of a manslaughter verdict ought to be left to the jury where the occasion justifies action in self-defence, or to prevent a crime, or to apprehend an offender, but where the defendant acts beyond the necessity of that occasion.",2
278,Three reasons may be advanced for labelling these cases as manslaughter murder.,2
279,"First, cases of ‘excessive defence’ have a grounding in legal justification, the occasion was one which justified the use of some force, and this places them on a higher social plateau than killings with no element of justification .",2
280,"Second, the defendant has what one might term the ‘lawful motivation’, believing that the actions taken were right and proper.",2
281,"This is a subjective, motivational factor which corresponds to the objective moral distinction identified as the first reason.",2
282,"Third, in some cases the defendant acts instinctively an unexpected situation, completely misjudging the proper reactions in the heat of the moment: this is a similar reason to the second, but adds the element of emotional disturbance, which may explain the over-reaction in certain cases.",2
283,"Both the second and, more strongly, the third reason show that the doctrine of excessive defence may include a substantial element of excuse in its rationale, its theoretical foundation lies unmistakably in the concept of legal justification.",2
284,"The Australian initiative was rejected both by the Privy Council and the English courts, largely on the grounds that the common-law precedents were not compelling, that the full defence of self-defence should be applied indulgently those who use such force as they instinctively think necessary, and that the doctrine  of provocation might be used to accommodate other cases.",2
285,"The Criminal Law Revision Committee disagreed, recommending that a verdict of manslaughter should be possible where the use of some force was justified by the occasion and where D honestly believed that the force he used was reasonable in the circumstances.",2
286,"History then took a strange twist, for in ",2
287,(1987) the Australian High Court denounced the doctrine of excessive force as too complicated for juries and removed it from Australian law.,2
288,There is surely a strong social argument for regarding those who kill by using force on an occasion which justifies the use of force as less culpable than the ordinary run of murderers.,2
289,Whether this moral — social distinction should be reflected in the law by introducing a doctrine of manslaughter by excessive defence depends on the importance attached to the principle of fair labelling (see Chapter 3.3 ()).,2
290,"It is assumed here that juries and others do attach considerable importance to the label when it is a question of homicide, and therefore that the excessive use of force in self-defence is a matter which is properly reflected by a separate qualified defence, being left to sentencing (which means executive discretion, if the mandatory penalty for murder remains) or forced artificially into the doctrine of provocation (when there may be no real evidence of loss of self-control).",2
291,"The problem encountered in Australia, of the doctrine being too complicated for juries, was the result of a six-stage direction which the courts developed; surely the essence of the doctrine can be conveyed more simply than that, destroying it entirely.",2
292,(e) Manslaughter Diminished Responsibility,2
293,"Of the qualified defences to murder in English law, diminished responsibility is the most frequently used.",2
294,From 1977 to 1986 there were about half as many convictions for manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility as there were murder convictions.,2
295,"The phenomenon is a relatively recent one, since diminished responsibility was only introduced into English law in 1957, long-standing dissatisfaction with the insanity defence.",2
296,"Insanity was, and still is, a complete defence to crime, as we saw in Chapter 6.2 above, but its confines are narrow, and some persons  obviously suffering from mental disorder came to be sentenced to death for murder before 1957.",2
297,"Diminished responsibility has a wider ambit, but its effect is merely to reduce murder to manslaughter, giving the judge discretion on sentencing or other disposal.",2
298,"The wording with which section 2 of the Homicide Act 1957 introduced diminished responsibility is rather unsatisfactory, but judges, counsel, doctors, and juries have approached it with a compassionate pragmatism with the rarefied verbal analysis too frequently encountered in English criminal law.",2
299,"The mainstay of section 2 is a wide concept of ‘abnormality of mind’, interpreted in the leading case of (1960) as",2
300,a state of mind so different from that of ordinary human beings that the reasonable man would term it abnormal.,2
301,"It appears to us to be wide enough to cover the mind's activities in all its aspects, not only the perception of physical acts and matters and the ability to form a rational judgment whether an act is right or wrong, but also the ability to exercise will-power to control physical acts that rational judgment.",2
302,"Section 2 does require that the abnormality of mind should be one ‘arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury’, but this range of admissible causes is sufficiently general to encourage a broad construction of the defence.",2
303,"The court must, lastly, be satisfied that the mental abnormality ‘substantially impaired his [D's]mental responsibility’ for the killing.",2
304,"The formulation is strange, since it suggests that one can measure a person's ability to conform to the law.",2
305,"In practice, it has been taken as allowing the jury to assess whether the mental abnormality was such a significant factor in the killing as to reduce D's culpability to the extent that the offence should be reduced from murder to manslaughter.",2
306,"In most cases it is not the jury who takes this decision but the prosecution, who, with the judge's agreement, accepts the defendant's plea of guilty to manslaughter under section 2.",2
307,"Some 80 of diminished-responsibility defences are accepted by the prosecution, and only in around 13 of cases does the prosecution contest the defence evidence and thus require the jury to apply section 2.",2
308,What is the practical effect of a successful section 2 defence?,2
309,"In the three years from 1984 to 1986 there were some 229 such cases, of which almost half were dealt with by a hospital order under the  Mental Health Act 1983 (with or without restrictions).",2
310,"Ten received life imprisonment, 15 were given determinate prison sentences of between four and ten years, 10 were given prison sentences below four years, and 15 were given probation orders (with or without a condition of psychiatric treatment).",2
311,"These figures show the diversity of the cases dealt with under section 2, and they also represent a significant shift from policy in the 1960s, when around 70 of diminished-responsibility offenders were given hospital orders.",2
312,"The decline in hospital orders and the rise of prison sentences are traceable formally to the practice of modern psychiatrists of recommending fewer hospital orders, and in reality to the more restrictive policy on admission to special hospitals being pursued by the DHSS, and also to the higher proportion of defendants who are declared to have ‘recovered’ by the time of the trial.",2
313,"No hospital order will be made where the defendant is said to have recovered, and the courts often feel it necessary to impose a prison sentence in such cases.",2
314,"Delays before trial can therefore affect the result, for a defendant who is committed to hospital and recovers there would usually be released back into the community fairly swiftly.",2
315,Also receiving determinate prison sentences are those whose offence is reduced to manslaughter on a combined plea of provocation and diminished responsibility.,2
316,Among those receiving probation orders will be those for whom the section 2 defence is used to mitigate a mercy killing.,2
317,Should the qualified defence of diminished responsibility be retained?,2
318,"In answering this question, one has to contend with two muddles in English law, a general muddle about mental disorder and criminal responsibility, and a specific muddle about murder and manslaughter.",2
319,"The general muddle was discussed in Chapter 6.2(c) above: in principle, a person whose conduct was caused by mental disorder should not be liable to criminal conviction, but in practice the narrow and antiquated defence of insanity is rarely invoked in England (a handful of cases each year), and the courts normally proceed to conviction and then select a medical disposal where appropriate.",2
320,"The muddle could — and should — be cleared by introducing a workable mental-disorder defence, along the lines recommended by the Butler Committee in 1975.",2
321,If such a defence were  available in murder cases — and the consequence of a successful plea would be to give the court a limited discretion the order to be made — the case for a separate doctrine of diminished responsibility would be weak.,2
322,"The second muddle concerns murder and manslaughter specifically, namely, that since there is no workable defence of insanity, it is often assumed that the existence of the mandatory penalty for murder is the essential reason for the section 2 defence.",2
323,The Butler Committee argued that relatively minor mental disorders may be regarded as falling within section 2 simply because this outcome is thought to be preferable to mandatory life imprisonment.,2
324,"‘The medical profession is humane’, commented the Butler Committee, ‘and the evidence is often stretched.’",2
325,"That may be so, but it may be suggested that as much depends on the surrounding legal rules as on the mandatory penalty.",2
326,"If there is no workable defence of insanity, it is surely wrong to convict a grossly disordered killer of murder when the less stigmatic offence of manslaughter is at hand.",2
327,"And if the law of homicide makes no special provision for mercy killings (see Chapter 7.4(h) below) or for killings during extreme emotional disturbance, despite a widely held view that such cases ought to be treated as less culpable than ‘ordinary’ murders, is there not an argument for a fairly broadly defined qualified defence?",2
328,(f) Infanticide,2
329,"This is a separate offence from manslaughter, but it is relevant here its close links with diminished responsibility.",2
330,By the Infanticide Act 1922 Parliament mitigated the application of the law of murder to mothers who killed their new-born babies whilst suffering from the effects of childbirth.,2
331,"Doubts arose over the length of time which might elapse before the child ceased to be regarded as ‘newly born’, and the Infanticide Act 1938 extended the definition to the killing of a child within twelve months of its birth by a mother whose mind is disturbed either by reason of her not having fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to the child or the effect of lactation consequent upon the birth of the child.",2
332,"Infanticide is a defence to murder, but it is more usual to charge infanticide in the first place.",2
333,"The maximum penalty remains  life imprisonment, although almost all the cases each year (twenty or so) are dealt with non-custodially, usually by a probation order.",2
334,Three interconnected criticisms of the law may be considered here.,2
335,"first, the definition of infanticide is limited to the killing of the child most recently born, which means that when a mother in a disturbed state kills both her last-born child and another slightly older child, the one killing is infanticide and the other may be murder, whereas the defendant's culpability is surely the same in both cases.",2
336,"If the essence of infanticide lies in the effects of the stresses consequent upon recent childbirth, then it is this, and not the age of the victim, which should be the basis of the law.",2
337,"Second, the law is gender-specific, singling out women for more lenient treatment.",2
338,Some people take exception to this on the ground that it may imply that women generally have weaker characters and are less responsible for their behaviour.,2
339,"There is also the argument that the fathers of children may kill whilst overwhelmed by the stress consequent upon the arrival of a new child, and they should be not be left outside the law of infanticide.",2
340,"The third criticism is that the medical basis of the Infanticide Act 1938 is now discredited: the reference to the effect of lactation is without foundation, and it is acknowledged that the social pressures consequent upon the arrival of a new child (financial demands, unsuitable housing, effects on family relationships) may be just as likely to lead to the mental disturbance manifest in these cases as any condition linked specifically with the event of giving birth.",2
341,"In their evidence to the Criminal Law Revision Committee, the Royal College of Psychiatrists pressed for legal recognition of these wider social and situational factors.",2
342,"The Committee was equivocal on this, but recommended a formulation which would be broad enough to encompass these wider factors —‘the balance of the woman's mind was disturbed the effect of giving birth or circumstances consequent upon that birth’.",2
343,Would it not be preferable to absorb infanticide into the doctrine of diminished responsibility and allow the prosecution to charge manslaughter in such cases?,2
344,"This would have the advantage of removing both the restriction the victim and the limitation to  women, but the Criminal Law Revision Committee thought that this would lead to an effective narrowing of the scope of infanticide.",2
345,There might be cases of killings by mothers burdened by ‘social and emotional pressures’ which could not be brought within the definition of mental disorder which would be the basis of a reformed defence of diminished responsibility.,2
346,", doctors might be prepared to stretch those definitions to bring such cases within diminished responsibility, but that is an unsatisfactory basis on which to reform the law, and it provides the defendant with no legal protection against a murder verdict.",2
347,The Committee's solution was to persist with a separate offence of infanticide.,2
348,"Would it not be preferable to broaden the defence of diminished responsibility to convert it into a defence of extreme emotional disturbance, applicable to both sexes?",2
349,(g) Killing in Pursuance of a Suicide Pact,2
350,Section 4 of the Homicide Act 1957 provides that a person who kills another in pursuance of a suicide pact is guilty of manslaughter not murder.,2
351,"A suicide pact exists where two or more people, each having a settled intention of dying, reach an agreement which has as its object the death of both or all.",2
352,This may be said to amount to a mutual exercise of the individuals' rights of self-determination.,2
353,"Cases are infrequent, tending to occur in circumstances which evoke compassion condemnation.",2
354,"The Criminal Law Revision Committee recommended that killings in pursuance of a suicide pact should be a separate offence, on the ground that the stigma and maximum penalty for manslaughter are inappropriate in these cases.",2
355,"Suicide and attempted suicide ceased to be a crime when the Suicide Act 1961 became law, in recognition of the right to self-determination, but there remains an offence of aiding, abetting, counselling, or procuring the suicide of another which carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years' imprisonment.",2
356,"Many of the cases involve compassionate assistance, of the kind which may be necessary and justifiable if the right to self-determination is to have any meaning for those who are weak or bedridden (e.g. responding to a request to bring pills), but not all are like this.",2
357,"In (1977) a woman was convicted of an attempt to counsel her  mother's suicide by repeatedly encouraging her to take an overdose, and it was shown that the mother's death would greatly alleviate the defendant's financial problems.",2
358,"It is for cases of this kind, where the evidence shows that there was active persuasion compassionate assistance to someone already determined to commit suicide, that a substantial maximum penalty is thought necessary.",2
359,"For this offence and for the proposed suicide-pact offence, the Criminal Law Revision Committee (CLRC) recommended a maximum of seven years' imprisonment.",2
360,"This grading of the offences may be seen as a compromise between the compassionate elements in the offences, which are related to the right to self-determination, and the need to protect the vulnerable from persuasion on such a crucial matter as the ending of life, an argument also derived from the right to self-determination.",2
361,(h) Mercy Killing,2
362,This concept has no special significance in English criminal law.,2
363,"Where a clear case of mercy killing emerges in practice, the usual response is that ‘legal and medical consciences are stretched to bring about a verdict of manslaughter by diminished responsibility’.",2
364,"The Criminal Law Revision Committee regarded this bending of the law as unsatisfactory, and tentatively proposed a new offence of mercy killing where a person, compassion, unlawfully kills another who is, or is believed by him to be, permanently helpless or in great pain.",2
365,"The proposal attracted strong opposition, some arguing that it might withdraw legal protection from the weak and vulnerable, others arguing that the fundamental ethical problems could not be satisfactorily resolved by legal definition.",2
366,The difficulty with the counter-arguments is that the practice of ‘stretching’ diminished responsibility gives a defence to mercy killers already.,2
367,"Thus, in Dell's sample of diminished responsibility cases there were some ten cases with a mercy-killing element.",2
368,"Most of them involved ‘killings committed impulsively with whatever means were at hand’, usually by ‘men in their 60s or 70s [who]had reached breaking point under the continuing strain of looking after wives with severe mental or physical illness’.",2
369,"In some of these cases the  defendant appeared mentally normal when examined by the doctor, but the doctor was willing to infer from the circumstances that there had been abnormality of mind at the time of the killing, and to write a report which brought this within section 2.",2
370,"Practitioners seem to accept that worthy cases of mercy killing invariably have this outcome, but this informal approach provides the defendant with no legal basis for a defence — he or she is truly at the mercy of the psychiatrists, the prosecutor, and the judge.",2
371,"Thus, to return to the arguments mobilized against the CLRC's proposal: the chief difference in protection of the vulnerable between the present system and the CLRC's is that the latter had a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment, whereas life imprisonment is available where a defence of diminished responsibility succeeds; and the fundamental ethical problems are now swept under the carpet by a combination of a stretched diagnosis of ‘abnormality of mind’ and the ample judicial sentencing discretion, whereas the CLRC's proposal attempted to make the issues justiciable.",2
372,"If, however, the CLRC's proposal were altered to make mercy killing into a new qualified defence to murder, with the normal maximum sentence of life imprisonment, the central plank of the opposition to an explicit recognition of this mitigation in English law would disappear.",2
373,Beneath these arguments about legal form lie the wider issues of self-determination.,2
374,"English law might be said to recognize a right to self-determination, suicide is a crime, but that right does not yield a clear answer to the present difficulty.",2
375,The right to self-determination might realistically be extended to cover those who desire their own death but lack the resources or the strength to accomplish it: this is a strong argument for a mercy-killing defence or offence.,2
376,"Yet, recognition of that extension might at the same time open up the possibility that vulnerable people who do not desire death, despite their suffering, might be killed by others for reasons of their own: this would subvert the right to self-determination, and is an argument against a mercy-killing defence or offence.",2
377,"It seems probable that some doctors carry out mercy killings by administering large doses of pain-killing drugs which shorten life significantly, and the law may well protect them from  liability.",2
378,"However, such trust is not shown towards relatives and friends who assist suffering people in this way: they must run the gauntlet of a legal process which accords no formal recognition to the circumstances under which they killed.",2
379,(i) Conclusion: the Murder-Manslaughter Boundary,2
380,"The basic legal distinction between murder and manslaughter lies in the mental element, but English law has now developed qualified defences to murder which mark out cases where, despite the presence of the mental element for murder, culpability is thought to be sufficiently reduced to warrant a reduction in the class of offence.",2
381,"Our discussion has taken a broad view of qualified defences, commenting also on some qualified defences which might be recognized but which do not feature in contemporary English law.",2
382,Various reasons have been advanced for recognizing qualified defences to murder.,2
383,"Some regard the mandatory penalty for murder as the chief, even the sole, reason for these doctrines.",2
384,It has been suggested here that the mandatory penalty is relevant but not critical.,2
385,"The key issues are, on the one hand, the proper legal classification of an offence which contains some exculpatory features, and, on the other, the distribution of decision-making power between the judge, the jury, and the executive.",2
386,"The label ‘murder’, and the stigma thought to accompany it, should be reserved for the most heinous group of killings; there is a well-recognized offence of manslaughter beneath murder, and this should be used for offences where the culpability is significantly lower.",2
387,"The mandatory penalty of life imprisonment for murder makes issues of relative culpability non-justiciable , since the length of imprisonment is ‘determined or partly determined behind the scenes by someone who has not heard any representations by or the prisoner on grounds which the prisoner does not know’.",2
388,"If, on the other hand, Lord Kilbrandon's suggestion of a single offence of unlawful homicide were adopted, the crucial questions of culpability would be decided solely at the sentencing stage by the judge.",2
389,The jury would have no role in this; the judge would derive no assistance from their verdict.,2
390,"What, then, should be the proper division of functions between judge and jury in homicide cases?",2
391,The arguments some  seven qualified defences have been considered above.,2
392,"Since it is possible that one defence might be raised in each case, sometimes in combination with a defence of lack of intent, a system of criminal law which offers seven qualified defences to murder risks undue complication and confusion in contested cases.",2
393,"The merit of separate qualified defences is that they focus the evidence and the legal argument, giving the jury (in contested cases) an opportunity to assess the defence, and giving the judge fairly precise guidance on the basis for sentencing: this might be thought to ensure that each defendant is dealt with more fairly, but the risk of confusing the jury in a contested case might tend to erode that protection.",2
394,One approach would be to consider amalgamating some of the defences.,2
395,"This is not to condone ‘stretching’ defences, using diminished responsibility to cover mercy killing, , or provocation to cover excessive defence, but rather to examine whether the defences have common rationales which can be drawn together.",2
396,"Three of the qualified defences discussed above have an element of justification — provocation, excessive defence, and some cases of duress.",2
397,"Most of the qualified defences have an element of excuse — provocation, diminished responsibility, most duress cases, infanticide, mercy killing, and suicide pacts.",2
398,"One possibility would be to evolve a qualified defence of killing under extreme emotional disturbance, following the lead of the Model Penal Code.",2
399,This might encompass all those qualified defences with an element of excuse in them.,2
400,"A provoked loss of self-control could fall within this new doctrine — as, indeed, could losses of self-control stemming from non-human sources a natural disaster or financial ruin.",2
401,"Diminished responsibility could also be accommodated, although a general defence of mental disorder remains a better way of labelling and dealing with cases of clinical mental disorder.",2
402,"Cases now treated as infanticide often involve extreme emotional disturbance, as do mercy killings, suicide pacts, and cases of duress.",2
403,"One advantage of this amalgamation might be that there would be less potential for the jury to become confused, and yet the jury would still be empowered to reduce murder to manslaughter in appropriate cases.",2
404,"One disadvantage of the change might be that the more precise moral distinctions currently incorporated within the law would become submerged within the sentencing discretion, where the signposts are less clear and the arguments less structured.",2
405,"This might be the case with provocation, : there may be objections to some of the distinctions now drawn by the law of  provocation, but a broader defence of extreme emotional disturbance might provide for reduction of the offence in cases of loss of self-control when caring for a baby or when arrested by a police-officer known to be acting lawfully, and some might feel that there are strong arguments against this.",2
406,"However, such disadvantages could be minimized by elaborating the definition of extreme emotional disturbance to clarify its extent and its limitations, and by evolving sentencing guidelines which set out the major determinants of culpability.",2
407,This would attribute some weight to the principle of maximum certainty (see Chapter 3.3(i)) in this important area of the law.,2
408,"Yet there would undoubtedly remain a considerable amount of discretion, both for judges and juries applying the law, if the words ‘sufficient to reduce the offence from murder to manslaughter’ were retained, and at the sentencing stage, the particular combination of factors in each case.",2
409,"Such a reformulated qualified defence would not encompass cases of excessive self-defence, since they may involve a genuine and unhurried misjudgment of the amount of force permissible, and so they would have to be the subject of a separate qualified defence.",2
410,"But the question remains whether, in practice and in theory, it would not be fairer to retain several separate qualified defences which labelled the circumstances of each mitigated killing more accurately.",2
411,7.5 ‘INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER’,2
412,"The category of killings which has come to be known as involuntary manslaughter has nothing to do with involuntariness, properly .",2
413,These are not cases where the accused has caused death while in an involuntary state.,2
414,"These are cases where death has been caused with insufficient fault to justify labelling it as murder, but with sufficient fault for a manslaughter verdict.",2
415,"The word ‘involuntary’ is therefore used merely to distinguish these killings from ones which have the necessary intent for murder but which are reduced to manslaughter by one of the doctrines just considered, provocation or diminished responsibility.",2
416,The legal debate in involuntary manslaughter is over the lower threshold of homicide liability — where to draw the line between manslaughter and killings which should be ascribed to mere accident.,2
417,"There is, however, a large variety of killings which lie above that line but  below the line demarcating murder: a killing in which D knew there was a risk of death, but was held not to have intended death or grievous bodily harm, would fall within involuntary manslaughter and might justify a high sentence; whereas a killing in which D pushed a person during an argument in the street and the person fell backwards, cracking his head on the kerb and dying from a brain haemorrhage, might also fall within involuntary manslaughter and might justify a low sentence.",2
418,"The offence, as now defined in English law, covers a wide spectrum of culpability.",2
419,Beneath the law of involuntary manslaughter lie some deep issues of general principle.,2
420,", the offence includes a species of constructive liability, which was criticized in Chapter 5.2(b).",2
421,"Can this be justified by reference to the magnitude of the harm resulting, i.e. death?",2
422,"Or would it be fairer to convict the harm-doer of a lesser offence, thus ignoring the chance result?",2
423,"Another problem is the more general one of liability for negligence: as we saw in Chapter 5.3 (), this is regarded as insufficient for liability for most serious offences, and yet it may be sufficient for manslaughter.",2
424,"Is it right that liability for the second most heinous crime in English law, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, should be satisfied by this relatively low grade of fault?",2
425,These questions will be discussed in more detail once the elements of the offence have been outlined.,2
426,(a) Manslaughter by an Unlawful and Dangerous Act,2
427,This species of involuntary manslaughter is based upon constructive liability.,2
428,"In broad terms, the law constructs liability the lesser crime which D was committing, and which happened to cause death.",2
429,"In fact, the courts have progressively narrowed this species of manslaughter over the last century or so: there was a time when the mere commission of a tort or civil wrong sufficed as the ‘unlawful act’, and when there was no additional requirement of ‘dangerousness’ to be satisfied.",2
430,"What the prosecution must now prove is that D was committing a crime (not being a crime of negligence or a crime of omission), that in committing this crime he caused V's death, and that what he did when committing this crime was objectively dangerous.",2
431,Let us examine each of these requirements in turn.,2
432,"First, D must have been committing a crime.",2
433,"In many cases the crime which constitutes the ‘unlawful act’ will be a battery or an  assault occasioning actual bodily harm, arising from a push, a punch, or a kick.",2
434,"The prosecution must establish that all the elements of the crime relied upon as the unlawful act were present, and this includes the mental elements of intent or recklessness in assault or battery.",2
435,"To that extent there may be said to be a mental element required for this variety of manslaughter, but it is a manifestly low mental element compared with the death which results.",2
436,"If the unlawful act is arson (criminal damage by fire), the fault element will be intention or recklessness, and the latter does not require any subjective awareness on the defendant's part.",2
437,"Where D was intoxicated when committing the ‘unlawful act’, it is likely that he would be liable to conviction for that offence despite his intoxicated state.",2
438,"If so, the offence is sufficient to fulfil the ‘unlawful act’ requirement for manslaughter.",2
439,There are two types of crime which will not suffice as the unlawful act: crimes of negligence and crimes of omission.,2
440,The reasons for excluding crimes of omission are examined in section 7.5(d) below.,2
441,The reasons for excluding crimes of negligence were stated in.,2
442,The reasons for excluding crimes of negligence were stated in.,2
443,"(1937), where a driver had killed a pedestrian whilst overtaking another car.",2
444,"There was little dispute that D had committed the offence of dangerous driving, but did that automatically make him guilty of manslaughter when death resulted?",2
445,"The House of Lords held that it did not: since the essence of dangerous driving was negligence, a driver should only be convicted of manslaughter if his driving was so bad as to amount to the gross negligence required under the third head of involuntary manslaughter (see below).",2
446,"the decision was motivated by tenderness towards motorists is hard to tell, but there was certainly some logic in keeping offences of negligence the ‘unlawful act’ doctrine when a separate head of manslaughter by gross negligence already existed.",2
447,"Once it has been established that D was committing a criminal offence, the second step is to establish that this caused the death.",2
448,"In most cases of battery or actual bodily harm the causal connection will be plain, but cases involving drugs have presented difficulties.",2
449,"In (1976) the Court of Appeal was prepared to hold that the offence of possessing controlled drugs was sufficient, together with the act of injecting another with these drugs, it is difficult to see how mere possession (which is the offence) can cause  death.",2
450,"In (1982) the unlawful act was the supplying of controlled drugs to V, who then took them.",2
451,"The Court of Appeal held that the supplying was insufficient as an unlawful act because it was not ‘directed at’ V. Subsequent decisions are unclear whether the ‘directed at’test remains good law, and a better approach to the facts of would be to hold that the supplying of drugs did not cause the death because V took them himself.",2
452,The third requirement is that the defendant's conduct in committing the crime must have been objectively dangerous.,2
453,"This was seen as a slight restriction of the doctrine when it was imposed in (1966), where the court held that ‘The unlawful act must be all sober and reasonable people would inevitably recognize must subject the other person to, , the risk of some harm resulting therefrom, albeit not serious harm.’",2
454,"The House of Lords has declined to narrow this requirement by demanding that D recognized the risk, and it has also been held that the dangerousness should be judged on the actual circumstances, ignoring D's mistaken belief about the facts.",2
455,"The test therefore appears to be broad and readily fulfilled, but the phrase ‘some harm…albeit not serious harm’ has been construed restrictively in one sense.",2
456,"In (1985) D, wearing a mask and carrying a pickaxe handle, approached a petrol-station attendant and demanded money; D fled when the attendant pressed the alarm bell, but the attendant then suffered a heart attack and died.",2
457,"The Court of Appeal held that the unlawful act would only be regarded as ‘dangerous’ if it was likely to cause physical harm, not if mere emotional shock (unaccompanied by physical harm) was foreseeable.",2
458,(b) Manslaughter by Recklessness,2
459,The most recent development in the law of involuntary manslaughter is the doctrine of manslaughter by recklessness.,2
460,"Although the word ‘reckless’ had been used many times before in the context of manslaughter, a distinctive doctrine was established in (1983).",2
461,"4 After an argument with the woman with whom he had been living, D drove his lorry into her car and crushed her to death.",2
462,"The House of Lords held that this was manslaughter if there was an obvious and serious risk of causing physical injury to some other person, and D had either failed to give any thought to this risk or, having recognised the risk, nonetheless went on to take it.",2
463,"It will be seen that this is the formula for recklessness (analysed in Chapter 5.3 ()), and is virtually the same as the test for the separate offence of causing death by reckless driving.",2
464,"The House of Lords accepted that the definitions of the two offences are the same, merely adding that the prosecutor should charge manslaughter when the maximum penalty for the offence of causing death by reckless driving (five years) might be insufficient.",2
465,"In the House of Lords seemed to be principally concerned with manslaughter committed with a motor vehicle, but subsequent cases establish that the test of ‘obvious and serious risk of physical injury to some person’ is applicable to offences using different methods, fire.",2
466,(c) Manslaughter by Gross Negligence,2
467,"Although the authorities conflict, it has been laid down that the new doctrine of reckless manslaughter supersedes the older doctrine of manslaughter by gross negligence.",2
468,"Many of the old cases could indeed be subsumed within the new doctrine, but it does not cover them all.",2
469,"In the case of (1974), where an attendant at a mental hospital caused the death of a patient by releasing a flow of boiling water into a bath, the test was whether he was grossly negligent.",2
470,"In (1925), where a doctor had attended the confinement of a woman who died whilst giving birth, the Court of Criminal Appeal held that there must be negligence over and above that which is sufficient to establish civil liability, and which shows ‘such disregard for the life and safety of others’ deserve punishment.",2
471,"Both these cases might be decided similarly on the test, but that cannot be said of (1967).",2
472,"Here two young men were joking with a gun; D pointed it at V and pulled the trigger, believing that it would not fire because neither bullet was opposite the barrel.",2
473,"The gun was a revolver, however, and it did  fire, killing V. The Court of Appeal held that D might properly be convicted if his belief that there was no danger of the gun firing was formed in a criminally negligent way.",2
474,"However, under the test derived from , a person is not reckless if he thinks about the possible risk but decides that it does not obtain.",2
475,"This is the gap, and is a case which might have fallen into it.",2
476,"It therefore follows that, if the courts have indeed replaced manslaughter by gross negligence with manslaughter by recklessness, they have narrowed the law slightly.",2
477,"It is more likely, however, that manslaughter by gross negligence remains reckless manslaughter.",2
478,(c) Manslaughter by Omission,2
479,"The courts have been reluctant to bring omissions cases within the above categories, manifesting their belief in the separate moral and legal status of omissions.",2
480,"This was not always so: in (1899) a man who belonged to a religious sect called the Peculiar People refused to call a doctor to his child, who subsequently died; he was held guilty of manslaughter on the ground that he had committed an unlawful act (wilful neglect of the child) which caused death.",2
481,"However, this very reasoning was abjured in (1973), where D failed to ensure that medical help was summoned to his child, and it died.",2
482,The Court of Appeal held that a manslaughter verdict would not necessarily follow from a conviction for wilful neglect:,2
483,if I strike a child in a manner likely to cause harm it is right that if the child dies I may be charged with manslaughter.,2
484,"If, however, I omit to do something with the result that it suffers injury to health which results in death, we think that a charge of manslaughter should not be an inevitable consequence, the omission is deliberate.",2
485,"This passage suggests that the law should, and does, draw a distinction between the blameworthiness of acts and omissions, even where the omission is deliberate.",2
486,And yet the connection between withholding medical aid and subsequent death is surely closer than that between striking a child once and subsequent death.,2
487,The father's duty in and in is manifest and incontrovertible.,2
488,"If the ‘unlawful act’ doctrine is thought sound, these cases should fall squarely within it.",2
489,"If the doctrine is thought unsound, both the omissions  cases and the act cases should be taken it.",2
490,A distinction between them is morally untenable.,2
491,Omissions cases falling within manslaughter by recklessness or gross negligence have also been set cases of positive acts.,2
492,"The leading modern case is (1977), where two people were convicted of manslaughter for allowing a sick relative, whom they had permitted to live in their house, to die without medical attention.",2
493,The Court of Appeal's grounds for finding a duty of care in this case are scrutinized elsewhere.,2
494,"Once the duty is established, the fault element required was expressed as recklessness, and defined thus: ‘a reckless disregard of danger to the health and welfare of the infirm person.",2
495,Mere inadvertence is not enough.,2
496,"The defendant must be proved to have been indifferent to an obvious risk of injury to health, or actually to have foreseen the risk but to have determined nevertheless to run it.’",2
497,"This passage is rendered ambiguous by the use of the word ‘indifferent’: if that connotes failure to realize an obvious risk, the test is similar to but probably inconsistent with the earlier assertion that ‘mere inadvertence is not enough’.",2
498,"If the test of recklessness does indeed apply, then this form of omissions liability could be assimilated within the general doctrine of manslaughter by recklessness.",2
499,"The only difference would be that required an obvious risk of physical injury to another, whereas required a risk of injury to health, and the difference may be more apparent than real.",2
500,(e) The Contours of Manslaughter,2
501,The English law of manslaughter exhibits a tension between various principles of fairness to the defendant and the significance of the harm caused.,2
502,"It is the resulting harm (death) which still dominates, as is evident from the fact that many forms of conduct fall within the law of manslaughter if death happens to result, whereas they would not even amount to a serious offence if a consequence less than death had ensued.",2
503,"Thus ‘unlawful act’ manslaughter, which can be committed by virtue of a mere assault or battery, is an example of constructive liability (see Chapter 5.2 (a) and (b)); it is only luck which makes the difference between the summary offence of common assault (maximum, six months' imprisonment) and the grave  offence of manslaughter (maximum, life imprisonment).",2
504,"‘Reckless’ manslaughter is also an example of constructive liability; recklessness is justifiable as a standard, it is only an obvious risk of injury which must have been foreseeable.",2
505,Can these derogations from principle be justified?,2
506,"Reasons can only be found in the unique significance of human life and in the need to mark out, and to prevent, conduct which causes its loss.",2
507,"In considering whether these reasons are strong enough, we should not neglect the fact that some offences of manslaughter lie well above the lower boundaries of liability and fall little short of murder.",2
508,"There is no doubting the substantial culpability of the person who embarks on a course of conduct knowing that there is a risk of death to another (e.g. the man who administered chloroform in ), and the person who foresees the risk of really serious harm to another from the course of conduct being pursued.",2
509,"The offence of murder is restricted to intent, and it would seem natural that recklessness the same consequences should amount to the lesser offence of manslaughter.",2
510,"The Criminal Law Revision Committee, which found much of the English law of manslaughter unsupportable, argued that there is a need for a homicide offence beneath murder to encompass those who cause death when reckless death or serious injury.",2
511,"But what about the lower threshold of manslaughter, where its minimum requirements form the boundary with accidental (non-criminal) homicide?",2
512,"Surely, to apply the label ‘manslaughter’ to the conduct of a person who envisaged no more than a common assault, e. g. by a single punch, is both disproportionate and unfair.",2
513,It grossly exaggerates the amount of subjective culpability.,2
514,"And, viewed objectively, the risk of death from a single punch is far too remote to enter into one's reasonable contemplation.",2
515,The present law attributes too much weight to chance: ‘the offender's fault falls too far short of the unlucky result.,2
516,So serious an offence as manslaughter should not be a lottery.’,2
517,To support manslaughter liability in these cases one would have to espouse the draconian principle that a person should be held liable for all the consequences of any wrongful act.,2
518,"A refusal to espouse that principle is perhaps the only ground on which the omissions cases (see 7.5(d) above) can be defended, since their  distinction between acts and omissions is unconvincing.",2
519,"Different considerations press forward, however, when we move on to the various situations in which known risks ought to be guarded against: bad driving of a motor vehicle may carry an obvious risk of causing death or serious injury, as may bad navigation of a ship or an aircraft, bad driving of a train, setting fire to a residential building, and the handling of firearms.",2
520,"These risks are widely known, distinguished as much by the possibility of one or several deaths occurring as by the frequency with which the risk materializes.",2
521,"Those who deal with firearms are generally aware of the attendant risks, and the days when those involved in motoring and other forms of transport could make light of the risks to life have now long passed, as various air, sea, rail, and road disasters have occurred.",2
522,"In spheres of conduct these, where the risks are widely known, there are strong reasons for broadening the basis of criminal liability to encompass negligence.",2
523,"This still falls well short of supporting the English law of manslaughter, where the ‘unlawful act’ doctrine allows a manslaughter conviction if death results from a mere assault or battery.",2
524,It also fails to substantiate the claim that death-causing acts or omissions in these situations of known danger should fall within the law of manslaughter some other offence.,2
525,Thus it remains for discussion whether it would not be preferable to criminalize them special ‘endangerment’ offences.,2
526,"One advantage of that approach would be to direct attention to the particular source of danger, thus labelling the offence in a way which both describes the circumstances of the offence and serves an educative or even deterrent purpose.",2
527,"A possible disadvantage is that, since such offences may lack the stigma of the word ‘manslaughter’, they may tend to underplay the gravity of the behaviour involved.",2
528,"On the other hand, the social significance of the offences is likely to be set as much by prosecution policy and sentencing policy as by the label of the offence.",2
529,"These tensions behind the law of manslaughter are evident in the decisions of the courts during this century, many of which have narrowed the offence, but some of which have extended it.",2
530,"However, only the legislature can create new offences of endangerment.",2
531,What progress has it made towards this?,2
532,7.6 ENDANGERMENT ON THE ROADS,2
533,English law contains a number of offences which penalize the driving of a car on a road in a manner which may cause harm.,2
534,"There is the offence of driving recklessly (section 2 of the Road Traffic Act 1972), and there are also the lesser offences of driving without due care and attention, and driving without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road (section 3 of the 1972 Act).",2
535,"Clearly, the difference between reckless driving and careless driving is one of degree.",2
536,"In the leading case of (1981) it was held that reckless driving consists of driving which creates an obvious and serious risk of causing physical injury to some other person who might be happening to use the road or of doing substantial damage to property, and that the fault element is that the driver either failed to give any thought to the possibility of such a risk or, having recognized the existence of a risk, went on to take it.",2
537,"Many of the cases falling within this offence may involve serious fault — where there is racing on the highway, , or a prolonged course of very bad driving, or bad driving to avoid apprehension.",2
538,"Some less culpable forms of bad driving might also be labelled ‘reckless’, a momentary dozing-off at the wheel, or the failure to notice a pedestrian on a crossing.",2
539,"these two offences, there is a homicide offence of causing death by reckless driving (section 1 of the 1972 Act).",2
540,"The elements of the offence are exactly the same as for reckless driving, with the extra element of causing death.",2
541,"It will readily be noticed that the elements of causing death by reckless driving are virtually the same as those of ‘reckless manslaughter’: indeed, in (1983) the House of Lords held that they are the same, and the only doubt arises over the reference to ‘substantial damage to property’ in the test.",2
542,"An obvious risk of property damage alone is insufficient for manslaughter, but may suffice for the driving offences.",2
543,"The driving offence of ‘causing death’ was first introduced in 1956, largely because juries were unwilling to convict culpable motorists of such a serious-sounding offence as manslaughter.",2
544,"The  position now seems to be that the two offences have the same legal definition, and that the prosecution should prefer the charge of manslaughter when the case is a bad one which might merit a sentence the five-year maximum for causing death by reckless driving.",2
545,"Ever since the offence of causing death by reckless driving was introduced (it formerly included causing death by dangerous driving, too), there have been those who have pointed to its ‘illogicality’.",2
546,The difference between an offence of reckless driving (maximum penalty of two years) and one of causing death by reckless driving (maximum penalty of five years) may simply be one of chance.,2
547,"Bad driving may or may not lead to an accident, the chance conjunction of other factors and other people's behaviour.",2
548,And an accident may lead to death (in which case the more serious offence is committed) or merely to serious injuries or to minor damage.,2
549,"The response to this ‘illogicality’— which is, , the very problem with the law of involuntary manslaughter too — has varied in recent English proposals.",2
550,"Both the James Committee in 1976 and the Criminal Law Revision Committee in 1980 recommended the abolition of the offence of causing death by reckless driving, thereby accepting the ‘illogicality’ argument.",2
551,This accords with the CLRC's proposal that both ‘unlawful act’ manslaughter and reckless manslaughter should be abolished.,2
552,"However, the report of the Road Traffic Law Review has reversed this trend.",2
553,"The Review accepts the general principle that persons should be judged the intrinsic quality of their driving its consequences, but argues that the law should depart from this in cases where death is caused and the driver's culpability is already high.",2
554,This is a frank recognition of the tension created by cases where there is the supreme harm (death) combined with some culpability but no foresight of the risk of death.,2
555,"There is a well-known risk in motoring that certain kinds of driving may cause accidents, and that accidents may cause death.",2
556,"The rules of the road are designed not only to produce the orderly and unhampered movement of traffic, but also to protect property, safety, and lives.",2
557,One who deviates so manifestly from these rules drive recklessly  ought to realize — because the driving test requires a driver to realize — that there is a considerable risk of an accident.,2
558,"If an accident happens as a result of driving which deviates from the proper standard, then that may well be a case of negligence the driver had never thought of the risk in that particular case, because the driver is presumed to know the Highway Code.",2
559,It is this negligence which is termed ‘recklessness’ by the decisions in and .,2
560,"There is, however, another dimension to the debate, and this appears from the CLRC's view that, where reckless driving causes death, this should not affect the label of the offence but may be treated as an aggravating factor in sentencing in appropriate cases.",2
561,"This assumes that there is a tension between the causing of serious harm (death) and the relatively low fault (‘recklessness’, as here defined), and that this tension should be resolved the fault element when we are deciding on the labels of offences, thereby making no reference to the result, but should be resolved the serious harm when sentencing, increasing the sentence the gravity of the resulting harm.",2
562,", we should call the offence reckless driving, but the occurrence of death, it may be regarded as bad luck, should aggravate the sentence.",2
563,Is it defensible to have different principles for sentencing and for the labelling of offences?,2
564,"Much depends on the social function of labelling criminal offences, and on the particular labels chosen.",2
565,"We are referring here to the offence of causing death by reckless driving, not to manslaughter.",2
566,"It is therefore, one may assume, a label of intermediate stigma (falling short of the stigma attached to the offence of manslaughter).",2
567,"The fault element is fairly substantial, since the definition refers to an obvious and serious risk of substantial damage to property: there will be few cases where only such damage, and no risk to personal safety, is involved; moreover, as argued above, a major reason for having rules of the road which all drivers should know is to reduce the risk of injuries and deaths resulting.",2
568,"Retaining the more serious label which refers to the causing of death may therefore perform a useful educative function; it is hardly unfair to the driver, since this is the very risk against which the rules are intended to guard.",2
569,"sentencing, English courts have been unclear about the proper approach.",2
570,"In (1984), a case of  careless driving where a death resulted, the Court of Appeal held that the proper basis for sentence is ‘the quality of driving, the extent to which the appellant on the particular occasion fell below the standard of the reasonably competent driver’, to which ‘the unforeseen and unexpected results of the carelessness’ are not relevant.",2
571,"However, there are other decisions which have taken account of unexpected and chance results as aggravating factors.",2
572,"The problem, surely, is to find a satisfactory starting-point for the level of sentences.",2
573,"The degree of risk created by the bad driving should be regarded as the crucial factor; it is not so much a question of whether the sentence should be more severe when the risk eventuates, as whether the sentence should be more lenient when the risk does not materialize.",2
574,"If the aim of the rules of the road is to protect safety, and if the driver broke those rules in a way which may be labelled ‘reckless’, then the risk has been taken and the sentence should not be affected significantly by the materialization or non-materialization of the risk.",2
575,"But, as a risk to safety taken recklessly, the offence deserves a penalty which places it above many intentional offences against property.",2
576,"The argument, then, is that the causing of death by bad driving should not be regarded as a significant aggravating factor, but nor should the non-causing of death or injury be regarded as a significant mitigating factor.",2
577,"The level of sentence should be set primarily, as the Lord Chief Justice stated in , ‘the degree of carelessness and culpability’.",2
578,"It will therefore be seen that many of the issues involved here are similar to those raised by the law of involuntary manslaughter, the fact that driving offences constitute deviations from a code of conduct on which all persons are tested before they are granted driving-licences.",2
579,"This factor serves to distinguish driving cases from those of deaths resulting from a single punch, and also to bolster the argument that the penalties for the former should be higher than for the latter.",2
580,7.7 ENDANGERMENT IN OTHER SITUATIONS,2
581,"Our discussion so far has stressed the relationship between endangerment on the roads and the detailed rules of the road, including the driving test.",2
582,"Some preventive rules, together with  endangerment offences, can be seen in a variety of other situations, but nowhere is there such a detailed and fairly widely known set of standards as that applicable to drivers on the roads.",2
583,", there are regulations about the storage of explosives, and the dangers of handling explosives are well known.",2
584,"The main thrust of the Explosives Act 1883, however, is contained in the offences of causing an explosion likely to endanger life (section 2), and the possession of explosives with intent to endanger life (section 3).",2
585,"The latter offence is an inchoate offence of a familiar kind: possession with intent, in circumstances where an innocent reason for possessing explosives is fairly hard to come by (unless the defendant is engaged in quarrying or another business in which explosives are used).",2
586,"The justification for the possession offence is preventive, and there is little difficulty in holding that a person caught explosives with intent to endanger life has sufficiently crossed the threshold of criminality to justify punishment.",2
587,"True, there may yet be the possibility of repentance as the time for using the explosives draws near, but the very step of taking explosives into one's Possession with this intent is culpable.",2
588,"the endangerment offence itself, two features in section 2 of the 1883 Act stand out.",2
589,"One is that no actual endangerment is required: the explosion need only have been inherently likely to endanger life, and the offence is committed anyone's life was put in danger.",2
590,"In its style of labelling, therefore, this differs from the present driving law, with its separate offences of reckless driving and causing death by reckless driving: the equivalent would be a single offence of driving in a manner likely to endanger life.",2
591,The second feature of the offence of causing an explosion likely to endanger life is that there appears to be no distinct fault requirement.,2
592,"the prosecution proves that D caused the explosion, and that the explosion was likely to endanger life, that would suffice for conviction.",2
593,"The reason for this must be that one can hardly cause an explosion without realizing that one is about to do so, and that explosions usually create danger and must be known to do so, unless they are carefully controlled in an area members of the public.",2
594,"However, these arguments are not particularly strong, for, if the inference of fault is so great, why not include a requirement of proof of fault, at the level of subjective recklessness?",2
595,Further offences of endangerment may be found in the Firearms  Act 1968.,2
596,"Section 16 contains an offence of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life, which corresponds to the offence under section 3 of the Explosives Act.",2
597,"Again, the circumstances of the possession are likely to raise an inference of intent, unless the possession was clearly connected with some authorised shooting activity.",2
598,There are then three possession offences of a slightly different type.,2
599,"Section 18 penalizes the possession of a firearm with intent to commit a crime or to resist arrest: this is a more specific variation of section 16, catering for the defence that the firearm was being carried for use in a robbery but with no intention that it would actually be used to endanger anyone, only to frighten — that would be a section 18 offence.",2
600,"Section 19 penalises possession of a loaded firearm in a public place, presumably in circumstances where the section 16 offence cannot be proved, but on the argument that the mere possession is sufficiently dangerous because accidents can happen with loaded guns, and the consequences might be life-endangering.",2
601,"Section 20 penalizes possession of a firearm when trespassing: again, there might be a defence to a section 16 charge if D was merely intending to shoot animals or fowl, but the gun could be turned on a human being and therefore represents a source of danger.",2
602,What these firearms offences appear to amount to is a criminalization of the carrying of firearms in all but the most innocent of contexts.,2
603,"If the firearm is discharged and property is damaged, then an offence of criminal damage may be charged.",2
604,"If it is discharged and a person is injured or killed, the appropriate offence against the person can be charged.",2
605,What the Firearms Act provides is a series of inchoate or preventive offences which criminalize conduct even before it has reached the stage of an attempt to commit some substantive offence.,2
606,"The offences do not require any endangerment : that is taken to be inherent in the carrying of firearms, since their potentialities are grave and the risk of accidents deliberate use is well known.",2
607,"Offences relating to the operation of aircraft, ships, and railways have not been prominent in the practice of English criminal law.",2
608,"But the law does contain such offences, and it is more a matter of prosecutors making little use of them.",2
609,"It is true that over the years a few railway signalmen have been convicted of manslaughter for wrongful acts and omissions leading to fatal train crashes, but there is not the natural resort to the criminal law which is now a feature of road-traffic cases.",2
610,"In a sense, greater values are at stake in the operation of aircraft, ships, and railways, because many lives are  involved, more than would normally be risked by the bad driving of a motor vehicle (although there is an important exception here in the operation of buses and coaches, which are more akin to planes, boats, and trains).",2
611,"But there is another significant difference between the individual driving a car or a lorry and all these other forms of transport, and that is the chain of responsibility.",2
612,"A company's management policies might be just as much to blame for a particular ‘accident’ as the actions of the driver, pilot, or captain: Sheen J made this point in his report on the Zeebrugge ferry disaster, but English prosecution practice has tended not to invoke the criminal law against managers of transport systems.",2
613,"One reason for this may be the doctrine of corporate liability in English criminal law (discussed in Chapter 4.3, and found to be unsatisfactory); , it may be difficult to establish the fault necessary for manslaughter, although easier to secure a conviction under legislation on railways or merchant shipping.",2
614,"There may also be a reluctance among prosecutors to look beyond the individual driver, pilot, or captain in each case.",2
615,It is not just the operation of systems of transport which is a source of endangerment: the actions of individuals may be designed to take advantage of the possibility of causing several deaths .,2
616,"The longest determinate prison sentence ever upheld by English courts was the sentence of forty-five years' imprisonment in the case of (1988), a man who sent his pregnant girlfriend on a flight with a bag which contained a bomb timed to destroy the aircraft and its 350 passengers in mid-flight.",2
617,"The offence in this was ‘an attempt to place on an aircraft a device likely to destroy or damage the aircraft, the Aviation Security Act 1982’— an inchoate offence, and one worded without any express reference to the endangerment of lives.",2
618,"The sentence, however, was intended to reflect the attempt to kill so many people.",2
619,"Injuries and deaths at work are a significant and reducible source of danger to the citizen, and the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 provides the framework for the regulation of safety in work-places with an offence of failing to ensure that, ‘so far as is reasonably practicable’, employees are not exposed to risks to their health or safety.",2
620,"Other fragmentary legislation is to be found in recent years, e.g. the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.",2
621,"However, all these specific offences of endangerment, English law does contain one fairly wide-ranging offence, and that is the aggravated offence of criminal damage.",2
622,Under section 1(2) of the Criminal Damage Act 1971 it is an offence — punishable with life imprisonment — to damage property ‘intending by the destruction or damage to endanger the life of another or being reckless whether the life of another would be thereby endangered’.,2
623,"Criminal damage itself is an offence carrying ten years' imprisonment, but this is a more serious offence — more of an offence against the person.",2
624,One might well ask how important the element of criminal damage is to the rationale of the aggravated offence.,2
625,"One answer could be that, where the damage is caused by fire, the consequent danger to life may be similar to that created by an explosion, and the inferences may be the same: who could cause such a fire in such a place without appreciating the danger to others?",2
626,"However, the major question raised by section I(2) of the Criminal Damage Act is why English law does not have a general offence of endangerment.",2
627,"Why should the fact that D was engaged on causing damage to property at the time (even damage to D's own property) make his conduct into an offence punishable with life imprisonment when, if D were engaged on some other activity, it would not be punishable as such and would only amount to manslaughter if a death happened to be caused?",2
628,"Section 211.2 of the Model Penal Code has been enacted into the laws of many American states, providing a general endangerment offence.",2
629,The offence is committed where a person recklessly engages in conduct which places another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury.,2
630,"It does not require any result, although it does require actual danger.",2
631,"Its great merit is that it is not confined to particular activities, and therefore has an across-the-board application to different sources of endangerment.",2
632,"On the other hand, such a general offence does not fulfil the educative function of singling out situations which carry a particular risk of danger.",2
633,"For that reason, it would be wise to retain a special offence for road-traffic cases, and there may be merit in retaining offences with particular labels in other spheres.",2
634,What is more pertinent is whether the different styles of the offences discussed above have some justification.,2
635,"Should the fault standard require D's actual awareness, or merely an objective probability of danger?",2
636,"Should there be proof of actual danger to someone, or is potential danger enough?",2
637,NON-FATAL VIOLATIONS OF THE PERSON,2
638,8.1 VARIETIES OF PHYSICAL VIOLATION,2
639,"In this chapter we shall be discussing two main forms of physical violation: the use of physical force, and sexual assaults.",2
640,"It is quite obvious that each type of violence varies considerably in its degree: physical force can be anything from a mere push to a brutal beating which leaves the victim close to death, and a sexual assault may be anything from a brief touching to a gross form of sexual violation.",2
641,"One problem which the criminal law has to confront, therefore, when dealing with physical violation, is how to grade the seriousness of the conduct.",2
642,The variations are so wide that it would contravene both the principle of fair labelling (see Chapter 3.3 (1)) and the principle of maximum certainty (see Chapter 3.3 (i)) if there were just a single offence of non-fatal harm and a single offence of sexual assault: this would often leave little to be decided at the trial and would transfer the effective decision to the sentencing stage.,2
643,"it would be unsatisfactory to have a single offence, then the question is how best to divide up the forms and degrees of physical violation and of sexual assault.",2
644,We shall look first at physical violation.,2
645,"Although many cases of sexual assault also involve significant physical violation, this is not always so, and the essence of many sexual assaults lies in their destruction of the freedom of choice in the most intimate area of personality, and in psychological damage.",2
646,"By considering physical violations first, this will enable us to identify more accurately the distinctive element in sexual assaults.",2
647,"The general term ‘sexual assault’ is used here to include non-consensual sexual offences: there are various forms of sexual activity which are criminal they are indulged in consensually by adults of sound mind, and there was a brief discussion of these in Chapter 2.1 and 2.4 (b).",2
648,8.2 REPORTED PHYSICAL VIOLATIONS,2
649,"Recent decades have seen significant increases in the numbers of offences of violence reported to, and recorded by, the police.",2
650,"Between 1974 and 1984 the rise was 72 , slightly above that for all recorded offences (69 ).",2
651,"The increases were lowest in the most serious forms of violent offences, and highest in the less serious offences of violence and in robbery.",2
652,"Three-quarters of these offences each year are ‘cleared up’, and it transpires that most of them are committed by young males aged between 14 and 29.",2
653,"It seems that the use of a weapon is important in determining the legal classification of offences (not surprisingly, since offences involving weapons may tend to have more serious consequences): some three-quarters of the serious woundings involved a weapon, whereas the proportion was only one-fifth for the less serious offences.",2
654,"Patterns of victimization vary: females are more likely to fall victim to violence in their homes; whilst males are more likely to fall victim to violence in a ‘road, street or park’, or in a place of recreation.",2
655,"This trend may in fact be more marked, since it is acknowledged that victims may be considerably reluctant to report, and police to record, offences of violence committed in the home.",2
656,"Recent studies are beginning to uncover the true extent of so-called ‘domestic’ violence, and many police forces have adopted more consistent policies of recording such incidents and dealing with them as true offences of violence.",2
657,Two particular points may be made about offences of physical violation.,2
658,"First, there is evidence of a strong correlation between drinking and violence, in the sense that large numbers of violent offences are committed after consuming alcohol.",2
659,"It may be added, , that most of those who drink alcohol do not commit offences of violence thereafter.",2
660,"But the first point remains, and means that the special rules relating to fault and intoxication, discussed in Chapter 6.3, come into play.",2
661,A second general point is  that many offences of violence have consequences for the victim which extend well beyond any injury caused.,2
662,"There are psychological effects of fear and depression, which may significantly impair the victim's enjoyment of life long after the physical wounds have healed.",2
663,Such effects are well documented in the case of female victims of ‘domestic’ violence.,2
664,The values which underlie the offences of physical violation are not far to seek.,2
665,"They are the values of physical autonomy and freedom from molestation, the liberty to decide for oneself the level of pain to subject one's body to (e.g. in sport).",2
666,"The value of privacy is central here: the body is part of one's private identity, and, any physical hurt inflicted by violence, a violent assault constitutes a challenge to one's personal identity, peace, and wellbeing.",2
667,OFFENCES OF NON-FATAL PHYSICAL VIOLATION,2
668,We have seen something of the various situations in which non-fatal physical harm might occur.,2
669,How does the law classify its offences?,2
670,"How should it respond to these various invasions of physical integrity, a quality which is highly valued by most citizens?",2
671,"One approach would be to create separate offences to cover many of the situations in which violence occurs, and to single out those situations in which there is some element of aggravation, attacks on law-enforcement officers.",2
672,"This was the nineteenth-century English approach, and many such offences still survive in the Offences against the Person Act 1861 (relating, , to injuries caused by gunpowder, throwing corrosive fluid, failing to provide food for apprentices, setting spring guns).",2
673,A second approach would be to attempt to rank the offences by reference to the degree of harm caused and the degree of fault in the person causing it.,2
674,"The 1861 Act also contains some offences of this kind, but, as we shall see below, its ranking is impaired by obscure terms, uncertainties in the fault requirements, and some overlapping.",2
675,Thorough reform of the law is long overdue.,2
676,(a) Attempted Murder,2
677,"If we were to construct a ‘ladder’ of non-fatal offences, starting with the most serious and moving down to the least serious, the offence  of attempted murder should be placed at the top.",2
678,"There is an immediate paradox here though: attempted murder may not involve the infliction of any harm , since a person who shoots at another and misses may still be held guilty of attempted murder.",2
679,"What distinguishes this offence is proof of an intention to kill, not the occurrence of any particular harm.",2
680,"The fault element for attempted murder is therefore high — higher than for murder, under English law, since murder may be committed by someone who merely intended to cause really serious injury and not death.",2
681,An intention to kill must be proved to convict someone of attempted murder.,2
682,"Beyond that, all that is necessary is proof that D did something which was ‘more than merely preparatory’ towards the murder.",2
683,"Although a conviction is perfectly possible where no harm results — and such a case might still be regarded as a most serious non-fatal offence, since D tried to cause death, and the subjective principles confirm the high guilt — there are also cases where D's attempt to kill results in serious injury to the victim.",2
684,In such cases a prosecution might be brought for attempted murder — and will succeed if the intention to kill can be proved.,2
685,"However, the court might not be satisfied of that ‘beyond reasonable doubt’, and might find that D only intended to cause grievous bodily harm.",2
686,"In that event, the conviction will be for the offence of causing grievous bodily harm, but both offences carry the same maximum punishment — life imprisonment.",2
687,(b) Wounding or Grievous Bodily Harm (GBH) with Intent,2
688,Section 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 creates a serious offence which may be committed in a number of different ways.,2
689,"There are two alternative forms of conduct, and either of two forms of intent will suffice.",2
690,The conduct may be either causing a wound or causing grievous bodily harm.,2
691,A wound has been defined as an injury which breaks both the outer and inner skin — a bruise or a burst blood-vessel in an eye would not amount to a wound.,2
692,"Grievous bodily harm has never been defined with any precision, and the authoritative description is ‘really serious harm’.",2
693,"Turning  to the fault requirements, the one most commonly relied on in prosecutions is ‘with intent to cause grievous bodily harm’.",2
694,The meaning of ‘intention’ here is the same as outlined earlier.,2
695,"It was observed above that most serious woundings involve the use of a weapon, and that may make it easier to establish intention.",2
696,"Where the prosecution fails to establish intention, the offence will be reduced to the lower category, to be considered in section 8.3 (c) below, recklessness is proved.",2
697,But there is an alternative fault element: ‘with intent to prevent the lawful apprehension or detainer of any person’.,2
698,"Whilst the policy of this requirement — classifying attacks on persons engaged in law enforcement as especially serious — is perfectly understandable, one result of the wording of section 18 of the 1861 Act is that D can be convicted of this offence (with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment) if he simply pushes a police-officer to prevent an arrest, and the officer loses balance, falls awkwardly, and suffers serious injury.",2
699,"There is no requirement that such serious results should have been foreseen or foreseeable, D was trying to prevent an arrest.",2
700,This is a stark example of constructive criminal liability.,2
701,(c) Reckless Wounding or GBH,2
702,Section 20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 creates the offence of unlawfully and maliciously wounding or inflicting grievous bodily harm.,2
703,"The conduct element in this offence is similar to that for the more serious offence under section 18, and the meanings of ‘wound’ and ‘grievous bodily harm’are no different.",2
704,"Considerable attention has been focused on the distinction between grievous bodily harm (section 18) and grievous bodily harm (section 20): for many years it was believed that the more restrictive word ‘inflict’ meant that section 20 required proof of a sufficiently direct action by D to constitute an assault, but the House of Lords has now decided that there can be an ‘infliction’of GBH without proof of an assault.",2
705,"The decision is controversial in its reasoning, but it may be explained as an attempt by the judiciary to improve the workability of an ageing legal structure.",2
706,"The main difference between sections 18 and 20 lies in the fault element, and it is a considerable difference.",2
707,Section 18 requires intention.,2
708,"Section 20 requires recklessness, in the common-law sense of the conscious taking of an unjustified risk.",2
709,"The fault element in section 20 has been further broadened by the decision in (1968): there is no need to prove recklessness wounding or grievous bodily harm, the court is satisfied that D was reckless some physical harm to some person, albeit of a minor character.",2
710,"This is another example of constructive liability, and it is particularly inappropriate here, the law is aiming to produce a ‘ladder’ of offences graded relative seriousness.",2
711,"However, even without the extension, one might ask whether the distinction between intention (section 18) and recklessness (section 20) is so wide in crimes of violence, often impulsive reactions to events, warrant the difference in maximum penalties between life imprisonment and five years' imprisonment.",2
712,(d) Aggravated Assaults,2
713,"Common assault is the lowest rung of the ‘ladder’ of non-fatal offences, with a maximum penalty of six months' imprisonment, and it is discussed in more detail below.",2
714,"But certain aggravated assaults are singled out by the law for higher maximum penalties, and three of them may be mentioned here.",2
715,"One is assault with intent to rob, which, like robbery, carries a maximum of life imprisonment: it is, in effect, an offence of attempted robbery.",2
716,"Another aggravated offence is assault with intent to resist arrest or to prevent a lawful arrest, section 38 of the 1861 Act and carrying a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment.",2
717,"The third, which is usually regarded as representing the rung of the ‘ladder’ below reckless wounding or GBH (section 20) but above common assault, is assault occasioning actual bodily harm.",2
718,"The conduct element is causing ‘actual bodily harm’, which has been given the wide definition of ‘any hurt or injury calculated to interfere with the health or comfort of the victim’ it is not merely transient or trifling'.",2
719,"One consequence of the breadth of this  definition is that it has been held to cover psychological harm — where D causes V to become hysterical or to suffer substantial fear or fright, .",2
720,"24 Since research shows that this is a frequent and long-lasting result of many attacks, it is important that it be given some recognition.",2
721,"The fault required for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, section 47 of the 1861 Act, is now in doubt.",2
722,"Formerly, all that needed to be established was the fault required for common assault, i.e. intent or recklessness the application of some unlawful force to another.",2
723,This was open to the criticism that it imposed constructive liability: a person who risked a minor assault might be held guilty of a more serious offence if ‘actual bodily harm’ happened to result.,2
724,"Moreover, the maximum penalty for the section 47 offence is five years' imprisonment, with no apparent justification for the strange approach of making the equivalent to the higher offence on the ‘ladder’(the section 20 offence), and the equivalent to the lower offence on the ‘ladder’(common assault, with a maximum of six months' imprisonment).",2
725,"However, the Court of Appeal has now attempted to rectify the anomaly by holding that the prosecution must prove intention or recklessness physical harm, not a mere assault.",2
726,"The Court was critical of the antiquated and illogical structure of the 1861 Act, which causes practical problems and yet remains unreformed.",2
727,Section 51 of the Police Act 1964 contains the offence of assaulting a police-officer in the execution of his or her duty.,2
728,"Procedurally speaking, this is not an aggravated assault, since it carries the same maximum penalty as common assault (six months' imprisonment) and is also triable summarily only.",2
729,"However, in practice the courts tend to impose higher sentences for assaults on the police, and it is therefore worth noting that this offence is committed D was unaware that he was striking a police-officer.",2
730,"A decision by a single judge on assize in 1865 is still regarded as authority for this proposition, but there is surely little justification for this today.",2
731,"The  proper approach should be to convict D of the aggravated offence only where he knew that V was, or might be, a police-officer.",2
732,"Otherwise, a conviction for common assault is more appropriate.",2
733,(e) Common Assault,2
734,The lowest offence on the ‘ladder’ is what is known as common assault.,2
735,"Strictly speaking, the term ‘assault’ is used here in its generic sense, as including two separate types of offence, assault and battery.",2
736,"In simple terms, battery is the application of unlawful force to another person, whereas assault consists of causing another person to apprehend or expect the application of unlawful force.",2
737,"Most batteries involve an assault, and the tendency is to refer generically to ‘assaults’, but the exposition of the law is clearer if the two offences are kept separate.",2
738,The essence of a battery is the application of any unlawful force to another.,2
739,"Examples might include a push, a kiss, or throwing a projectile or water which lands on another person's body.",2
740,"Indeed, it seems that the merest touching of another may constitute a battery, and this prompts the question of whether the criminal law ought to extend to such trivial incidents.",2
741,"The traditional justification is that there is no other sensible dividing line, and that this declares the law's regard for the physical integrity of citizens.",2
742,"As Blackstone put it: ‘the law cannot draw the line between different degrees of violence, and therefore totally prohibits the first and lowest stage of it; every man's person being sacred, and no other having a right to meddle with it, in any the slightest manner.’",2
743,"Many unwanted touchings are ‘technical’ batteries, and prosecutors are relied upon to avoid prosecutions of minor incidents.",2
744,"One might be able to construct a law which penalized only those batteries which cause, or are likely to cause, significant annoyance, but it is doubtful whether the insertion of a (necessarily vague) standard would alter the nature of the problem.",2
745,"Individuals have a right not to be touched if they do not wish to be touched, since the body is private.",2
746,Someone who knowingly touches another without his consent violates this personal right as surely as if he had taken his property.,2
747,"This is most evident in cases of indecent assault, which may be committed by the least unwanted touching or stroking of one person's body by another.",2
748,"These are culpable acts, often regarded as being more serious than thefts of property.",2
749,"If the law is  to recognise the significance of the individual's physical integrity, then it must provide for offences of this kind some of the conduct falling within the definition of the offence is properly kept the courts by prosecutorial discretion.",2
750,There are a number of disputed points about the ambit of the offence of battery.,2
751,"There is no clear decision on whether battery can be committed by the indirect application of force by digging a hole into which people subsequently fall, , but there are judicial statements including indirect force.",2
752,"One major problem is that if the offence is defined to include all touchings to which the victim does not consent, it seems difficult to exclude everyday physical contact with others.",2
753,This could be resolved by assuming that all citizens impliedly consent to those touchings which are incidental to ordinary everyday life and travel; but the judicial preference seems to be to create an exception for ‘all physical contact which is generally acceptable in the ordinary conduct of daily life’.,2
754,"The cases decide that this exception extends to touching a person to attract attention, although there can be no exception when the person touched has made it clear that he or she does not wish to be touched again.",2
755,The problem arose in ,2
756,"(1984), where a police — officer, not empowered to arrest D, touched D to attract her attention and then subsequently took hold of D's arm.",2
757,"D proceeded to scratch the police — officer's arm, having previously made it clear — in colourful language — that she did not wish to talk to the police — officer.",2
758,"The Divisional Court quashed D's conviction for assaulting a police-officer in the execution of her duty, on the ground that the officer herself had assaulted D by taking hold of D's arm.",2
759,The key issue here was D's obvious refusal of consent to any touching; in other cases there might be a general issue of whether the touching goes ‘beyond generally acceptable standards of conduct’.,2
760,A number of decisions have suggested what appears to be an alternative Approach: to ask whether D's touching was ‘hostile’.,2
761,"This seems to be an inferior method of identifying the question of the boundaries of permissible conduct, and it is arguable whether this requirement forms part of the criminal law.",2
762,"The essence of the crime of assault, as distinct from battery, is that it involves an apprehension of the immediate application of unlawful force.",2
763,"It is therefore possible to have a battery without an assault (e.g. where D strikes V from behind), an assault without a battery (e.g. where D threatens to strike V but is prevented from doing so), but most cases involve both.",2
764,"One disputed point is whether words alone can constitute an assault: the preponderance of authority is probably that mere words, unaccompanied by any threatening conduct, cannot amount to an assault, but if the point of the offence is to penalize the creation of fear of imminent attack, it is difficult to see why utterances ‘Get out the knives’ or ‘Let's hit them’should be regarded more indulgently than a raised hand.",2
765,Another disputed issue concerns the ambit of immediacy.,2
766,"In one case the Divisional Court held that assault was committed where a woman was frightened by the sight of a man looking in through the window of her house, although there seems to have been little suggestion that the man was threatening to apply force either immediately or .",2
767,The decision might be explained as an attempt to remedy the absence of an offence which penalizes such .,2
768,"It is a different matter if D intends to cause, and does cause V to the immediate application of force in a case where none is objectively likely (e.g. the gun which D points at V is a toy).",2
769,"That clearly fulfils the definition of assault, and rightly so.",2
770,What fault element is required for assault and battery?,2
771,The law is now settled that either intention or recklessness the respective conduct elements is sufficient.,2
772,"After a brief period of uncertainty, it is now clear that common-law recklessness, not recklessness, is the relevant test.",2
773,"There remains, however, a question of principle which has not been fully considered: should the fault element in offences against the person be widened to criminalize some negligent causing of physical harm?",2
774,"If physical integrity is so highly valued, would it be inappropriate to make it clear that an  offence would be committed by any normal adult who failed to see an obvious risk of physical harm to another?",2
775,(f) Questions of Consent,2
776,"to explain why offences of violence are regarded so seriously, reference has been made to the value a of privacy and physical integrity.",2
777,"However, if individual autonomy is to be regarded as one of the fundamental values, the question arises of whether individuals might consent to the infliction of physical harm on themselves.",2
778,The owner of property can consent to someone destroying or damaging that property.,2
779,We shall see below that consent may constitute the difference between the sexual expression of shared love between two people and the serious offence of rape.,2
780,"If a person wishes to give up his physical integrity in certain circumstances, or to risk it for the sake of sport or excitement, should the criminal law allow the consent to negative what would otherwise be a crime?",2
781,The Court of Appeal was asked to rule on this question in ,2
782,).,2
783,The reference concerned a fight in the street between two youths to settle an argument.,2
784,The essence of the court's answer was that ‘It is not in the public interest that people should try to cause or should cause actual bodily harm for no good reason.’,2
785,"In other words, the Court held that, if the fight merely involves assault or battery, consent can be effective as a defence.",2
786,But if the results constitute actual bodily harm — which extends to ‘any hurt or injury calculated to interfere with the health or comfort of the victim’— consent cannot be a defence.,2
787,This applies whether the fight takes place or .,2
788,The Lord Chief Justice added that:,2
789,"Nothing which we have said is intended to cast doubt on the accepted legality of properly conducted games and sports, lawful chastisement or correction, reasonable surgical interference, dangerous exhibitions, etc.",2
790,"These apparent exceptions can be justified as involving the exercise of a legal right, in the case of chastisement or correction, or as needed in the public interest, in the other cases.",2
791,This passage is somewhat unsatisfactory in its lack of certainty and in the wide discretion it appears to leave to the courts.,2
792,"It is true that the did not confront these particular issues directly, and the Lord Chief Justice perhaps intended no more than a sweeping reference to other kindred situations.",2
793,"But the allusion to ‘properly conducted’ games or sports is vague, and the notion that such dangerous exhibitions as circus acts or trying to vault over twelve buses on a motorcycle are ‘needed’in the public interest seems strained.",2
794,Beneath all these particular situations there are conflicting values which claim the law's attention.,2
795,"Fundamental respect for individuals as autonomous, rational beings suggests that their liberty to risk injury or to undergo assaults, however serious, ought also to be respected.",2
796,"It is an aspect of self-determination: the point is conceded in the fact that suicide is an offence, and it should therefore follow that consent to injury should negative any offence.",2
797,"That argument is not watertight, however, because existing law does not allow euthanasia.",2
798,"What distinguishes suicide from euthanasia is that the former is the individual's own act, whereas the latter involves the direct act of another.",2
799,Why should this make so great a difference?,2
800,"It seems that problems of proof loom large here: there is a fear that the unscrupulous would manipulate any law permitting ‘mercy killings’, and the argument is presumably that this would put at risk more unwilling parties than a law allowing euthanasia would benefit willing parties.",2
801,"There are those, however, who find it objectionable that one person should ever be permitted to take the life of another.",2
802,"If we bring the argument back to consent to non-fatal physical harm, we may recall that the Lord Chief Justice relied on the phrase ‘not in the public interest’ to justify the restrictions.",2
803,This phrase must be regarded as the starting-point for analysis as an explanation.,2
804,"One reason that he ruled out was the argument, derived from earlier cases, that fights should be prohibited because they tend to create disorder.",2
805,"This may be true, but there are other offences to deal with that aspect, and, in any case, violence raises the same issues of physical integrity and self-determination.",2
806,"Another old argument is that ‘manly sports’ help to keep people fit to fight for the Crown if necessary, whereas fights which involve maiming rob the Crown of able-bodied men for  the armed forces.",2
807,"Although this precise reasoning is of doubtful relevance today, it contains the seeds of an argument to the effect that the public interest lies in having a society with fit and healthy citizens.",2
808,"Several laws have been passed in modern times to restrict dangerous activities and to impose criminal sanctions on citizens who fail to protect themselves against injury — , the offences of failing to wear a safety helmet when riding a motor cycle, and failing to wear a safety harness when travelling in the front seat of a car.",2
809,"Such laws are partly paternalistic, based on the argument that the State is in a better position to assess the risks of injury, and partly economic, in the sense that conformity with the law would save millions of pounds in medical expenses (as well as much grief for citizens).",2
810,Thus one social argument which might be mobilised the rule in the case is that the savings of medical expenses resulting from conformity with the law are more important than the liberty of individual citizens to engage in fights.,2
811,That is a matter for debate.,2
812,A further paternalistic argument is that a law restricting consent helps to protect individual citizens from themselves by counteracting some of the social pressures and shame which might otherwise occur.,2
813,"The criminal law took a strong line against duelling in the nineteenth century, despite the notions of honour which still regarded it as appropriate or correct for settling certain disputes.",2
814,"Similar pressures might be felt by some people today — to fight, or to risk injury in certain situations, .",2
815,"On the other hand, the extent to which judicial decisions can influence patterns of social behaviour must remain an open question.",2
816,"Physical sports would probably be widely accepted as an exception to restrictive rules on consent, but two points must be borne in mind.",2
817,"First, there has been a growing number of prosecutions in recent years for injuries resulting from organized matches of Association and Rugby football.",2
818,"It is accepted that not every ‘foul’ committed in breach of the rules amounts to a crime, and it seems to be assumed that players do, and may lawfully, consent to physical force over and above the minimum permitted by the rules.",2
819,"But this does not exclude the possibility of convictions for the use of physical  force well beyond that which may reasonably be expected in a game: the borderline is vague, but presumably the courts will decide particular cases by reference to the degree of violence used, its relation to the play in the game, any evidence of intent, .",2
820,"Second, there should be constant reappraisal of the suitability of certain forms of ‘sport’.",2
821,"Advances in medical knowledge might lead to the conclusion that some are simply too dangerous: there has long been a debate about the status of boxing, with increasing knowledge of the risks of brain damage to boxers.",2
822,"Here, as elsewhere, there are difficult questions to be answered: whether membership of a society should involve a positive duty to take care of one's body for the general social good, either to avoid becoming a burden on other members of the community or even to preserve oneself as a positive contributor to that community.",2
823,"The question of ‘positive contribution’ raises again the issue of the social worth of sport, recreation and dangerous exhibitions.",2
824,(g) Offences under the Public Order Act 1986,2
825,"Despite its title, the Public Order Act creates some offences which apply whether the conduct takes place in a public or a private place.",2
826,Of particular relevance here are those offences which involve violence or the threat of violence.,2
827,"The Act provides a ‘ladder’ of offences, of which the most serious is riot (section i).",2
828,The essence of riot is the use of unlawful violence by two or more persons in a group of twelve persons who are using or threatening violence.,2
829,"The maximum penalty is ten years' imprisonment, compared with a maximum of five years for the lesser offence of violent disorder.",2
830,The essence of violent disorder (section 2) is the use or threat of unlawful violence in a group of three persons who are using or threatening violence.,2
831,"Beneath violent disorder comes the crime of affray (section 3), now defined threatening or using unlawful violence towards another, and carrying a maximum of three years' imprisonment.",2
832,"Affray may be committed by one individual, and, like the other offences, it may be committed in a private place.",2
833,"The term ‘violence’ includes conduct intended to cause physical harm and conduct which might cause harm (throwing a missile towards someone); and, for the two most serious offences of riot and violent disorder, ‘violence’bears an extended meaning which includes violent conduct towards property.",2
834,Is it necessary to have an extra ladder of offences so closely linked with the general ladder of offences of violence?,2
835,One reason might be the unsatisfactory state of the law under the Offences against the Person Act 1861: that Act fails to provide both a clear and defensible gradation of offences and any general offences of threatening violence against another.,2
836,"The provisions of the Public Order Act are, however, usually justified on other grounds.",2
837,"One supposed justification is that these extra offences are needed to cope with ‘group offending’, which causes fear in ordinary citizens, and extra difficulties for the police and for prosecutors (in obtaining persuasive evidence).",2
838,"Offences committed by groups may well occasion greater fear than offences committed by individuals, and it may also be true that groups have a tendency to do things which individuals might not do: there is a group bravado, a group pressure, which may lead to excesses.",2
839,"On the other hand, the criminal law already makes some provision for such cases.",2
840,"The law of conspiracy is aimed at group offending, but conviction depends on proof of some prior agreement.",2
841,"The law of complicity enables the conviction of people who aid and abet others to commit offences, and spreads a fairly wide net in doing so.",2
842,"However, the law of complicity is technical, and the 1986 Public Order Act is a response to the call for a simplified and more ‘practical’ scheme of offences for dealing with public disorder.",2
843,Thus the Act goes a long way in smoothing the path of the prosecutor.,2
844,"It is indeed an element of all three offences that the conduct must be would cause a person of reasonable firmness, present at the scene, to fear for his personal safety; and yet it is provided, for each offence, that ‘no person of reasonable firmness need actually be, or be likely to be, present at the scene’.",2
845,"This not only removes the need for the prosecutor to prove this element, but also removes part of the rationale for the offences.",2
846,"This is ‘practical’ in the sense that the prosecution need not rely on members of the public to come forward and give evidence, which there is often a reluctance to do.",2
847,But one effect of this is to limit the opportunities for the defence to contest the issue.,2
848,"Another justification for having separate ‘public order’ offences is that group activities of this kind may, over and above the features discussed above, constitute a special threat to law enforcement and the political system.",2
849,This argument comes close to a constitutional paradox — that people who are protesting against the fairness of the political system may find themselves convicted of serious offences because their mode of protest is a realistic one.,2
850,"There ought to be a right to protest , it might be argued, and where the exercise of this right happens to lead to some form of disorder, it is wrong to visit the perpetrators with severe sanctions.",2
851,The counter-argument is that peaceful protest is one thing but violent protest crosses the boundaries of acceptability; the value of physical integrity is such that violence and threats of violence ought not to be downgraded simply because their origins lie in some political protest.,2
852,"One problem here is that the two most serious offences include violence against property, conviction may result from threats against a person's property.",2
853,"Another issue is whether a refurbished general code of offences against the person, including clearly graded offences and ‘threats’ offences, would not cater adequately for these occasions.",2
854,This brings the argument back to the justifications for those provisions of the Public Order Act which smooth the path of the prosecutor with dispensations from proof.,2
855,"And yet there remains the fact, noted at the outset, that the Act applies to violence and violent threats .",2
856,Practical experience will determine whether this heralds an assimilation of prosecution policy within public disorder and private or ‘domestic’ violence.,2
857,Would this strengthen the case for a set of offences skewed towards the prosecution?,2
858,(h) Causing Illness,2
859,The Offences against the Person Act 1861 contains a number of crimes concerned with the administration of noxious or toxic substances.,2
860,Section 22 penalizes the use of any overpowering drug or substance ‘with intent to enable the commission of an arrestable offence’(maximum sentence of life imprisonment).,2
861,Section 23 penalizes the intentional or reckless administration of any poison or noxious thing which results in danger to the victim's life or grievous bodily harm (maximum sentence of ten years' imprisonment).,2
862,"Section 24 penalizes the administration of any poison or noxious  thing, ‘with intent to injure, aggrieve or annoy the victim’(maximum sentence of five years).",2
863,"This section has been applied to cover the administration of a drug which causes harm to the victim's metabolism by overstimulation, if D's motive for this is malevolent benevolent.",2
864,"The three offences seem to provide a ‘ladder’ but, , the distinctions between them vary considerably, with section 23 being more concerned about the result than about D's fault.",2
865,"It seems likely that a redefinition of the principal crimes of physical violation would cover most of these cases anyway, and the Criminal Law Revision Committee saw the need to supplement the general offences with only one special offence — administering to another, without his consent, any substance which D knows to be capable of interfering substantially with the other's bodily functions.",2
866,(i) Neglect of Duty,2
867,Several of the offences discussed above may be committed by omission.,2
868,"One can cause grievous bodily harm by omission, and a person who does so intentionally in a case where a duty of care exists may be convicted under section 18 of the 1861 Act.",2
869,"An example would be starving a child for whom one has parental responsibility, with the result that the child suffers serious harm.",2
870,"It is unclear whether battery can be committed by omission, but it is certainly possible to convict of battery someone who accidentally causes the unlawful application of force to another and then intentionally desists from stopping that application of force.",2
871,"The example is the famous case in which a man unintentionally drove his car a police-officer's foot and then declined to remove it, for a minute or two, when asked.",2
872,"There are also cases in which the criminal law creates special offences attached to certain duties of care, of which the parent's duty towards a child is one example.",2
873,Section 1 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 contains an elaborately worded offence which may be termed ‘child neglect’.,2
874,"It consists, essentially, of wilfully assaulting, ill-treating, neglecting, abandoning, or exposing a child in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury  to health.",2
875,"The maximum penalty for child neglect is now ten years' imprisonment, which should be sufficient to deal with cases involving considerable fault and actually or potentially serious consequences.",2
876,"The Mental Health Act 1983 contains a somewhat similar offence of ill-treating or wilfully neglecting a patient in a mental hospital, which has a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment.",2
877,"(j) Weapons, Motor Vehicles, and Endangerment",2
878,Most of the offences considered above involve the occurrence of physical harm plus intention or recklessness.,2
879,"It is also justifiable, however, for the criminal law to penalise conduct which may lead to the causing of physical harm, particularly in situations where the conduct has little social utility or where the risk is well known.",2
880,"In fact, English criminal law has a wide range of such offences, of which those involving firearms, offensive weapons, motor vehicles, and other endangerment will be outlined here.",2
881,"The Firearms Act 1968 sets out to control the possession of firearms and ammunition, and contains several offences.",2
882,"The basic offence in section 1 is that of possessing a firearm without a certificate, an offence which (despite elements of strict liability) carries a maximum of three years' imprisonment.",2
883,"The Act also contains a number of aggravated offences of possessing a firearm with various intents, and these were set out in Chapter 7.7 above.",2
884,"Lower down the scale comes the offence of possessing an offensive weapon without lawful authority or excuse, the Prevention of Crime Act 1953.",2
885,"This offence, with its maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment, encompasses two classes of weapon: first, an article made or adapted for use as a weapon; and second, any article intended for such use.",2
886,"Much attention has been focused on the concept of ‘reasonable excuse’, where the courts have attempted to impose a fairly stringent test on persons whose reason for carrying a weapon is said to be fear of attack.",2
887,"Where motor vehicles are concerned, the problems are different.",2
888,"Although they are no less lethal than firearms in their potential to cause injury or even death, their considerable social utility (indeed, the dependence of much social interaction on them) indicates the need for a different approach.",2
889,"That approach consists of a code of good practice (The Highway Code), a requirement that drivers pass a qualifying test, and a network of offences to penalize those who deviate from proper standards.",2
890,"Leaving aside manslaughter and causing death by reckless driving, offences discussed in the previous chapter, the ladder of offences runs from reckless driving, through drunken driving and careless driving, down to various offences of failure to obey traffic signs and failure to maintain a vehicle in a roadworthy state.",2
891,"Reckless driving, section 2 of the Road Traffic Act 1972, is committed where D's driving creates an obvious and serious risk of causing physical injury to some other person or of doing substantial damage to property, and where D either saw the risk or failed to give any thought to the risk.",2
892,This is the test of and .,2
893,"The effect of restricting the offence to reckless driving, a restriction which was enacted in 1977 (previously it had included dangerous driving, a less demanding standard), has been that relatively few convictions for this offence are obtained.",2
894,"The offence immediately below is careless driving section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1972, which is committed by anyone who drives without due care and attention.",2
895,"This offence is punishable only with a fine, whereas reckless driving carries a maximum of two years' imprisonment.",2
896,The gap between the two offences is therefore considerable.,2
897,"The other major offence is drunken driving, an offence bristling with technicalities which carries a maximum prison sentence of six months' and a minimum period twelve months' disqualification from driving.",2
898,"This structure of serious road-traffic offences was recently examined by the North Committee, which came to the conclusion that the criminal law does not treat traffic offences with the gravity they deserve, given the potential consequences of any deviation from proper standards of driving.",2
899,"During the 1980s there was evidence of harsher  punishments being handed out to reckless drivers, and of a wider appreciation of the risks created and the misery inflicted by deviations from proper standards of driving.",2
900,"The North Committee recommended a reformulation of the offence of reckless driving to encompass ‘very bad driving’ of a wider kind, retaining careless driving as the lower offence.",2
901,"The essence of both offences would be the intrinsic quality of the driving and its deviation from the proper standard, not the consequences which happen to result or happen not to result in a particular case.",2
902,"However, the Committee did accept the relevance of resulting harm in one sphere, namely, in its proposal of a new offence of causing death by careless driving when over the alcohol limit.",2
903,This might be justified as a means of signalling the connection between drunken driving and fatal accidents.,2
904,"It is open to the obvious objection that it focuses on an outcome which may be a matter of pure chance: if such driving happens not to result in death, the charge will merely be drunken driving.",2
905,One reply to this is that most offences of bad driving have the potential to cause death or serious injury; and that the North Committee's proposals the element of endangerment where no harm occurs -value the resulting harm where it does occur.,2
906,The question of endangerment has already been raised in a more general fashion in Chapter 7.7.,2
907,"English criminal law contains a number of discrete offences of endangerment, created in particular circumstances to deal with particular problems.",2
908,", the road-traffic offences, there are offences under sections 32 and 33 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 of endangering railway passengers; there are the offences under section 1(2) of the Criminal Damage Act 1971 of endangering the lives of others by causing damage to property (usually by fire); the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 penalizes employers for failure to ensure that employees are not exposed to risks to their health or safety; and there are offences, that under section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987, of selling goods in contravention of safety regulations.",2
909,"These are all offences of endangerment, in the  sense that no harm need have resulted from the dangerous behaviour.",2
910,Their importance lies in the value of the interest in freedom from physical violation.,2
911,"However, they do not accord with traditional conceptions of crime — perhaps because many of the offences may be committed in ‘normal’, situations, driving a car or conducting a business — and this may tend to obscure their direct relation to the issue of physical safety.",2
912,It was argued in Chapter 2.5 and 2.6 that social attitudes towards various sources of harm are too hidebound by convention and ought to be re-examined.,2
913,Chapter 7.7 commended the approach of the American Model Penal Code in creating a general offence of endangerment.,2
914,"A different approach would be to introduce recklessness into the non-fatal offences of causing injury, labelling cases of endangerment in the same way as ‘traditional’ crimes.",2
915,This would only be effective if it were accompanied by changes in policing practice and prosecution policy.,2
916,"The advantage would be that the law would move closer towards proportionality based on degree of harm and degree of risk, untrammelled by conventional views of what does and what does not count as ‘crime’.",2
917,(k) The Structure of the Non-Fatal Offences,2
918,"This survey has shown that, generally speaking, the existing range of offences seems to emphasize the result, the degree of foresight and the status of the victim as the critical issues in grading crimes of physical violation.",2
919,"The crimes in the 1861 Act form a somewhat shakily constructed ladder, with rather more overlapping of offences and elements of constructive liability than is necessary.",2
920,"Factors which undoubtedly influence judgments of seriousness, the existence of provocation, or the difference between premeditated and impulsive violence, are accorded no legal significance and are left to the sentencing stage.",2
921,"The main exception to this concerns the status of the victim, with separate offences for assaults on police-officers and wilful neglect of children, .",2
922,How might the non-fatal offences be reformed to conform with the principle of fair labelling?,2
923,The approach recommended by  the Criminal Law Revision Committee illustrates the difficulties.,2
924,The Committee proposed three major offences in the field between attempted murder and common assault: causing serious injury with intent to cause serious injury; causing serious injury recklessly; and causing injury either with intent or recklessly.,2
925,"Separate offences for cases involving police-officers and children would be retained, to mark out the extra heinousness of such crimes .",2
926,"The scheme depends chiefly on the seriousness of the harm caused and the degree of foresight, though in a much more structured fashion than the 1861 Act.",2
927,There are three obvious difficulties.,2
928,"First, what is the meaning of ‘injury’?",2
929,"The only element specifically defined is that it includes unconsciousness; otherwise, its definition remains vague.",2
930,Second what is the distinction between injury and serious injury?,2
931,", it is left to the courts to draw the line their overall judgment of the facts.",2
932,"These are two respects in which the reformed law would not achieve maximum certainty, and those who argue that the terms would ‘cause little problem of interpretation’ are surely giving way to unwarranted optimism.",2
933,"Third, why are there two separate offences of causing serious injury — with intent, or recklessly — when the two mental states are combined in a single offence for mere injury?",2
934,"The Committee's view was that there is ‘a definite moral and psychological difference’ between causing serious injury with intent and causing serious injury recklessly, and that this difference should be reflected in separate offences.",2
935,"However, since it is ‘not an easy distinction for the police, magistrates and juries to have to make’, no attempt should be made to draw such a legal distinction at the lower level of ‘injury’ offences.",2
936,"to support this position, one has to accept:(i) that the intention — recklessness distinction is the most significant dividing line for serious injuries, more relevant than factors premeditation or provocation;(ii) that this is a workable distinction for the courts, especially in impulsive crimes, where the definition of intention may be fulfilled by a momentary realization of what is happening;(iii) that it is so significant that a difference in maximum penalties between life imprisonment and five years' imprisonment is appropriate; and (iv) that there is not a strong case for phrasing the  offences endangerment of causing physical harm.",2
937,"The Committee's proposals are a distinct improvement on the anomalies of the 1861 Act, but they leave these four issues open to doubt.",2
938,8.4 REPORTED SEXUAL ASSAULTS,2
939,The kinds of sexual assault reported to the police cover an enormous range of conduct.,2
940,"Among the most serious are those now defined as rape (sexual intercourse without consent), and about one-sixth of these cases involve the perpetration of further sexual indignities upon the victim.",2
941,"Reported rapes have increased considerably in the 1980s, but it is difficult to tell to what extent this represents a real increase in the number of rapes or an increase in the reporting of them.",2
942,"The approach of the police to the investigation of rape cases has been much criticism — and then to considerable improvement — and it seems quite possible that these improvements, together with the advent of rape-crisis centres and victim-support facilities, have led more women to report rapes than did so formerly.",2
943,"Reporting a rape remains a strenuous and harrowing experience, however, and it is likely to continue as an underreported offence.",2
944,"Another serious offence is buggery (intercourse per anum), but that constitutes a crime whether committed consensually or non-consensually, and it is the non-consensual form which ranks as a serious sexual assault.",2
945,"Many of the other forms of sexual assault on males or females do not take the form of sexual intercourse as defined in the offences of rape and buggery, and English law classifies these as indecent assaults.",2
946,"This offence, with a maximum penalty of ten years' imprisonment, covers a wide range of conduct, from a stolen kiss on the cheek to forced fellatio (oral sex).",2
947,"Then there is a group of offences which prohibit sexual activities with young people, whether they appear to consent or not: whilst there is little dispute about the need for some such offences, there is room for disagreement on the proper boundaries of the criminal law and on the role of prosecutorial discretion.",2
948,"The offence of incest prohibits certain sexual relations within the family, thus providing a distinct label for some forms of child sexual abuse by  parents and grandparents, although it also covers brother — sister relationships.",2
949,"Before we consider each of these offences in outline, let us examine the practical and theoretical foundations for them.",2
950,The practical effects of sexual assault can be considerable.,2
951,"There are well-documented consequences of rape victimization: some authorities write of a ‘rape trauma syndrome’, signifying deep disruption of the victim's life-pattern and thought-processes not just the physical effects of rape (physical pain, inability to sleep, prolonged distress), but also the effects on well-being (new-found fears, mistrust of surroundings and other people, embarrassment, ).",2
952,Young's New Zealand report concludes that ‘rape is an experience which shakes the foundations of the lives of the victims.,2
953,"For many its effect is a long-term one, impairing their capacity for personal relationships, altering their behaviour and values and generating fear.’",2
954,"There is no reason to suppose that such effects are confined to the victims of rape as traditionally defined: although sexual assaults vary in their degree, there may be many other forms of sexual assault which are serious enough to create such profound physical and psychological after-effects.",2
955,"What, then, are the interests typically threatened or destroyed by sexual assaults?",2
956,They may be described generally sexual autonomy and sexual choice.,2
957,"The argument must begin from the proposition that our body is our own: it is our private zone, and respect for privacy and personal autonomy both support this.",2
958,"Since these values are high among those which the criminal law ought to respect, no further demonstration of this starting-point is necessary.",2
959,"Each citizen may be said to have the right not to have sexual choices imposed on him or her; whether the law should go further, and hold that each citizen has the right to pursue his or her sexual choices consensually with another (public-decency laws and to the protection of the young), is a question to be considered separately.",2
960,Is respect for sexual choice any more important than respect for another's property rights?,2
961,The answer to this requires us to assess the relative centrality of sexual choice to life choices and living standards.,2
962,"It may be argued that sexuality has a certain uniqueness which is absent from much property: sexuality is an intrinsic part of one's personality, it is a mode of expressing that personality others, and it is therefore fundamental that one should  be able to choose whether to express oneself in this way — and, if so, towards and with whom.",2
963,The essence of such self-expression is that it should be voluntary.,2
964,"Thus, even where a sexual assault involves no significant physical force, it constitutes harm in the sense that it invades a deeply personal zone, gaining non-consensually that which should only be shared consensually.",2
965,"this formulation of ‘taking without permission’ sounds too close to an analogy with theft, it must be emphasized that the crucial element in sexual assault resides in the close interrelationship between the body and the personality.",2
966,"This close relationship, some would say identity, emphasizes that central values autonomy and privacy are bound up in all sexual cases.",2
967,"It is the threat to these values which brings the real, deep, and sometimes long-lasting effects of sexual assault.",2
968,"There can therefore be little doubt that, , sexual assaults constitute a substantially more serious form of harm than mere property offences — which is not to deny that some forms of theft or destruction of property can be more serious than some minor sexual assaults.",2
969,"There is much to suggest that the attitudes of society towards sexual offences, particularly the attitudes of many men (who hold most of the leading posts in the making of policy and law), have tended to undervalue the seriousness of sexual assaults.",2
970,"Among the manifestations of these attitudes are the statements of some defendants in rape trials, which may show an indifference towards the wishes of women, or a belief that the wearing of attractive clothes or an invitation to coffee is a sure sign of willingness to engage in sex; and the attitudes of some police-officers in the early 1980s, influenced by any one of a number of assumptions about the prevalence of false complaints of rape, about the ‘typical’ rape as an attack by a stranger, about the presence of injuries or bruises in ‘genuine’rapes, .",2
971,Recent years have seen a growing awareness that most of these assumptions about rape are myths.,2
972,"The police have improved both their procedures and their training, but it is not known whether social attitudes have changed greatly.",2
973,"Studies of rape in England and Wales suggest that two-thirds of rapes take place in the home of the victim or the offender, and that only one-third involve strangers; that two-fifths of victims suffer physical violence rape, and one-sixth suffer additional  sexual indignities; that recent years have seen an increase in the reporting of rapes between acquaintances, and that rapes are increasing in their intrinsic seriousness (i.e. the violence used, other sexual acts, etc), but that the most significant rise has been in the average length of sentences imposed on rapists by the courts.",2
974,"Longer sentences may be applauded by some, but it is doubtful whether they will make any significant contribution to the protection of women.",2
975,"A recent Home Office survey concludes that there is no simple solution to the prevention of rape, ‘the willingness both to question and to change the pattern of social life’.",2
976,"The argument is that serious sexual assaults, and the attitude of many men towards them, derive from a male-dominated approach to sexuality in which aggressive sexual behaviour by males is praised or condoned whilst women are associated with passivity.",2
977,"To alter this cluster of attitudes to one in which sexuality is seen as an expression of an equal, sharing relationship will require a widespread change in social attitudes through education and other media.",2
978,8.5 NON-CONSENSUAL SEXUAL INTERCOURSE,2
979,"The structure of sexual offences in English criminal law places rape and buggery at the top of the ‘ladder’, each carrying a maximum of life imprisonment, with the offences of attempted rape (maximum penalty of life imprisonment) and indecent assault (maximum penalty of ten years) beneath them.",2
980,"The conduct which constitutes rape is unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman without her consent; the fault element required is that the man intends to have sexual intercourse, and either knows that the woman is not consenting or ‘could not care less’ whether she is not consenting.",2
981,A number of issues arise for discussion.,2
982,(a) The concept of ‘Sexual Intercourse’,2
983,Rape is only committed where the man has sexual intercourse with the woman without her consent.,2
984,"Sexual intercourse is defined as the penetration of the penis into the vagina: ejaculation is not required, and the offence is committed penetration takes place, although it has been held that the offence continues throughout penetration (if the woman revokes her consent during intercourse and the man fails to withdraw, he commits rape).",2
985,"Is English law right to define rape in this way, and thereby to exclude from this offence such conduct as forced oral sex (fellatio), cunnilingus, and buggery?",2
986,"It can be argued that these offences may be no less traumatic for the victim than ‘conventional’ rape, and therefore that any attempt to classify sexual offences by reference to their seriousness should place these forms of sexual assault in the highest category.",2
987,"In its review of sexual offences the Criminal Law Revision Committee argued preserving the existing classification, on the basis that rape has a settled popular meaning and that the distinguishing feature of ‘conventional’ rape is the risk of pregnancy.",2
988,"However, the latter point fails to take account of the fact that rape is committed there is no ejaculation, and the woman is infertile, and it has been strongly argued that ‘penetration involving the penis, vagina or anus is perceived differently and regarded more seriously than other forms of penetration’.",2
989,"It may therefore be questioned whether English law takes the right approach in confining its most serious sexual offence, rape, so narrowly.",2
990,(b) Marital Rape,2
991,"Rape is only held to have been committed in English law where the sexual intercourse is ‘unlawful’, and it is generally assumed that the function of that term is to remove non-consensual intercourse between a man and his wife from the ambit of rape.",2
992,"If the man uses force or inflicts emotional shock on his wife to obtain sex, he is liable to conviction for assault occasioning actual bodily harm or some other offence against the person.",2
993,"But if he obtains his wife's submission to intercourse without resort to those means, there is no offence.",2
994,"The origins of this marital-rape exemption seem to lie in the notion that the wife is the husband's property, or that the wife promises intercourse on demand, but it has been defended in modern times on the basis that such cases raise essentially family matters, better suited to examination in a non-criminal court, and that in any case proof would be difficult.",2
995,"However, it is questionable whether the doors of the family home should be closed to the criminal law when so many offences of wife-battering, child battering, and sexual abuse of wives and children seem to go on behind them.",2
996,Are persons who inflict physical or sexual assault in the domestic context really less blameworthy than their counterparts on the street?,2
997,Are victims within the family any less worthy of the protection of the criminal law?,2
998,Should the criminal law really distinguish between unmarried and married couples when it comes to dealing with rape?,2
999,It is perhaps in recognition of the awkward position of English law that exceptions have been made to the marital-rape exemption in recent years.,2
1000,"Where the court is able to conclude that the wife's ‘implied consent to marital intercourse’ has been formally revoked, non-consensual intercourse by the husband amounts to rape.",2
1001,"This may be the case where there has been a separation order, a decree nisi for divorce, a non-molestation order, or a separation agreement between the parties.",2
1002,"However, these particular instances do not meet the general proposition that if the husband and wife have drifted apart, and the woman has made it known that she wants to have sex with her husband, it is wrong that the husband who has sex with her without her consent is exempt from conviction for rape.",2
1003,"There may be many reasons why the husband and wife do not make any formal agreement about separation, but this should not entitle a husband to return and force himself upon his wife weeks, months, or even years since he last saw her.",2
1004,"The inadequacy of this part of English law was signalled recently in (1988), where the Court of Appeal upheld an estranged husband's conviction for indecently assaulting his wife by forcing her to have oral sex with him.",2
1005,"The defence argument was that this  was a preliminary to ‘conventional’ intercourse, and that if the husband was exempt from liability for rape, he should equally be exempt from liability for indecent assault.",2
1006,The Court held that marriage does not imply consent to fellatio.,2
1007,This decision goes a long way towards demonstrating the untenability of the marital-rape exemption in modern times.,2
1008,"The Law Commission has now proposed the abolition of the marital-rape exemption, bringing English law into accord with the many other jurisdictions where it does constitute rape for a husband to have non-consensual sexual intercourse with his wife.",2
1009,"Reported cases are small in number, and it may be true that in some (not all) of these cases the degree of trauma suffered by the wife is less than if the rape had been by another man; but abolition of the marital-rape exemption is surely important as a statement of the married woman's autonomy and freedom of choice in sexual matters.",2
1010,"These fundamental values should not be jettisoned simply because marriage is a factor in the case, as indeed the Court of Appeal affirmed when holding that a husband may be convicted of kidnapping his wife.",2
1011,(c) Mistaken Belief in Consent,2
1012,The fault element in rape is that the man knows that the woman is not consenting or ‘could not care less’ that she is not consenting.,2
1013,"It would seem to follow from this that a man who that the woman is consenting, she is not, ought to be acquitted.",2
1014,"Lord Hailsham, in the leading decision of (16) held that this follows as a matter of ‘inexorable logic’.",2
1015,"It is not, then, a question of deciding on the elements of a ‘defence’ of mistake, because, where the man is mistaken, this means that he quite simply lacks the fault element required for the offence.",2
1016,It is not a ‘defence’ the negation of the elements of the crime.,2
1017,"So where, as in , defendants claim that they believed the woman was consenting, because her husband (who was present) had told them that she enjoyed a struggle, their case is simply that they lacked the fault element required for the crime.",2
1018,"The decision in has been hailed as a turning-point in English criminal law, the House of Lords resoundingly  affirmed the subjective principle of guilt.",2
1019,Fairness requires that we judge a defendant on the facts .,2
1020,"Previous decisions had held that a mistake must be based on reasonable grounds if it is to excuse, a doctrine which is illogical for the reason given by Lord Hailsham.",2
1021,"Where a crime requires knowledge or recklessness a certain circumstance, and the defendant holds a mistaken belief about that circumstance, logic demands that an acquittal should follow.",2
1022,"Moreover, the supporters of add, this should not lead to unmeritorious acquittals, because juries will not allow bogus defences to succeed: in itself the House of Lords was satisfied that the basis for the defence was so weak that a correctly directed jury would have found the defendants guilty.",2
1023,"However, it is possible to concede that defendants should be judged on the facts as they believe them to be, and yet to argue an exception in rape cases.",2
1024,"This would be a bold argument, since its thrust would be that is correct as a case on general principles but wrong as a rape decision.",2
1025,How might the argument run?,2
1026,One could argue that there are certain situations in which the risk of serious harm is so obvious that it would be right for the law to impose a duty to take care to ascertain the facts before proceeding.,2
1027,"In other words, mistakes must be based on reasonable grounds where the offences are serious — which would cover not only rape but also cases involving a risk of death or serious injury, the use of force in self-defence.",2
1028,"One drawback of this style of argument is that not only is the harm serious for the victim, but conviction for such an offence is serious for the defendant: a single class of offenders (rapists, serious wounders) would contain not only those with subjective fault but also those who merely failed to take proper care, all of whom would be convict.ed of a grave offence carrying a maximum of life imprisonment.",2
1029,"Perhaps a more fruitful line of argument is to emphasize that not only is rape a serious matter for the victim, but the ascertainment of one vital fact — consent — is a relatively easy matter for the man.",2
1030,"There is a clear contrast here between cases of the use of serious force in self-defence, where there may be a need to act instantaneously on a hastily formed view of the situation, and sexual intercourse with another, where consent or non-consent is the essence of the crime and can be ascertained by asking a plain question of the victim.",2
1031,Thus the argument is that the victim's right to autonomy and freedom of sexual choice does not need to yield to the principle that a defendant should be judged on the facts as he believes them to be; it would be so simple (the inevitable physical proximity of the man and woman) for the man to ascertain the facts here.,2
1032,", this involves a departure from the general subjective principle of criminal liability, since it involves imposing a duty on the defendant to ask about the victim's consent before continuing with his conduct.",2
1033,"But compared with the potential sacrifice of victims' rights, this duty is so undemanding that the arguments in its favour are powerful.",2
1034,"Critics will say that it converts rape into an offence of negligence, in one respect .",2
1035,"The answer is that it does, and that the justifications for doing so have been set out above — not so much because rape is a serious offence, but rather because ascertainment of the facts is so easy that there should be little substantive unfairness to defendants.",2
1036,"If the criminal law is to impose further duties on citizens, it is important to take account of the legality principles, particularly the principle of maximum certainty (see Chapter 3.3 (i) and (g)).",2
1037,This brings the discussion back to whether changes in social attitudes are the most effective way of preventing sexual victimization.,2
1038,"There is no shortage of examples of defendants in rape cases who assumed that a woman who said no really meant yes, or who inferred from other supposed clues (make-up, clothing, accepting a drink) that the victim had consented, despite her apparent protests.",2
1039,"Changing the law on mistake in rape could help to change these social attitudes, for some time to come defendants might find themselves charged with rape such ingrained attitudes towards women.",2
1040,(d) Reckless Rapes,2
1041,One of the many reactions to the decision of the House of Lords in (1982) was that it went against ,2
1042,and cut down its ambit.,2
1043,"In fact, although the two decisions are opposed in spirit, their practical spheres of operation can be separated.",2
1044,"For one thing,deals with cases where D has either recognized the risk or has failed to give any thought to it, whereas applies only where D has formed a distinct belief that the victim is consenting, a situation not explicitly covered by .",2
1045,"It may also be said that is concerned with foresight of consequences, whereas is concerned with knowledge of circumstances.",2
1046,"It is doubtful whether either of these distinctions would bear scrutiny  on the broader canvas of moral and social philosophy: the moral thrust of is that people are often just as much to blame for to think as they are for thinking about their actions and its consequences, and this very argument was applied to rape in the paragraphs above.",2
1047,"In fact, the definition of recklessness has not been followed in rape cases, that offence would seem to fulfil the criterion of being a modern statute in which the term ‘reckless’ is used.",2
1048,"The Court of Appeal's decisions have wavered somewhat, but the test which they now favour is that D is reckless if he ‘could not care less’ whether the woman is not consenting.",2
1049,"This test is ambiguous D must have thought about whether the woman is consenting, but there are those who argue that one cannot be said ‘not to care less’ about something unless one has considered it.",2
1050,"There are arguments here, as there are mistake, that the law should impose a duty on men to consider consent, and therefore should treat them as reckless if they have failed to give any thought to the matter.",2
1051,Plausible cases are likely to be extremely rare in practice.,2
1052,"(e) Fraud, Deception, and Consent",2
1053,How should the law deal with cases where the woman's consent to sexual intercourse stemmed from a mistake on her part?,2
1054,"English law has tended to confine narrowly the situations in which a mistake is held to negative the consent apparently given by the woman: only where the victim was made to believe that the man was her husband, or that the act to which she was being asked to consent was not sexual intercourse, is the mistake sufficiently fundamental to convert the apparently consensual sex into rape.",2
1055,"The latter question has arisen where young girls have been invited to submit to acts to train their voice or to improve their breathing — unbeknown to them, the act which they were permitting was sexual intercourse.",2
1056,"Other types of fraud and mistake are held to be insufficient for the offence of rape, and bring the case within the lesser offence of procuring a woman by false pretences or false representations to have unlawful sexual intercourse (section 3, Sexual Offences Act 1956, carrying a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment).",2
1057,Does the existing dividing line reflect the relative seriousness of  these mistake-related offences?,2
1058,"Since the identity of one's sexual partner may be assumed to be of fundamental significance, it is surely unjustified to give effect to this only where the mistake concerns whether the man is the woman's husband?",2
1059,"But there are wider issues here, too, implicit in the promiscuous use of the words ‘mistake’, ‘false representations’, ‘fraud’, .",2
1060,"Analogies with the effect of mistake in the law of contract may appear obvious, but it is questionable whether they are appropriate.",2
1061,The issues are: when the defendant should be convicted of a crime; how the crime should be labelled; and how seriously it should be viewed.,2
1062,"It could be argued, therefore, that the focus should not be the victim's mental state but the defendant's intentions.",2
1063,"If D set out to trick V into having sex, realising that she probably would not consent otherwise, are not his intention and his method sufficient to condemn him for rape, as they would be for obtaining property by deception?",2
1064,"Similarly, if D knowingly takes advantage of the fact that V is labouring under a mistaken belief to have sex with her, when (as he realises) she probably would not consent otherwise, should this not be sufficient?",2
1065,"The answer to those questions may be said to depend on whether it is generally as serious to obtain sex by deception as it is by other means (threats, force, fear).",2
1066,"In England the Criminal Law Revision Committee took the view that it is not, and therefore supported the division between fundamental deceptions (identity or the nature of the act) and lesser deceptions, placing the latter within the less serious category of procuring sex by deception.",2
1067,"this view, the woman who agrees to have sex with D only when he promises to marry her (never intending to keep this promise)— and because he has promised to marry her — is a victim not of rape but of the lesser offence of procuring sexual intercourse by false representations.",2
1068,"The Committee proposed to raise the maximum penalty for this offence to five years, but limited its recommendation to cases where D actively deceives V and failed to make any provision for cases where D takes advantage of a known mistake.",2
1069,"(f) Threats, Fear and Consent",2
1070,"More frequent in practice, and more problematic, are the cases involving threats and fear.",2
1071,"At one time it was the law that rape is  committed only where the woman submits through force, fear, or fraud.",2
1072,"This is a requirement, because decisions in the nineteenth century made it clear that rape can be committed whenever the woman does not consent — is asleep, , or too drunk to consent.",2
1073,"However, there are both practical and legal problems in cases where the woman says that she consented through fear only: she did not resist, because she thought that it would be hopeless in the circumstances, she was terrified, or she feared serious violence.",2
1074,"The practical problems are that there may be no evidence of violence on the woman's body, which usually means that the case will be a question of the victim's word against the defendant's; this may lead the police to be sceptical of the woman's complaint, or may incline the prosecutor to accept a plea of guilty to the lesser charge of indecent assault.",2
1075,"The legal problems are similar to those in the cases of mistake and deception: are all threats serious enough to justify regarding the crime as a rape, or should some threats be accommodated within a lesser offence?",2
1076,"English law has the lesser crime of procuring unlawful sexual intercourse by threats or intimidation, and appears to limit rape to those cases where there is a threat of violence.",2
1077,"However, there is a wider dimension to the question, which encompasses fear threats, and this hinges on the distinction between submission and consent.",2
1078,In the case of (1981) two girls were picked up by two men and taken to a remote house.,2
1079,The victim was already distressed after being raped by the other man when D announced his intention to have sex with her.,2
1080,"She asked him why he could not leave her alone, what the other man had already done to her, but he turned off the lights and told her to undress.",2
1081,She did not resist.,2
1082,The Court of Appeal rejected the defence argument that there must be actual violence or threats of violence for the offence to be classified as rape.,2
1083,It also rejected the Crown's argument that the issue of consent should be left to the jury — in the same way as the question of dishonesty is left to them in theft cases — but its actual decision comes fairly close to this position.,2
1084,"Thus, the jury should be instructed that the term ‘consent’ covers a whole range of situations from actual desire to reluctant acquiescence, and that the dividing line between real consent and mere submission must be drawn by the jury by applying its knowledge of human nature to the facts of the case.",2
1085,"The law of rape may therefore extend to threats threats of violence, but its boundaries are most uncertain.",2
1086,"Resort to such concepts as ‘common sense’ and ‘knowledge of human nature’, is little more than a veiled admission that no satisfactory criteria have been found.",2
1087,"The narrowest position is to say that rape is committed only where D threatens violence or knows that V is in fear of violence, and that any other threat must fall within the lesser offence of procuring sex by threats.",2
1088,"A broad position would be to hold that any threat may negative consent, and this might include a threat to send a compromising photograph to someone, a threat to report a driver for exceeding the speed limit, .",2
1089,"Among intermediate positions, one possibility is to draw an analogy with the offence of blackmail, holding that any unwarranted demand for sex with menaces should amount to rape, the menaces being either sufficient to influence an ordinary person or sufficient to influence the mind of this victim.",2
1090,"But the difficulty with this discussion is that it lacks a firm point of reference because it cannot be taken for granted that there should be two levels of offence, rape and procuring sex by threats.",2
1091,"If there is to be a single offence of serious sexual assault, there are arguments for including all cases of obtaining sex by fear or threats within that.",2
1092,"If the present division is regarded as desirable, the next step is to ensure that the maximum penalty for the lesser offence is sufficient to deal with cases of serious threats which are not enough to negative consent in rape.",2
1093,"Then one can address the question of whether rape should be confined to cases where submission arises from a threat or fear of violence, or whether it should be phrased more widely.",2
1094,"At that stage, questions about the appropriateness of labels, sentencing powers, and the principle of legality (certainty requirements) come to the fore.",2
1095,These questions will be considered on a broader canvas in section 8.7 below.,2
1096,8.6 OTHER NON-CONSENSUAL SEXUAL OFFENCES,2
1097,"So far the discussion has focused on the offence of rape in English law, which is confined to cases of ‘sexual intercourse’ where the penis penetrates the vagina.",2
1098,"Other kinds of sexual assault are classified in English law as buggery, attempted buggery or rape, or  indecent assault, and there are also offences against young people and the mentally disordered.",2
1099,These will be considered briefly before the general subject of sexual offences is re-examined.,2
1100,(a) Buggery,2
1101,"One of the circumstances constituting this offence is where the penis penetrate the anus of a male or a female, and the maximum penalty is life imprisonment.",2
1102,"The law therefore allows the offence to be treated just as seriously as rape, and we have seen how some would argue that it should be included as a form of rape, or as a form of the most serious offence of sexual assault, in any reformed law.",2
1103,"In ordinary parlance one might say that anyone who has been forcibly subjected to this offence has been raped; the psychological effects are likely to be deep, and there is no risk of pregnancy (as there is not from some rapes, since ejaculation is not part of the definition), there may be the risk of disease.",2
1104,(b) Attempted Rape or Attempted Buggery,2
1105,"If a defendant fulfils the requirements for the offence of rape or buggery but failed to achieve penetration, liability for attempted rape or attempted buggery may be possible.",2
1106,"These are serious offences, carrying the same maximum penalty as the full offences.",2
1107,A survey in the 1970s showed that almost one-third of rape charges resulted in conviction of attempted rape.,2
1108,"the law of attempts, the least that a defendant must be proved to have done is something ‘more than merely preparatory’ to sexual intercourse, with intent to have unlawful sexual intercourse without the woman's consent.",2
1109,Whether the prosecution can prove attempted rape the lesser offence of indecent assault will often depend on proof of the defendant's intention to go beyond the indecent acts already committed.,2
1110,"A legal problem has arisen here defendants who ‘could not care less’ whether the woman was not consenting: we have seen that such men can be convicted of rape in cases where they achieve penetration, but there is a problem in convicting them of attempted rape where they fail to achieve penetration but clearly intended to do so.",2
1111,The problem is that  conviction for an attempted crime requires an intent to commit the full offence whereas the ‘reckless’ attempted rapist intends to have sexual intercourse but is merely reckless the woman's non-consent.,2
1112,"The strong argument classifying such offences as attempted rape merely indecent assault has now been recognized by the Law Commission's draft Criminal Code, and the Court of Appeal has recently found its way to this conclusion by ‘interpreting’ the Criminal Attempts Act 1981.",2
1113,(c) Indecent Assault,2
1114,"In English law the offence of indecent assault is charged for all forms of sexual assault rape, buggery, and attempts to commit those crimes.",2
1115,"Until 1985 the maximum penalty for indecent assault on a female was two years' imprisonment, compared with ten years for indecent assault on a male — a legacy of the horror with which homosexuality was viewed, and of the undervaluing of female sexual and physical autonomy — but the maximum penalty for both forms of indecent assault is now ten years.",2
1116,"This is a far more realistic maximum for cases involving forced oral sex and other indignities, but the real question is whether such serious forms of sexual assault should be classified differently.",2
1117,"they ‘share’ the offence of indecent assault with many minor forms of misconduct, giving an unwanted kiss or fondling clothes being worn by someone else, for which the penalty is likely to be a long way down the scale.",2
1118,"This suggests that there is a strong argument for having two grades of indecent assault in English law, or for moving some of the more serious forms of the crime (forced fellatio or cunnilingus) into a broadened crime of rape or ‘serious sexual assault’.",2
1119,"Most of the technical legal controversy has concerned not the more serious varieties of indecent assault but the more ambiguous forms, where the element of indecency is used to separate the sexual offence from the non-sexual.",2
1120,In (1988) the House of Lords upheld the conviction of a man who had spanked a young girl several times on the seat of her shorts.,2
1121,"The House distinguished, in effect, three types of case.",2
1122,"First, where the conduct would not be thought indecent by any right-minded observer, indecent assault  could not be committed.",2
1123,"Second, where right-minded observers would agree that the conduct was indecent, that would be an indecent assault.",2
1124,"In a third class of cases, where the right-minded observer would be unsure, the court would look at the defendant's motive and, only if that was indecent, would the offence be made out.",2
1125,"One result of this is that much will turn on the court's initial characterization of the incident, using the ‘right-minded person’ test.",2
1126,"That test is vague, but could it be improved upon in this context?",2
1127,Is it possible to predetermine the types of conduct regarded as indecent?,2
1128,"Should the defendant's motive be so crucial in cases where the act is not obviously indecent, in the sense that ‘right-minded persons’ would not unhesitatingly classify it as such?",2
1129,"(One might argue against the concept of ‘right-minded persons’, which moves a statistical concept ‘most people’ or ‘the ordinary citizen’and seems to seek a moral plane which is ‘right-minded’, a question-begging approach in this context.)",2
1130,Does it matter if a person derives some kind of sexual satisfaction from an act which most people or ‘right-minded persons’ would not regard as indecent?,2
1131,"There is no parallel here with punishment for attempts and other inchoate offences, because there is no proof that the defendant was aiming to do something harmful: the harmfulness of the action is supposedly constituted by the indecent motive, not by anything actually done, or about to be done, to the victim.",2
1132,The two main issues in the crime of indecent assault are therefore: whether the crime ought to be divided into two grades the more serious forms of sexual assault can be labelled separately; and how to draw the line between indecent and non-indecent contact with another.,2
1133,"There is no indecent assault where the other party consents to the conduct, and the fault element for the crime includes knowledge or recklessness whether the other party is consenting.",2
1134,"Here, as with rape, it seems sufficient to show that D ‘could not care less’ whether the other party was not consenting.",2
1135,"However, a person under the age of 16 cannot give valid consent.",2
1136,"Thus, if a woman were to have sexual intercourse with a boy under 16, this would be the offence of indecent assault by the woman the boy consented to, or instigated, the act.",2
1137,"This restriction on consent is designed for the protection of the young, to which we will now turn.",2
1138,(d) Sexual Intercourse with Girls under 16,2
1139,A male commits an offence if he has sexual intercourse with a girl under 16.,2
1140,"she consents in fact, this has no effect in law and the offence is still committed.",2
1141,"If the girl is under 13, the maximum penalty is life imprisonment, since a girl of 12 or under cannot have sufficient knowledge of the consequences of sex, or sufficient maturity of judgment to take decisions on those consequences.",2
1142,"Where the girl is aged 13 to 15, the maximum penalty is two years.",2
1143,There is a defence for a young man under 24 who has not previously been charged with a similar offence and who believes that the girl is 16 years old.,2
1144,"In practice, the vast majority of reported offences of unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl of 16 involve young men of a similar age or a few years older, and the general trend is to administer a formal caution to such persons to prosecute them.",2
1145,"Prosecution is thus reserved for the cases in which some unfair advantage has been taken of the girl, particularly where the girl is under 13 (when lack of proper understanding is assumed), where the man is considerably older than the girl, where the man held some position of trust the girl, and where there is some element of deception involved.",2
1146,The law does not specify any of these elements: everything is left to prosecutorial discretion.,2
1147,"The Criminal Law Revision Committee took the view that, if the law did try to restrict the offence in this way, it would inevitably legalize some cases which should remain the law.",2
1148,Thus the law continues to sacrifice the principle of maximum certainty (see Chapter 3.3 (i)) to the supposed dictates of practicality.,2
1149,"The law is framed widely, in the expectation that it will be enforced selectively.",2
1150,"In one particular sphere, however, other legal systems seem to disagree with the practicality argument: namely, cases of sexual intercourse with a girl under 16 committed by a person in a position of trust towards her.",2
1151,"Many countries have an offence of ‘abuse of authority’ to differentiate these crimes, the principle of fair labelling (Chapter 3.3 (1)), but anxieties about the problem of listing the types of authority (should it include persons undertaking voluntary responsibility, choirmasters and youth-club leaders?) have led to the continuation of the pragmatic all-encompassing provisions in England and Wales.",2
1152,There are sharp divisions about the fault element for the offence of unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under 16.,2
1153,"The limited ‘defence’ of mistake about the girl's age, available to young men under 24, was explained above, and the reason for creating such a limited ‘defence’is that it has been held that the crime does not require any fault element the girl's age.",2
1154,"For many years the decision in (1875), in effect that the man is strictly liable when the girl is under 16, has been paraded by academic lawyers as the acme of injustice.",2
1155,"The decision may certainly be said to be the recent trend, that a defendant should be judged on the facts as he believes them to be; and this led the Criminal Law Revision Committee to recommend that the rules should be harmonized and that the prosecution should prove that the man realized that the girl was under 16.",2
1156,", one must question whether consistency is the highest value here.",2
1157,"Critics argue that the whole point of this offence is to provide protection for young girls, and that this will be undermined if it is open to men to seek an acquittal on the ground that the girl looked 16.",2
1158,"Without directly embracing the ‘protection’ element in this argument, it can be suggested that there should he a duty on the man to ask the girl about her age before entering into sexual relations, the answers may be untruthful in some cases.",2
1159,(e) Other Rules against Exploitation of the Vulnerable,2
1160,Mention might be made of four other special rules relating to the involvement of vulnerable persons in sexual activity.,2
1161,"The rule of strict liability age, which applies equally to indecent assault, has already been noticed.",2
1162,"Another judge-made rule is that in (1894), which provides that a person cannot be convicted as a party to an offence if the offence was created for the protection of such persons.",2
1163,"Thus, in cases where a young girl or young boy of 15 leads an adult into sexual activity, the youth cannot be convicted as a party to either unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under 16 or indecent assault (as the case may be).",2
1164,The adult commits the offence; the law imposes on him or her the duty to resist whatever temptation is provided by the under-age person.,2
1165,"Among the specific offences designed to protect the vulnerable, there are various offences of sexual relations with mentally handicapped persons.",2
1166,"There is a crime of gross indecency with or towards a child under 14, which may be committed there is no indecent assault on the child by the adult — by inviting the child to touch the genitalia of the adult, .",2
1167,"However, there seems little reason for limiting the offence to cases involving children under 14 when the general age of consent to sexual activity stands at 16.",2
1168,And it is an offence for a man to commit gross indecency with another man: this offence usually concerns mutual masturbation or oral sex between two males (there is no equivalent offence between females).,2
1169,"The reason for discussing it here is that, under the Sexual Offences Act 1967, this offence is not committed where the act is done , between consenting males, both aged 21 or over.",2
1170,This means that it is regarded as criminal for a man of 21 to commit this offence with a consenting male under 21.,2
1171,"The age of 21 seems exceptionally high, since a person has the right to vote at 18 and the age of consent for other sexual conduct is 16.",2
1172,"Logic suggests that 16 should be the age of consent for this conduct, too, but the CLRC took the view that young men of 16 and 17 need protection from this kind of behaviour, whereas they do not from other kinds of sexual contact.",2
1173,"The anomaly is increased by the fact that, under the present law, two young men under 21 who consensually commit ‘gross indecency’ are both liable to conviction for the offence: the rule in is inapplicable here, but the maximum penalty is two years' imprisonment where the offender is under 21, compared with five years where he is over 21.",2
1174,8.7 INCEST,2
1175,"A parent or grandparent who has sexual contact with a child or grandchild may well be guilty of one of the offences already considered — rape, if there is sexual intercourse without consent; indecent assault, if there is sexual contact with a child under 16; and even gross indecency with or towards a child, if the child is under 14.",2
1176,"These other offences do not cover all eventualities, and, moreover, it may be argued with some force that child sexual abuse at home  ought to be labelled separately.",2
1177,"It is not merely a sexual offence, but one of the deepest breaches of trust which can take place in a family-based society.",2
1178,"The home ought to be a safe haven, the place where people go to get fear and violence, and it is this fundamental feeling of safety which can be destroyed by child sexual abuse.",2
1179,Incest was introduced into English law as a distinct offence by the Punishment of Incest Act 1908.,2
1180,"Although the eugenic risk (that the child of an incestuous relationship between father — daughter or brother — sister will have congenital defects) was known at the time and was probably a factor, most of the arguments of the reformers were based on the protection of children from sexual exploitation.",2
1181,"Those arguments have great force today, as increasing evidence of child sexual abuse within the family comes to that power to lead a daughter into sexual activity from a relatively early age.",2
1182,"All kinds of pressure may be exerted on the child to keep quiet about the behaviour, with sometimes disastrous effects on his or her emotional development.",2
1183,"Indeed, the primacy of this anti-exploitation rationale over eugenic reasons makes it desirable to extend the offence to cover adopted children blood-relationships.",2
1184,"The offence of incest is committed by a man who has sexual intercourse with a person whom he knows to be his granddaughter, daughter, sister or mother, and by a woman aged 16 or over who permits her grandfather, father, brother, or son to have sexual intercourse with her.",2
1185,"The first thing to notice about this definition is that, like the offence of rape, it is restricted to ‘sexual intercourse’.",2
1186,"In the context of incest this is even less defensible — first, because eugenic reasons provide the main grounds for criminalization; and second because the primary rationale of punishing the sexual exploitation of children within the family applies no less to other serious sexual behaviour, oral and anal sex.",2
1187,Surely the offence of incest should cover all cases of vaginal or anal penetration or penetration involving the penis.,2
1188,Another feature of the offence is that it applies the ages of the parties (a woman cannot commit the offence of ‘permitting’ intercourse unless she is aged 16 or over).,2
1189,"Thus the crime of incest covers sexual relations by mature adults, in situations where the rationale of punishing exploitation of the young should apply.",2
1190,"One question, therefore, is whether the age should be reduced to 16, which is the general age of consent for sexual activity.",2
1191,"There might appear to be an argument consistency here, but it is surely eclipsed by the need to recognize that many children remain dependent on their parents until they are 18.",2
1192,"Indeed, the CLRC recommended that the age should be no lower than 21.",2
1193,"Another issue is whether brother — sister incest should remain criminal where both parties are aged 18 or over: when sentencing, the courts treat this as a much less serious form of the offence than father — daughter incest, and a majority of the CLRC accepted that brother — sister incest should cease to be an offence when both parties are aged 21 or over.",2
1194,"The reasoning behind this proposal seems to be that the two parties are adult, and any exploitation deriving from the family tie seems no more likely than in other adult relationships.",2
1195,"However, adulthood begins at 18 21, and we have an example of a desire to shield those aged under 21 which may actually lead to the penalization of some brothers and sisters of that age.",2
1196,8.8 PARAMETERS OF THE LAW ON SEXUAL ASSAULT,2
1197,It is evident from this survey of English law on sexual assault that the parameters are open to considerable argument.,2
1198,"Rules of antiquity (the definition of rape, and the marital exemption), of modernity (the definition of incest), and of recent creation (the doctrine of mistake in rape) are being called into question.",2
1199,"There can be little doubt that the administration of criminal justice has paid insufficient attention to problems of sexual abuse over the years, and recent improvements in police procedures and in services for victims are to be welcomed.",2
1200,"The difficult issue is how far this movement should be taken: changes which make it easier to convict men of sexual assault on women, or parents of the sexual abuse of children, cannot be welcomed unless one has a clear conception of the rights of defendants the rights of victims.",2
1201,It is one thing to maintain that victims of sexual assault have  in the past suffered oppressive questioning by the police and oppressive cross-examination in court.,2
1202,"It is quite another thing to suggest that it is therefore proper to place higher burdens of proof on defendants, and to restrict the presentation of the defence.",2
1203,Each of these proposals deserves careful examination from both points of view.,2
1204,The starting-point must be the empirical evidence of the effects of sexual assaults.,2
1205,"These are variable, , but in many cases there are severe psychological after-effects — trauma, fear, and mistrust — which deeply affect the victim's ability to lead a normal life for some time to come.",2
1206,"It is not suggested that each offence should be ranked the seriousness of its after-effects on the particular victim — although there is an argument for assuming that young victims will be particularly damaged by unwanted sexual experiences, and therefore for regarding such offences as more serious.",2
1207,"To transfer this judgment of seriousness into desirable legal responses is no easy matter, however, for two powerful reasons.",2
1208,"First, children might refrain from reporting or giving evidence if they know that a substantial prison sentence for a member of their family is the probable outcome.",2
1209,"Second, defendants might defend cases more vigorously, causing greater trauma to child witnesses, if substantial imprisonment is probable.",2
1210,"It can therefore be argued that, serious as the offence usually is, a policy of non-custodial treatment might be preferable the effects on child victims.",2
1211,"So far as ranking the relative seriousness of sexual assaults is concerned, however, full account should be taken of the psychological effects of such offences.",2
1212,"Above all, one must avoid any tendency to equate the degree of harm with the degree of physical injury in a particular case, since the psychological harm may be far more severe.",2
1213,"This chapter has dealt chiefly with the non-consensual offences, and this is important, because it is the absence of consent which is the crucial factor in many cases of sexual assault.",2
1214,"Such offences attack the principle of freedom of choice in sexual matters, and this, together with the punishment of those who exploit the young, the mentally handicapped, and those for whom they have responsibility, should form the bedrock of the scheme of offences.",2
1215,"This is not the place to embark upon detailed discussion of possible schemes for grading sexual assaults, but questions have been raised about the exclusion from the English offence of rape of oral and anal intercourse and penetration of the vagina by other objects.",2
1216,There is evidence to suggest that victims of these other forms of serious sexual assault regard them as no less serious than rape (narrowly defined).,2
1217,"There is a strong argument for extending the offence of rape to cover these other sexual indignities, or for restructuring the law there are degrees of sexual assault.",2
1218,"The sentencing decision in (1986) marks out some of the more serious varieties of sexual assault, and this could be used as a basis for introducing a new scheme of three or four graded offences: there are precedents for this in other countries.",2
1219,"One approach would be to have first-degree sexual assault defined to include penetration involving the penis, vagina, or anus, together with the threat or infliction of grievous bodily harm; then a second-degree offence of the same nature involving a threat or infliction of actual bodily harm; and then a third-degree offence covering all other sexual assaults involving penetration, and a fourth offence to cover indecent assaults not involving penetration.",2
1220,"The CLRC did give serious consideration to dividing indecent assault into two grades, so the idea of grading is not entirely alien to England.",2
1221,"One argument sometimes raised against it is that it would lead to plea-bargaining, and thus to offenders escaping with lesser convictions and lesser sentences.",2
1222,"The fact is that this is a prominent feature of the existing law, in which there are only two major offences (rape and indecent assault) and in which some 42 of those charged with rape have a plea of guilty to indecent assault accepted by the court.",2
1223,"A more refined gradation of offences could not be worse in this respect, and might improve the fairness of the labels and sentences imposed on sexual offenders.",2
1224,"One other consequence of a fresh gradation of sexual offences might be that they would cease to be gender-specific: there are some strange inconsistencies in the law , and it is not difficult to draft offences which might be committed by males or females against males or females.",2
1225,One feature of the discussion in this chapter has been to challenge the use of the concepts of consistency and ‘inexorable logic’ as  unanswerable standards of appraisal of the law.,2
1226,"This is not to suggest that consistency is an unworthy value: the argument is rather that there is a need to decide upon the categories to which the argument of consistency is being applied, and above all to recognize that simple resort to the allegation of inconsistency might serve to conceal the conflict between a number of social interests or principles.",2
1227,"One example is the doctrine of mistake in rape: it might appear to be ‘inexorable logic’ that if the offence of rape is only committed where D knew that the woman was not consenting or was reckless her non-consent, a mistaken belief that she was consenting would lead to an acquittal.",2
1228,"The inexorable logic does not, however, establish that the result is morally or socially desirable.",2
1229,"There is a powerful argument that as far as sexual behaviour is concerned, an area in which consent makes the difference between gross violation and shared pleasure, and in which physical proximity makes it relatively easy to ask about consent, the law should in effect impose a duty to enquire.",2
1230,This would be done by limiting exculpatory mistakes to those based on reasonable grounds.,2
1231,It would partly alter the definition of rape or serious sexual assault; it would introduce an element of negligence liability; and it would also make D liable for an omission.,2
1232,"But all those changes could be justified respect for the principle of freedom of choice in sexual matters, particularly where the enquiry is so straightforward.",2
1233,"A similar argument could be mounted mistakes about age in the offences against girls and boys under 16: the basic principle of fairness to defendants underpins the subjective requirement of fault, but there is also the social policy against exploitation of the young and vulnerable.",2
1234,"This social policy might support a duty to enquire about age wherever there might be room for doubt, and the ease of compliance (the inevitable physical proximity of the parties) again favours the requirement.",2
1235,"In practice, there might be situations of doubt; a man might claim that there was nothing to alert him to the girl's age (e.g. a 15-year-old girl, who looks much older, soliciting in a street with other prostitutes).",2
1236,"Moreover, if the criminal law is to impose duties of these kinds, it should publicize them widely, to ensure compliance with the principle of legality.",2
1237,"The point of this argument is not to maintain that there would be no practical problems, but to demonstrate that there are weighty issues of principle on both sides.",2
1238,Appeal to ‘inexorable logic’ or consistency cannot conclude the argument: it over-simplifies the issues.,2
1239,"One policy, already mentioned, which should continue to shape  the law of sexual offences is the criminalization of those who exploit the young and vulnerable.",2
1240,"This is achieved through special offences and through rules invalidating apparent consent given by those under 16, and it is supported by the rule against convicting a participant who falls within the class protected by the offence concerned.",2
1241,"The relevant ages of consent in English law vary: 16 seems to be the general age, but the offence of gross indecency with or towards children only applies where the child is under 14, and the age of consent for homosexual offences is 21 and the recommendation is to lower it only to 18.",2
1242,", consistency is a proper starting-point for critical appraisal, but it is important to examine any special circumstances attendant on particular offences.",2
1243,", is there any substance in the claim that young men of 16 and 17 are more vulnerable, socially and psychologically, than young women of a similar age?",2
1244,"Certainly there appears to be some sense in restricting any changes in the law of incest it continues to be an offence for a parent or grandparent to have sexual relations with a child aged 16 or 17, because children of that age are often dependent and living at home, and so the conditions for exploitation are still present at that age.",2
1245,", the policy of using the law against those who indulge in sexual exploitation of the vulnerable may conflict with the ‘logic’ of overall consistency in age-limits, and this conflict must be acknowledged and confronted.",2
1,a Non-punitive Paradigm of Probation Practice: Some Sobering Thoughts L.R. SINGER,3
2,Lawrence Singer is an Assistant Chief Probation Officer with Merseyside Probation Service.,3
3,Beforehand he worked as a probation officer for Berkshire Probation Service and later as a research officer for Somerset Probation Service where he undertook the research reported here.,3
4,"The paradigm which is described originates from doctoral research into generic probation practice and has been presented in a book (1989, Gower).",3
5,SUMMARY,3
6,The Government White Paper proposes a radical change for probation practice.,3
7,Henceforth probation work will be an alternative to punishment but an alternative form of punishment.,3
8,This article challenges the conceptual and practical appropriateness of applying the notion of punishment to the probation context.,3
9,"Probation officers, it is argued, are concerned with establishing rules for probationers and not inflicting pain on them.",3
10,An alternative non-punitive paradigm of probation practice is described.,3
11,"The paradigm is based on the joint supervisory aims of support and surveillance which are implemented through the methods of counselling, assisting, directing, and monitoring.",3
12,"To illustrate the paradigm, reference is made to an alcohol education course developed for offenders in trouble through drink.",3
13,The efficacy of the alcohol project and the non-punitive paradigm is demonstrated by the results reported from a three year evaluation study covering 152 offenders.,3
14,"The article concludes with an affirmation of the disciplined but non-punitive character of current probation work and argues that, to successfully protect the public and reintegrate offenders into the community, the probation officer's employment of established social work knowledge, skills, and values is a strength not a weakness.",3
15,"The aim of this article is to challenge the assertion contained in the White Paper (Home Office, 1990a) that probation practice can be conceived of as a form of punishment in the community.",3
16,Issue will be taken with the appropriateness of applying the concept of punishment to the probation context through reference to a demanding and successful probation project concerned   with offenders in trouble through drink.,3
17,"In describing the project, a non-punitive model for understanding probation practice will be developed.",3
18,"This non-punitive paradigm will provide a framework for contrasting the efficacy of current practice with future plans inappropriately to transform probation work into ‘a new approach to punishment in the community’(p. 18, para. 4.3).",3
19,The punitive approach anticipated for the Probation Service in the White Paper is underpinned by a definition of punishment that resides ‘in the restrictions on liberty and in the enforcement of the orders’.,3
20,"The White Paper goes on to emphasize: ‘It is the loss of liberty involved in carrying out the terms of the order the activities carried out during the order which is the punishment’(p. 18, para. 4.4).",3
21,"Notwithstanding the popular appeal and political capital to be derived from such a humane-sounding statement, this definition is nevertheless at variance with the traditional understanding of the meaning of punishment.",3
22,"Discourses on punishment and dictionary definitions of the term clearly specify the central feature of punishment as being the infliction of pain the loss of liberty (Hudson, 1987).",3
23,The conceptual and practical implications of this discrepancy will be examined in the third and final section of this article.,3
24,"Beforehand, however, consideration will be given first to the probation project and second to its evaluation.",3
25,In these sections punishment will be understood to mean the infliction of pain and the review of the project will seek to demonstrate that the probation practice described is not only more demanding but also more effective than this traditional understanding of punishment.,3
26,"At a time when the Home Secretary is inviting the Probation Service to ‘move centre stage in the Criminal Justice System’(NACRO, 1990, p. 17) it may seem misguided and unnecessarily pedantic to take issue with the White Paper's notion of punishment.",3
27,Punishment is just a word after all: nothing more than convenient political rhetoric meriting only lip-service from probation managers and practitioners poised at the ‘window of opportunity’.,3
28,"However, this fails to acknowledge a fundamental axiom of social work practice; namely that language not only reflects but also shapes social reality.",3
29,"As Davies (1981) has pointed out, speech is the basic tool of the social worker.",3
30,"What we say influences what we think and in turn, what we do.",3
31,If punishment is assimilated into the probation glossary it will inevitably influence the sort of practice the Service undertakes.,3
32,"In the sections to follow the stark question is therefore put ‘Is the Probation Service in the business of inflicting pain?’ and the answer which unfolds may be summarized ‘No, because it neither aspires nor wishes to!’",3
33,THE PROJECT: MORE DEMANDING THAN PUNISHMENT,3
34,Government concern about the problem of drink-related offending is as old as the Probation Service.,3
35,"Indeed, as Bochel (1976) has shown, the establishment of a Probation Service in England and Wales was inextricably linked with work undertaken with offenders in trouble through drink.",3
36,Almost a century later the new approach to punishment in the community outlined by the White Paper presents alcohol misuse as a key problem requiring community-based intervention.,3
37,"‘Alcohol’, the White Paper states, ‘is implicated in a wide variety of crimes, drunken driving, offences of public disorder and domestic violence’(p. 21, para. 4. 14).",3
38,In describing its vision of effective supervision the White Paper goes on to note:,3
39,offenders take part in alcohol education programmes they can learn to drink sensibly.,3
40,"They learn about the relative strength of different drinks, the amount which is safe to consume, and the pitfalls to avoid (e.g. competitive drinking and buying ‘rounds’)(p. 37, para. 7.11).",3
41,"As a summary of alcohol education programmes, this is something of a simplification.",3
42,However it does provide a useful introduction to the origins of the Alcohol Education Course reported here.,3
43,"Furthermore, it highlights the suitability of referring to this type of project for testing out the appropriateness of applying the notion of punishment to probation practice.",3
44,"In 1985 the management of Somerset Probation Service was faced with the fact that nearly one in three of the offenders supervised in their area were either known to be or suspected of misusing alcohol (Singer, 1985).",3
45,"Aware of practitioners' frustration in not being able to work effectively with these problematic clients, Probation management, in partnership with the voluntary sector, determined to develop an Alcohol Education Course (AEC).",3
46,"By 1986, when social inquiry report monitoring information covering 1,257 offenders indicated that the problem of drink-related offending was virtually as great for pre- post-sentence clients, , alcohol was cited as a pre-offence problem in twenty-nine of cases, a specialist project worker had been appointed.",3
47,Towards the end of 1986 an AEC was launched and has been running ever since.,3
48,The aim of the course is to educate offenders about alcohol to facilitate a lasting change in their subsequent use of this drug.,3
49,"This aim is underpinned by three interrelated objectives and it is not without significance how they complement and serve to implement the White Paper's own trinity of ‘aims of supervision’, , protection of  the public, prevention of reoffending and successful reintegration of the offender in the community (p. 35, para. 7.3).",3
50,These were:,3
51,1.,3
52,To increase knowledge about alcohol future alcohol use can be more informed and therefore more prudent.,3
53,2.,3
54,To instil or reinforce responsible drinking attitudes and behaviour.,3
55,3.,3
56,"To encourage the maintenance of, or, where appropriate, a reduction to a personally and socially safe level of alcohol unit intake.",3
57,"To meet these objectives the AEC has a structured programme involving group and individual contact, , six group sessions sandwiched between one-to-one interviews held immediately before and after the group .",3
58,"The initial one-to-one meeting, held with one of the two group leaders, serves to clarify what participants can expect from the course and what is expected of them.",3
59,A standard contract which covers conditions of attendance and an agreement to complete various assignments between group sessions is signed by each participant.,3
60,"The final interview entails a personalized review of the course, the formulation of a follow-up plan to be undertaken with the offender's supervising officer.",3
61,"The course employs a variety of materials and techniques including the use of checklists, magazine and newspaper clippings, quizzes, videos, brainstorm exercises, discussions, drink diaries, and role plays (Menary, 1986).",3
62,The AEC is primarily intended for young adults a probation order with a special condition of attendance (Schedule 11 4A(II) Criminal Justice Act 1982) and reflects the fact that most Somerset offenders in trouble through drink commit serious offences and/or possess a substantial number of previous convictions.,3
63,", they are seriously at risk of committing further offences and becoming trapped in the revolving door of custody.",3
64,The development of the Somerset AEC both accords with and constitutes a practical example of the Home Office's recent guidance to sentencers:,3
65,In recent years the probation service has devoted increasing resources to supervising the more serious and persistent offenders.,3
66,"Probation orders which are combined with constructive, disciplined and effective programmes of supervision are increasingly being used for offenders who stand to receive custodial sentences (1990b, p. 35).",3
67,From the description of the AEC already given the demanding and disciplined nature of the course can be appreciated.,3
68,"However, the course is not punitive; it is not concerned with the infliction of pain.",3
69,"Instead, it is concerned with the establishment of rules.",3
70,This is plainly evident from the section of the contract signed by each participant where what is expected of them is spelt out:,3
71,"You will be expected to keep a drink diary throughout the course, and make  attempts at reducing the amount you drink if it is greater than accepted healthy drinking levels.",3
72,You must be willing to be helped and help others — your experiences will be useful to other group members.,3
73,"You must attend 8 sessions (these will consist of: an introductory session, six group sessions and a final assessment interview).",3
74,You must not drink before the session.,3
75,You must be on time — lateness will count as an absence.,3
76,"Unlike the prison inmate, AEC participants cannot sit back and passively do their time.",3
77,"Probation practice is not, however, solely concerned with the establishment of rules.",3
78,"As has been demonstrated elsewhere the generic probation setting (Singer, 1989), the supervision of offenders involves two overarching aims: namely support and surveillance.",3
79,Support refers to anything which is said or done to help the offender solve or mitigate their personal or social problems: surveillance to anything which is said or done to induce the offender to conform to socially acceptable standards of behaviour.,3
80,These aims are implemented through the practice of four distinguishable but related methods.,3
81,"support, there is counselling and assisting: surveillance, there is directing and monitoring.",3
82,Each of these four methods are employed during the eight sessions.,3
83,"Although summarized as an alcohol course, the sessions are not just concerned with giving information but also with enabling participants to make practical use of it.",3
84,"In the first group session the counselling method is registered in the course tutor's notes (Menary, 1986) by the explanation: ‘This session aims to get participants to consider the subject of alcohol in ways they had not thought of in the past’(p. 3).",3
85,During this session the importance of monitoring is also emphasized:,3
86,"Drinks exercises introduce the notion of measurement, concentration of alcohol content; information which will be necessary to carry out the recording of alcohol consumption throughout the duration of the course (p. 3).",3
87,"In the fifth group session entitled ‘Focus on the Individual’, the counselling and the monitoring combine with the directing and assisting methods.",3
88,At the start of the session the tutor's notes make clear that directing extends beyond enforcing the conditions of attendance:,3
89,This session allows for an in depth examination of the drinking diaries over the last five weeks — identifying the risky circumstances or situations….,3
90,The aim at the end of the session is to encourage participants to make rules for their future drinking which will lead to a lessening of identified problems (p. 4).,3
91,"Similarly, the assisting extends beyond simply providing handouts of useful information:",3
92,It is important that participants are provided with the skills to reduce their drinking levels or handle more effectively ‘pub centred’ problems.,3
93,"The use of role play, incorporating previously discussed difficulties (i.e. homework assignment session 4) in ‘real’ or set up situations provides an opportunity for testing these skills.",3
94,Probably the best illustration of the assisting method in action during the course comes in the fifth session when Somerset practitioners take the logic of working with the problem in the community to its ultimate conclusion.,3
95,"In the second half of the session, course leaders sponsor participants to an evening at the pub for the purpose of practising drinking skills and purchasing non-alcoholic drinks.",3
96,"The counselling, assisting, directing, and monitoring on the AEC give substance to the aims of support and surveillance and provide the basis for establishing a model of probation practice.",3
97,Punishment has no place in this model.,3
98,Instead the AEC can best be understood as an example of a non-punitive paradigm of probation practice.,3
99,"Twenty years ago the Advisory Council on the Penal System observed that notions of punitiveness do not accord with ‘the British concept of probation as an alternative to, a suspension of, punishment’(quoted in Bochel, 1976, p. 238).",3
100,Twenty years later the AEC demonstrates that this remains no less true now than it was then.,3
101,But does the AEC work?,3
102,THE EVALUATION: MORE EFFECTIVE THAN PUNISHMENT,3
103,"Home Office statistics, probation practice is more efficient and no less effective than imprisonment.",3
104,"At 1988/89 rates (Home Office, 1990b, p. 110), it cost on average £288 per week to keep an offender in custody, compared with £19 per week to supervise an offender on probation; yet the Home Office acknowledge: ‘It is hard to show any effect that one type of sentence is more likely than any other to reduce the likelihood of reoffending, which is high for all’(p. 7).",3
105,"If anything can be shown, it would appear that probation is more effective than prison in reducing the risk of further offending.",3
106,"In a review of reconviction rates, , a Home Office report concluded: ‘Those given probation orders were therefore less likely to be reconvicted within two years of being given probation than those released from custody’(Home Office, 1986, p. 5).",3
107,"Methodological objections could be made to comparing the two groups the different periods of time monitored, , for prisoners the period of time refers to after the sentence has been served whereas for probationers it is after the sentence has been imposed.",3
108,"Moreover, it could be argued that prisoners are more at risk of further offences than probationers , first, their commission of relatively more serious offences, and second, their more extensive and therefore more entrenched criminal careers.",3
109,This may be so for the population of probationers generally but does not apply to the AEC sample.,3
110,"As noted earlier, the AEC was designed for offenders at risk of further offending and/or custody.",3
111,Between 1986 and 1988 152 offenders undertook the AEC while simultaneously being monitored to assess the impact of the course upon them.,3
112,"As a sample of offenders, the course participants have more prisoners than probationers.",3
113,In Table 1 below a comparison of the offences committed by the sample and those committed by persons commencing probation or entering custody nationally is given.,3
114,"Whereas for theft and fraud type offences there were almost twice as many commencing probation nationally as amongst the AEC participants, the reverse was true for violence, burglary and criminal damage type offences.",3
115,The similarity between the AEC participants and offenders entering custody — persons commencing probation nationally — is clearly shown by the identical proportions each group recorded for violent offences.,3
116,"Furthermore, the greater proportion of other indictable offences for the AEC sample, compared with probationers nationally, reflected the large number of drink-driving offenders, , 25.",3
117,"Given this array of serious offences committed by the AEC sample it is not surprising that the average number of previous   convictions was seven, with only 10 having no previous convictions compared with 28 who had ten or more.",3
118,In this connection it is relevant to note that 84 of the sample had consumed alcohol the commission of their current offences and three four of the convictions for previous offences had been drink-related.,3
119,The possibility that the sample's previous convictions simply reflected persistent petty offending can be discounted because over a third had already received a custodial sentence (37 ); a further fifth community service (20 ); and nearly another fifth a probation or supervision order (17 ).,3
120,"Most of the sample were male (94 ), aged between seventeen and twenty-four (61 ) and the risk of further offending and custody is highlighted by the fact that over half of the sample had committed an offence within a year of the current offence.",3
121,"In Somerset the management of the Probation Service has reached an agreement with the local and neighbouring courts that Schedule 11 probation orders, , orders containing day centre or specified activity requirements, are operated as a direct alternative to custody.",3
122,"In this light the at-risk status of the sample is further indicated by the fact that 91 of the sample were Schedule 11, with only six being on ordinary probation and three on statutory licence following release from custody, , parole and youth custody licence.",3
123,"The large proportion of schedule 11 cases in the AEC sample contrasts dramatically with the proportion commencing probation nationally in 1988, , 63 of the AEC's probationers were a day centre requirement compared with only six nationally; similarly, 31 of the AEC probationers were a specified activity requirement compared with only six nationally (Home Office, 1990c, p. 46).",3
124,"The more highly convicted and at-risk profile of the AEC sample was also reflected by the fact that whereas nationally as many as 80 of the persons commencing probation in 1988 had no additional requirements made to their probation orders, only six of the probationers undertaking the AEC received this traditional type of probation order from the courts.",3
125,The evaluation of the AEC was based upon a comprehensive assessment of the extent to which the course was able to achieve its stated objectives.,3
126,"This involved the collection and analysis of five different types of information: an alcohol knowledge test, a drink profile questionnaire, a drink diary, a consumer questionnaire and reconviction rate statistics.",3
127,"The nature of the method, its relation to course objectives and the results obtained are described below.",3
128,"As will gradually become evident, the AEC has proven itself to be an unambiguous success.",3
129,ALCOHOL KNOWLEDGE TEST,3
130,The alcohol knowledge test (AKT) is a twenty item multiple choice test of alcohol knowledge.,3
131,"Each question, like the course overall, is practical in focus and concerned with information about the relative strength of different alcoholic drinks, detoxification times, legal limits and medical effects.",3
132,The purpose of the test is to provide an objective basis for assessing the nature and extent of participants' alcohol knowledge before and after doing the course.,3
133,"Accordingly, the AKT was administered during the first and last of the group sessions and constituted a straightforward method for evaluating the success of the first course objective: specifically, to increase participants' alcohol knowledge future alcohol use can be more informed and therefore more prudent.",3
134,It will probably not surprise the reader to learn that at the outset of the course serious gaps in participants' knowledge were identified.,3
135,", over half of the participants (56 ) did not know how many beers they could drink before reaching the legal limit for driving and well over two-thirds of them knew neither how long it took for alcohol to be burned up by the body (71 ) nor what, if anything, was an effective way of sobering up (71 ).",3
136,"However, by the conclusion of the course over three-quarters of the sample knew the beer equivalent to the legal limit (77 ); the correct detoxification time (78 ); and the fact that there is no effective way to accelerate the detoxification process (79 )— including a cold shower or a cup of strong coffee!",3
137,"When the sample's average score twenty was calculated, it revealed an increase from 9.5 to 14.3 twenty.",3
138,"This means that there was an overall increase in the participants' alcohol knowledge between the start and the finish of the course of 50.5 : not abstract knowledge, but knowledge that is relevant to drinking with associates in the pub or elsewhere.",3
139,"To test whether each of the participants' before and after scores were simply a fluke occurrence, as distinct from a genuine increase in alcohol knowledge, a Wilcoxon Matched Pairs Test was undertaken using SPSS and the result proved statistically significant, , Z= -10. 1839, 2-tailed, P=0.0000.",3
140,DRINK PROFILE QUESTIONNAIRE,3
141,"It does not necessarily follow that knowing more about alcohol will automatically result in more responsible drinking attitudes and behaviour, , the second course objective.",3
142,"Participants could, , attempt to make their attitudes consonant with their recently acquired knowledge only to find themselves unable to break from their  established pattern of behaviour (Festinger, 1957).",3
143,To measure the extent to which the AEC was able to successfully anticipate and overcome this potential problem a drink profile questionnaire (DPQ) was devised and administered before and after the course.,3
144,The DPQ is a Likert-style schedule comprising five possible answers attracting a score of between one and five points for twenty-five different questions concerned with key aspects of drinking attitudes and behaviour.,3
145,"When completing the DPQ participants were told that, unlike the AKT, there were no right answers.",3
146,"Regarding attitudes, participants were invited to rank from strongly agree (five points) to strongly disagree (one point) their level of agreement with statements ‘To enjoy yourself, it is necessary to have something to drink’ and ‘If you limit the amount you drink, it spoils your enjoyment’.",3
147,"Regarding behaviour, participants were asked to indicate from always (five points) to never (one point) the frequency of instances occurring where, , they got drunk they did not intend to; their drinking left them short of cash; they drank to help themselves deal with a crisis; and they missed meals because they wanted to drink instead.",3
148,The participants' answers were scored and their grand totals then checked against where they fell on a continuum of five risk levels ranging from very low to very high.,3
149,"Whereas in the AKT an upward trend is indicative of success, the reverse is true for the DPQ, , the lowering of risk level represents a shift towards having instilled or reinforced responsible drinking attitudes and behaviour.",3
150,It was precisely this type of downward shift that was recorded.,3
151,Between the first and the second DPQ over three-quarters of the participants either reduced to (72 ) or remained at (six ) a medium or low level of risk.,3
152,"To assess whether this before — after difference was merely a fluke occurrence the Wilcoxon Test was undertaken and the result proved statistically significant, , Z=-7.7565, 2-tailed, P=0.0000.",3
153,"Bearing in mind the course leaders' concern to instil or reinforce responsible drinking attitudes and behaviour, it is worth noting that before the course 77 of the participants agreed with the statement ‘To enjoy yourself, it is necessary to have something to drink’; yet by the end of the course 88 disagreed with this attitude.",3
154,"Similarly, whereas over half of the sample (57 ) admitted to always or mostly continuing to drink they knew they were intoxicated, at the end of the course 60 said this rarely or never occurred.",3
155,DRINK DIARY,3
156,"The third objective of the AEC is to encourage the maintenance of, or, where appropriate, a reduction to a personally and socially safe level of alcohol unit intake.",3
157,"Determining how much is too much is debatable but authoritative (if somewhat tough) guidelines have been set by Alcohol Concern the Health Education Council and the medical professions (Alcohol Concern, 1986, p. 5).",3
158,"Three levels of alcohol consumption are specified: low, moderate, and high.",3
159,Males consuming over 36 units of alcohol a week and females consuming 22 units have a high level and are advised to cut down immediately.,3
160,AEC participants were required to keep a weekly drink diary after each of the group sessions to monitor their drinking levels.,3
161,"Although it must be acknowledged that there is a danger of deliberate under-recording, the emphasis placed by the course on the value and importance of being honest with oneself appears to have resolved this problem.",3
162,The non-punitive approach of the course is reflected in its policy neither to reward low scores nor to punish underscoring.,3
163,"This is because the aim of the exercise is to provide the participants with a practical tool for monitoring their drinking: if they want to cheat, they will only be cheating themselves.",3
164,In this connection the comments from two of the participants were typical.,3
165,The first time I went he got us to do a drink diary and I know I didn't tell the truth.,3
166,I put down less than I had been drinking.,3
167,I don't know why I did that.,3
168,"I thought ‘What's the other person going to put down, is he going to do the same?",3
169,Well I don't want to be seen drinking more than he is!’,3
170,"As the group went on I was being truthful, I put down what I was drinking.",3
171,"The two lads that were with me at the end, they were being truthful.",3
172,Theirs went down but mine went up.,3
173,"These drink diaries are excellent, brilliant way nobody cheats.",3
174,You're only cheating yourself when you cheat.,3
175,They were easy to do.,3
176,"Information from the drink diaries, based on a comparison of the averages for the first and the last three weeks of the course, revealed a shift from high to moderate drinking levels for males, , from 40 to 32 units per week.",3
177,The nine females who undertook the course remained within the high zone but nevertheless registered a reduction from an average of 39 units to 28 units per week.,3
178,"Overall, almost three-quarters of the participants either reduced their intake (61 ) or remained at the same level (11 ) between the first and the last three weeks of the course.",3
179,"Using the Wilcoxon test this downward trend was again found to be statistically significant, , Z= — 4.9595, 2 — tailed, P= 0–0000.",3
180,CONSUMER FEEDBACK,3
181,"After completing the AEC, participants were interviewed to provide them with an opportunity to reflect and comment on the course.",3
182,Interviews were conducted by the research officer or the alcohol project worker (the course leaders) to ensure confidentiality; and a semi-structured interview guide was used.,3
183,"The guide covered questions about the participants' expectations, experience and evaluation of the course.",3
184,The interview transcripts run to some 121 pages and can only be superficially summarized here.,3
185,"However, five points of direct relevance to the success of the course and the applicability of the non-punitive paradigm warrant a brief mention.",3
186,"First, all the responses made, only two participants stated that their attendance on the course had not been worthwhile and none said that the course should be discontinued.",3
187,"Second, the vast majority of participants were able to indicate the practical, as distinct from abstract, usefulness of the course.",3
188,drinking and driving :,3
189,"I've learnt , my job depends on me driving and it's made me realise how much I can drink, how much I can't drink, what I can drink and realising about road accidents.",3
190,The amount you drink does affect your driving quite considerably,3
191,"Third, different aspects of the course appeared to cater for different needs.",3
192,For some the counselling was particularly appreciated:,3
193,"more knowledge, it made you think more about what you were doing really.",3
194,For others it was the assistance that was especially useful:,3
195,"When we all went to the pub and some of them went up and got non-alcoholic drinks and that, and they all said they couldn't go into a pub and do that and they done it, no problem.",3
196,I think it was useful going to the pub.,3
197,"Fourth, many participants frankly admitted that they had very low expectations at the outset: specifically that the course was simply designed to punish them, which they would give the minimum amount of attention possible.",3
198,All agreed that this was not,3
199,Their experience as the following comments clearly demonstrate:,3
200,I thought they were out to get me to be honest with you.,3
201,I thought they were out to get me as a punishment.,3
202,But I don't think so now.,3
203,He was just telling us and you learn.,3
204,"You've gotta face it haven't you, you've gotta face it whatever.",3
205,"If you don't face anything, you don't get anywhere.",3
206,I was frightened.,3
207,I thought it was going to be worse than it was.,3
208,It was good once  it got going.,3
209,I didn't think we would have the opportunity to say things — we all got a chance to speak.,3
210,"I really thought it was going to be ‘You must not drink ever again' and ‘You naughty boy, you mustn't do it ever again' sort of thing.",3
211,"I had the idea that it was going to be ‘Do this, do that’ but it wasn't like that.",3
212,"Finally (and in direct accord with the non-punitive approach of the course), the emphasis upon participants by the end of the course making their own rules — them being made by others — was greatly appreciated.",3
213,"My rules are to cut down drinking, control my temper if I am drinking, not to drink in a such a large group and not to waste much money.",3
214,"It's a good idea, you should set yourself your own targets so you can know.",3
215,RECONVICTION RATE STATISTICS,3
216,Positive test results and favourable feedback might be sufficient evaluation criteria the Criminal Justice System but reconviction rates for probation practice must remain the acid test.,3
217,"Before and after course results are important indices of immediate impact, but did participants manage to keep trouble with the law twelve months after completing the course?",3
218,"the assistance of the statistics department of Avon and Somerset Police, it was possible to answer this question and provide a fifth and final indicator of success.",3
219,"the high risk profile of the participants, , an average of seven previous and often recent convictions (see above), 95 or 63 of the sample were not recorded as having committed further offences during the twelve month follow-up.",3
220,"In other words, almost two three of the participants had kept further trouble through drink.",3
221,As one participant observed:,3
222,"Yea, drinking's always got me into trouble in the past, I mean now I've thought about it, I've thought what a stupid idiot I'd be, so you know if it wasn't for the course, then I probably would have gone and done it again, you know, without a second thought.",3
223,"Without the benefit of the results from a random allocation study based on experimental and control groups, second thoughts about how much of the two three success rate can be directly attributed to the AEC are inevitable.",3
224,"However, Phillpotts and Lancucki's (1979) authoritative study for the Home Office on reconviction rates offers a basis for provisional optimism.",3
225,"In their six year follow-up study of 5,000 offenders convicted of standard list offences in January 1971, they reported that:",3
226,"Offenders who were reconvicted within the follow-up period were likely to have  their first reconviction fairly soon after sentence (or, for those given custodial sentences, after discharge).",3
227,"Offenders with a large number of previous convictions were not only more likely to be reconvicted but were reconvicted sooner than those with few previous convictions (1979, p. 41).",3
228,"What is of particular relevance to the AEC sample is Phillpott and Lancucki's finding that 53 of all male offenders with five or more preconvictions were reconvicted within a year (1979, p. 24).",3
229,If the AEC had made no difference to the male participants with five or more preconvictions we would expect over half of them to have been reconvicted.,3
230,"However, as might be anticipated from the progress registered earlier improvements regarding alcohol knowledge, attitudes and behaviour, 53 only 42 of the ‘five or more’ male offenders were reconvicted.",3
231,DISCIPLINE: MORE APPROPRIATE THAN PUNISHMENT,3
232,"The idea espoused in the White Paper that restrictions on liberty will become ‘the connecting thread in a range of community penalties custody’(p. 19, para. 4.5) is conceptually flawed for two basic reasons.",3
233,"First, if restriction on liberty is the defining feature of punishment, what are we to make of the experience of children who have to go to school and adults who have to work for a living?",3
234,Is liberty not being restricted both intention and effect?,3
235,", employers and teachers keep registers of attendance and prescribe supervise the activities of their employees/pupils, , restriction by intent.",3
236,"Moreover, children attending school and adults turning up for work inevitably have their liberty restricted: simply because the engagement in one activity necessarily restricts their opportunity to participate in other activities, , restriction by effect.",3
237,It is patently absurd to regard attendance at school or work as a punishment.,3
238,"Second, the notion of a continuum of restriction ranging from community penalties to custody — neat as it sounds — fails to acknowledge the unique and painful experience of imprisonment.",3
239,"As Sykes (1971) has shown, confinement to and within a prison entails a number of pains.",3
240,"These involve physical, financial, and psychological hardships including the loss of liberty, goods and services, heterosexual relationships, autonomy, security and life chances post-custody.",3
241,"Lest anyone doubt the validity of these observations in England and Wales, consider the following admission about a custodial sentence from the Home Office:",3
242,It is likely to affect an offender's personal or financial prospects.,3
243,"There is the possibility that serious hardship will be inflicted on the offender's family, particularly those responsible for the care of young children….",3
244,"On release from custody, it can be very difficult for the offender to be reintegrated into the community.",3
245,"Furthermore, tor the young or inexperienced offender, mixing with more sophisticated inmates may deepen his anti-social attitudes and increase his criminal skills (1990b, pp. 8–9).",3
246,Probation practice cannot legitimately be placed on this sort of continuum.,3
247,"The description and evaluation of the AEC clearly demonstrates that, in their particular sphere of constructive influence, probation officers, like employers and teachers, are concerned with the establishment of rules and not the infliction of pain.",3
248,"Put another way, it is discipline, not punishment, which constitutes the connecting thread running through the diverse range of probation practice.",3
249,This point was made by one commentator during the first review of the ‘Probation System’ at the beginning of this century: his comments remain pertinent for the Home Office in their current review at the end of the century.,3
250,"Probation…is a test or trial of the character of a convicted offender under suspension of judgment, that the court may determine if the probationer be fit to retain his or her place as a helpful member of society, or being unfit, must be deprived of his or her liberty as a menace to society.",3
251,It is established for the purpose of correction and oversight.,3
252,It is a conditional freedom.,3
253,"It recognises that the newer and better way to govern the law-breaker is not through the expiring system of the cell and the lash, but rather through the mind and the heart (Bridgwater, 1909, p. 9).",3
254,"The punitive calculus, with its just deserts gloss, may have political appeal and offer an antidote to the soft image that has beset the Service since its inception.",3
255,"However, this is to mistake not only the demanding nature of current practice but also the non-punitive knowledge, skills, and values which provide for its success.",3
256,"The AEC is but one example of a number of fruitful initiatives undertaken by practitioners in and through the medium of counselling, assisting, directing and monitoring.",3
257,The non-punitive approach of probation officers is a strength a weakness.,3
258,Some years ago the ‘Nothing Works’ school of thought dominated the Probation Service.,3
259,"Now it seems that some things work, especially those like the AEC that are associated with what has come to be described as the problem-focused/task-centred approach (Roberts, 1990).",3
260,"These new ways of working are simply a consolidation of the established pattern among officers of personalizing their practice, , carefully matching their particular social work knowledge and skills to the unique needs of  the individual offender (Singer, 1989).",3
261,This trend reflects a developing and successful specificity of probation practice: the pity is that this specificity of practice has not been complemented by a more appropriate specificity of language from the authors of the White Paper.,3
262,The Role of Residential and Nursing Homes in the Last Year of People's Lives ANN CARTWRIGHT,3
263,"Ann Cartwright, B.Sc., Ph.D., is Director of the Institute for Social Studies in Medical Care",3
264,SUMMARY,3
265,Almost a quarter of a random sample of adults dying in 1987 had spent part of the last year of their lives in a residential or nursing home; one in eight spent all of that year in one.,3
266,"The old, the unmarried.",3
267,"those with difficulty looking after themselves, the confused, the incontinent, the blind, the deaf, and the bad tempered were more likely to be in such homes than others.",3
268,With their greater dependency.,3
269,people living in residential homes received rather more consultations and home visits — although not night calls — from their general practitioners.,3
270,"But they did not get more help from community nurses and they were less likely to be admitted to, or to die in, a hospital or hospice.",3
271,"the assessments of relatives, friends, and neighbours who answered the questions, the quality of life of people who had been in a residential home for a year or more before their death was similar to that of others who died but had never been in such a home.",3
272,It was those who were admitted in the year before they died who were perceived as having a relatively poor quality of life in that year.,3
273,"Increasingly, the quality of life during the year before death is going to depend on the attributes of residential homes and their staff.",3
274,"The marked rise in the number of residential homes, particularly the recent growth in the private sector (DHSS, 1987; Bebbington and Tong 1986; Laing, 1985) has drawn attention to the somewhat uncertain role of these homes (Judge and Sinclair, 1986).",3
275,"Two areas of concern are first, who should have residential care and second, the relationship between residential and community care.",3
276,A recent study of people's lives in the year before their death makes it possible to examine the part residential and nursing homes play in caring for people during the   twelve months before their death.,3
277,"This paper then looks at the characteristics of the people who spent some or all of their time in such homes and at the care they got from general practitioners, community nurses and hospitals.",3
278,Care and conditions in the homes and the extent of visiting are described and a final section considers the quality of people's lives as perceived by their relatives and others.,3
279,METHODS,3
280,The data come from a study of a random sample of adult (aged 15 and over) deaths in ten areas of England in October and November 1987.,3
281,For these deaths we tried to identify and then interview the people who could tell us most about the last twelve months of the lives of the people who died.,3
282,"Someone was interviewed about 639 of the deaths, 80 of the original sample of 800.",3
283,"Husbands or wives were seen about 36 of the 639, other relatives about 43 , friends or neighbours about 10 , staff of institutions about 10 and other officials about one .",3
284,"Staff of institutions responded about 18 of those who had been in residential homes for less than a year, 47 of those in one for longer.",3
285,", the answers from different types of respondent did not differ all that widely and the variations that emerged seemed, , understandable the characteristics and circumstances of the people they were telling us about, although there did seem to be a tendency for the staff of homes to put a more rosy interpretation on situations.",3
286,"For an analysis of these differences, and for further details about the study, see Cartwright and Seale (1990).",3
287,TYPES OF HOMES AND NUMBERS RECEIVING CARE,3
288,"The ‘homes’ covered in this study include residential homes for older people, nursing homes and other institutions excluding hospitals or hospices.",3
289,For convenience they are referred to here as residential homes.,3
290,"Fourteen of the sample of deaths occurred in such homes; this compares with a much lower proportion, 5 in 1969 (Cartwright .,",3
291,1973).,3
292,"A further 9 of the people who died spent part of the last twelve months of their lives in such homes; so almost a quarter, 23 , were in residential homes at some stage in the last year of their lives.",3
293,The length of time they spent there and the types of homes involved are shown in Table 1.,3
294,"Those classed as ‘other homes’ included convalescent homes, a rehabilitation centre, an assessment centre, a holiday home for the disabled and rest homes which may in practice have been homes for older people (the classification was made on the basis of the information given by the person interviewed).",3
295,A relatively high proportion of those in other types of home were there for less than a month.,3
296,"Sixty-two of those in old people's homes had been there for a year or more compared with 47 of those in nursing homes, but this difference might have occurred by chance.",3
297,"Of the old people's homes, 56 were said to be run by the Council, 6 by a charity and 39 were private.",3
298,"In contrast the great majority of nursing homes, 83 , were privately run.",3
299,Nearly a quarter of those in nursing homes had not had to pay towards the cost of living there compared with only 7 of those in old people's homes.,3
300,The reason for the difference seemed to be that the DHSS paid for nursing home treatment in a number of instances: ‘They took the pension and attendance allowance and the DHSS paid the rest.’,3
301,"Nevertheless the proportion for whom payment was thought to have been something of a problem was 7 of all those in old people's homes (15 for private ones, 6 for others) and 17 of those in nursing homes — further differences which did not reach statistical significance.",3
302,WHO SPENDS ALL OR ANY PART OF THE LAST YEAR OF THEIR LIFE IN A RESIDENTIAL HOME?,3
303,"AGE, SEX AND FAMILY?",3
304,People who lived longer were more likely to have spent some or all of the last year of their lives in residential homes.,3
305,People have been counted as spending all of the last year of their lives in residential homes if they had lived in one for a year or more.,3
306,"(In fact, as will be seen later, a number of them were admitted to hospital during the last twelve months of their lives and some died in hospital.)",3
307,Few under 75 had spent any time in such homes but more than half those dying when they were aged 85 or more had spent some of the last year of their lives in one.,3
308,The figures are in Table 2 which also shows expected age related differences with sex and marital status.,3
309,Further analyses by age and marital status showed that married people less often spent any time in residential homes than single or previously married people of the same age.,3
310,"The proportions among those aged 75 — 84 were 8 of the married, 34 of the others, and for those aged 85 or more 25 compared with 61 .",3
311,Neill .,3
312,(1988) found that few married people applied for residential care and those who did so were less likely to be admitted than applicants who were single or widowed.,3
313,"There were no significant differences in the present study between the never and the previously married although it might be expected that people with children might be less likely to go into a home than those without any and the widowed, divorced, or separated are much more likely to have children than the single: 75 compared with 6 .",3
314,"An analysis by marital status and number of children showed that for the married the main difference was between those with no children, 17 of whom had been in a residential home, and those with one or more, for whom the proportion was 5 .",3
315,For the widowed or divorced there was no difference between those with and without children nor any significant trend with the number of children.,3
316,"So it would seem that children may assist one parent to care for the other who might otherwise go into a home, but this they have   to residential homes for some while caring for and thus avoiding the admission of others, and that these two influences cancel out in the statistics.",3
317,An analysis by the sex of children showed no significant differences between those with a son or sons only and those with only a daughter or daughters.,3
318,"An earlier study (Cartwright .,",3
319,1973) found that those with a daughter or daughters were more likely to die in their own homes than those with just a son or sons.,3
320,Data in Table 2 suggest that those with living brothers or sisters may be less likely to be admitted to a home.,3
321,Part of this is an age effect: the proportion with such relatives falling from 86 of those aged 45 — 54 to 41 of those aged 85 or more.,3
322,Among those aged 85 or more a similar proportion of those with and without living siblings had been admitted to a home at some stage but among those aged 75 — 84 more of those without any such relatives had been admitted: 30 compared with 17 .,3
323,These variations reflect the fact that siblings themselves age and die and therefore become less of a source of support as people grow older.,3
324,CAUSE OF DEATH,3
325,"People who died of cancer were less likely than those dying from other causes to have been in such homes, 7 against 29 .",3
326,The difference remains when the age at which they die is taken into account.,3
327,(Cause of death was taken from the death registration form as coded by OPCS.),3
328,"When the type of home was taken into account, those dying of respiratory disease were more likely to have been in nursing homes — 14 compared with 6 for those dying of other conditions — whereas those dying of stroke were more likely to have been in old people's homes: 27 against 12 .",3
329,SELF CARE,3
330,"The proportions reported to have had difficulty with various aspects of caring for themselves (getting in and a bath or shower, dressing and undressing, going to the toilet, washing and shaving, feeding themselves, making a hot drink, or needing help at night) for a year or more before death was 87 of those who had been in a residential home for a year or more, 60 of those in for a shorter time and 25 of those who had not been in such a home .",3
331,(People who had been in a hospital for all the year before they died have been excluded from these comparisons.),3
332,"But many of the symptoms asked about were reported for similar proportions of those who had been in residential homes and those who had not; these were pain, trouble with breathing, vomiting or feeling sick, drowsiness, sleeplessness, dry mouth or thirst, depression, loss of appetite, difficulty swallowing, dizziness, bed sores, an unpleasant smell, and backache.",3
333,"However, for a number of these symptoms, more people in residential homes had had them for a year or more: the proportions were 31 against 20 for drowsiness, 22 against 14 for dizziness, 19 against 11 for loss of appetite and 4 against one for bedsores.",3
334,"Only one symptom, a persistent cough, was reported more often for those who had been in a residential home — 24 compared with 10 of those who had spent some time in such a home.",3
335,When deaths from cancer were excluded the difference remained: 22 against 9 .,3
336,SYMPTOMS,3
337,The symptoms reported more frequently for those in residential homes are shown in Table 3.,3
338,"Several of them — constipation, confusion, urinary incontinence and difficulty seeing and hearing — have been shown elsewhere to increase with age (Cartwright, 1990a).",3
339,"Some of them, mental confusion, incontinence and difficulty seeing and hearing, may have contributed to them being admitted to such homes.",3
340,They can certainly make it more difficult for people to look after themselves.,3
341,"And among those people with confusion, constipation and incontinence, those in residential homes were more likely to have had the symptoms for a year or more.",3
342,"The figures were 81 compared with 39 for confusion, 78 and 52 for constipation, and 54 against 36 for incontinence.",3
343,Bad temper might result from being in such a home.,3
344,"Another explanation for the relatively high proportion of those in residential homes reported to be bad tempered could be that relatives, friends or neighbours were less likely to report or perceive the person who died as being bad tempered than staff of institutions.",3
345,"Among those in residential homes the frequency with which bad temper was reported was 31 when the respondent was a relative, friend or neighbour, 45 when he or she was a staff member — a difference which did not reach statistical significance.",3
346,"But if the comparison between those who   had been in a home and others is confined to those for whom relatives, neighbours or friends were interviewed, there is still a difference: 31 against 19 .",3
347,Bad temper could be either a cause or effect of being admitted to a residential home.,3
348,"Other studies have found that caring relatives are more likely to favour residential care as a solution for the elderly confused if the old person exhibits difficult behaviour (Levin .,",3
349,1989).,3
350,So the evidence suggests that their age and frailty those living in residential homes will have needed more care during the last year of their lives than other people who died.,3
351,CARE FROM GENERAL PRACTITIONERS,3
352,People in residential homes remain under the care of general practitioners.,3
353,"The numbers of consultations, home visits and night calls reported for those in such homes for a year or more before they died are compared with those for others under the care of a general practitioner in Table 4.",3
354,"As expected, those in residential homes had more consultations and more visits from their general practitioners than others.",3
355,"But, if anything, they had rather fewer night calls.",3
356,night calls are usually made in a crisis and the help normally available in residential homes may make it easier to cope with a minor one without calling out a doctor.,3
357,"In the minority of homes (a quarter) where all the residents had the same doctor, visiting rates were higher (16.8 a year on average) than in the majority (three-quarters) where the residents could have different doctors (9.5).",3
358,"However, the proportions for whom the general practitioner was described as reluctant to visit, or for whom it was felt it would have been helpful if the doctor had visited the person who died more often, did not vary significantly between the groups.",3
359,So it would seem that people in homes where they were free to have a doctor of their own choice were not seen as being more deprived of visits having fewer of them than people in homes where everyone had the same doctor.,3
360,Those in homes where everyone had the same doctor might receive less individual attention at visits if general practitioners saw several patients on the same visit.,3
361,The mixture of praise and criticism for general practitioners' care of people in residential homes was similar to comments about their care of others during the last year of their lives.,3
362,"Although most respondents praised, or were satisfied with, this care the study identified a number of inadequacies.",3
363,"Home visits were much appreciated when they happened   but failure to visit was one of the more common and significant criticisms (Cartwright, 1990b).",3
364,"The matron of a residential home, talking about a doctor who she felt was reluctant to visit said it would have been helpful if the person who died had been visited more often: ‘It would have given her more comfort and the staff more confidence.’",3
365,"When asked why she thought the doctor had not come more often, she replied, ‘The doctors feel the residents are in a rest home to  save them working.’",3
366,"The doctor had not been asked to come more often ‘because we're resigned to the fact that, unless it's an emergency, he won't come out.’",3
367,The matron also told us that this patient had to go into a nursing home ‘towards the end’ because ‘she needed morphine injections which the doctor wouldn't give otherwise she wouldn't have had to move to somewhere strange.,3
368,"She had to leave her room, her furniture: that's why she gave up.’",3
369,CARE IN HOSPITAL,3
370,People who had lived in old people's homes were less likely than others who died to have gone into a hospital or hospice during the last year of their lives or to die in one.,3
371,This can be seen from the figures in Table 5 which also suggest that the longer the time they had lived in an old people's home the less likely they were to go into hospital.,3
372,But those least likely to have spent time in a hospital or hospice or to die in one were those who had lived in a nursing home for a year or more.,3
373,This lower use of hospital inpatient facilities was not accounted for by the older age of the people in residential homes although fewer of all those aged 85 or more had spent time in hospital — 64 against 80 of those under 85.,3
374,"Among this older group 46 of those who had been in a residential home for a year or more were admitted, 75 of the others.",3
375,"There were similar differences when people   dying of respiratory disease and of cerebrovascular accident were considered separately: the proportions admitted to hospital were 25 and 47 of those in a residential home for a year or more, 76 and 89 of others among the two causes of death groups respectively.",3
376,The numbers dying of other causes were too small to analyse separately.,3
377,The only source of information from this study of any possible reluctance to admit people from residential homes to hospital relates to those who were admitted and respondents’ views on whether they should have been admitted earlier.,3
378,"This showed that in practice relatively few, one in ten, of those who had spent any time in residential homes were thought to have been admitted ‘too late’; this proportion was a quarter for those who had not spent any time in a residential home.",3
379,"Residential homes, and long stay nursing homes , appear to cut down the use of hospital care during the last year of people's lives.",3
380,What of the nursing care given by district and other nurses to those in old people's homes?,3
381,HELP FROM VISITING NURSES,3
382,"Just over a third, 35 , of those who had lived in an old people's home for a year or more had had help from a nurse who visited the home in the year before they died.",3
383,This was similar to the proportion receiving help from district and other nurses among those who had not spent any time in such homes once sudden deaths and those who had spent all their last year in hospital have been excluded.,3
384,They also received similar numbers of visits.,3
385,"Given their age, symptoms and frailty, it might have been thought that the residents of old people's homes would receive more care from visiting nurses than people in the community, as they received more visits from general practitioners.",3
386,But some of the less skilled tasks undertaken by district and other nurses for people living in their own homes were probably done by staff in the residential homes.,3
387,The next section looks at respondents' views of the care given to people in residential and nursing homes and the conditions there.,3
388,CARE AND CONDITIONS IN THE HOMES,3
389,"Almost nine tenths, 88 , of the people who had spent some time in a residential home were said to have had access to a telephone where they could make calls and people could telephone them.",3
390,"Among those  who did not have this facility, two-fifths were thought to have wanted it.",3
391,"Ninety-two of those in old people's homes compared with 82 of those in other sorts of homes had this amenity — a difference which fell short of statistical significance — but more of those in old people's homes had a room of their own, two-thirds against half.",3
392,Overall the proportion with a room of their own was three-fifths and again two-fifths of those without one were thought to have wanted one.,3
393,"If the respondent was a relative, friend, or neighbour, they were asked to say whether they thought various aspects of the home were good or not so good.",3
394,The replies of those who felt able to make these assessments are shown in Table 6.,3
395,"Clearly their views may have been different from those of the people who died, but respondents are likely to have taken into account the reactions of their relatives and friends, and how these respondents felt about the care in the homes is also of interest and concern.",3
396,"The most frequent criticism was of the food, and over this there was a difference between old people's homes for which 26 thought the food ‘not so good’ and nursing homes for which it was 7 .",3
397,"There were no differences between Council homes and private ones on any of these assessments, nor in the amenities available.",3
398,And the overall assessments of the homes were similar in the two groups and between nursing homes and old people's homes.,3
399,"Altogether 50 were described as ‘excellent’, 31 as ‘good’, 9 as ‘fair’, 6 as ‘poor’ and one as ‘dreadful’, with 3 making other comments.",3
400,A number of criticisms were exacerbated by feelings that people were in the wrong type of institution.,3
401,A son whose father had Parkinson's disease and had been in an old people's home commented:,3
402,"They were not equipped to deal with a progressive condition, they were not that kind of establishment.",3
403,The degree of mental stimulation was absent.,3
404,It was a very distressing time for him.,3
405,The whole point of his being there was his condition.,3
406,"He could have been in a hotel, had he not needed care and supervision which he blatantly did not get.",3
407,The daughter of a woman with Huntingdon's chorea who had been in a nursing home described the care she got there as,3
408,"Limited — not because they didn't want to care, they just didn't know how to care for this type of patient….",3
409,It should not be registered as a nursing home.,3
410,The one ‘dreadful’ home was thought to have contributed to the death of the man admitted there:,3
411,"It was an awful place: dreary, badly furnished and he wasn't as clean as he'd been in hospital — food all down his clothes and he hadn't shaved, he really looked unkempt.",3
412,I don't think the staff cared.,3
413,I'm sure the fact of moving to the home contributed to his death.,3
414,He was so well when he left hospital…and the deterioration within a week was unbelievable.,3
415,I just feel he gave up when he got in that home.,3
416,(Died of Parkinson's disease and pneumonia aged 73 within 24 hours of being readmitted to hospital after being in an old people's home for less than a month.),3
417,A number of respondents commented on the lack of stimulation: ‘They sat in the front room and didn't move.,3
418,"Just sat there, no t.v. and no-one seemed to talk to them.’",3
419,"When asked about the other residents in the homes, respondents' views were roughly equally divided about whether the person who died had on balance found them helpful (25 ) or tiresome (22 ).",3
420,"Most of them, however, 53 , made other comments, generally to the effect that the person had had little to do with other residents: ‘Her mind had gone so she was not able to socialise.,",3
421,"Many of the relatives and friends who rated the homes as an excellent place for the person who died to live towards the end of his or her life made rather perfunctory comments: ‘I can't fault the home’; ‘It was very nice, no qualms about it.’",3
422,Others were rather more forthcoming:,3
423,"I would say that, ‘spoon-feeding’ the residents, they tried to make them independent.",3
424,The staff were always there to help but didn't impose themselves.,3
425,This was very good.,3
426,And they kept her there when they could have sent her to hospital.,3
427,(Friend of woman who had had a number of strokes.),3
428,A wife whose husband had had multiple sclerosis and went to a holiday home for the disabled for two weeks to give her a rest said:,3
429,"It's a good idea, gets them home to meet new people.",3
430,They deserve a holiday like everybody else.,3
431,"He had a good time, said he really enjoyed it and would like to go again, and I had all the washing done for me — he didn't bring anything home dirty except the previous day's clothes.",3
432,Sometimes relatives and patients had obviously had different views of the home.,3
433,One daughter-in-law who rated the home as excellent went on to explain that her mother-in-law:,3
434,hated everything about everything.,3
435,We thought they were angels in the home and that everything was marvellous.,3
436,The staff told us she was the most difficult lady — as far as she was concerned nothing was right.,3
437,"She had to share (the bathroom and lavatory) much to her annoyance, but they were just her room.",3
438,You get what you pay for.,3
439,The views of people who had previously looked after those who died sometimes reflected their gratitude and admiration for the people who took on this task.,3
440,A friend of 30 years standing who had previously cared for a woman with senile dementia described how:,3
441,I thought she was just being awkward until she slowly went downhill and became incontinent.,3
442,I got help from the social services for this: they brought sheets and pillowcases from the hospital.,3
443,The crux came when she became doubly incontinent and her mind had got to the point where she had forgotten how her body functioned.,3
444,It was winter and I was changing her clothes three times a day and my self-control snapped and I shook her very hard to stop her sitting down without her pants and was so upset by my behaviour and frightened by what I had done that they agreed to put her in a home.,3
445,The young nurses were very kind and would kiss and cuddle her.,3
446,VISITING,3
447,"How much contact do people in residential homes have with relatives, friends, and neighbours outside?",3
448,This question is considered for people who had been in such homes for a year or more.,3
449,The number of different visitors they were reported to have had during the last twelve months averaged 5.0.,3
450,"Seven had none, 52 had one to four, 33 five to nine, and 8 ten or more.",3
451,"The number of visits was much greater: 11 had 300 or more — almost one a day, 33 between 100 and 300 — two or more a week on average, 19 50 — 99, between one and two a week, 4 20–49 — between one a fortnight and one a week, 14 10–19 — one a fortnight, 12 had 10 or one a month.",3
452,"The number of visits was strongly related to the number of visitors: of those with five visitors, a quarter had a hundred or more visits, but this proportion was three-quarters for those with five or more visitors.",3
453,"Of those who were visited, 44 had only relatives to see them, 11 were visited just by friends or neighbours and 45 by both relatives and friends; the most frequent visitor was a relative for 78 and a friend or neighbour for 22 .",3
454,Three of the five who had no visitors were said by the people we interviewed to have had no relatives.,3
455,"Neither of the other two who had no visitors had any children; one had elderly relatives abroad, the other, in the opinion of the deputy officer the home, only had herself to thank:",3
456,her awkward manipulative ways she just didn't get any visitors.,3
457,She did get visits from other visitors but they wore off her awkwardness.,3
458,…She went her way to be unpleasant to people.,3
459,Isaacs and his colleagues (1972) found that relatives' failure to provide basic care for elderly people was often associated with their previous rejection by the elderly person.,3
460,"However, for one in five of the people in residential homes for a year or more, our respondents said that there were relatives who they felt might have visited more often.",3
461,This compares with one in four of those living in the community who were felt to have relatives who might have helped more — a difference which might well occur by chance.,3
462,QUALITY OF LIFE,3
463,"Respondents were asked whether they would describe the quality of life of the person in the year before they died as good, fair, or poor.",3
464,Two things appeared to affect this assessment independently.,3
465,One was whether the respondent was a staff member or a relative.,3
466,Those spending any time in a residential home were less often described as having a poor quality of life if the respondent was a staff member than if he or she was a relative: 10 compared with 42 .,3
467,"This probably reflects the perceptions of the respondents a real difference in the actual quality of life of the people who died, although staff members may have been more willing to act as respondents for residents they had got on well with, and those residents may have had a better quality of life their relationship with the staff.",3
468,The other factor that was related to assessments of quality of life was whether people had been in a residential home for a year or more or for a shorter  time.,3
469,"Taking all types of respondents together their ratings were similar for people who had not been in a residential home and those who had been in one for a year or more, while those who had only spent part of the last year of their lives in a residential home were generally felt to have had a worse quality of life: for 39 of them it was rated as poor compared with 27 of the other two groups.",3
470,The difference between those spending all and those spending some of the last twelve months in a home persisted when the analysis is confined to those for whom relatives responded.,3
471,This can be seen in Table 7.,3
472,", among those for whom a staff member responded only one in twelve of those admitted during the last year of the life was felt to have had a good quality of life during that time compared with nearly half (46 ) of those who had been in a home for a year or more.",3
473,One possible explanation for these findings is that people take time to adjust to living in residential homes.,3
474,Another possibility is that those going into residential homes shortly before their death do so in a crisis situation.,3
475,Weaver and his colleagues (1985) found that residents most able to come to terms with admission were those who had exercised some degree of control or choice in entering residential care.,3
476,"Findings from the present study suggest that once people had become established in the homes their quality of life, in the opinion of their relatives, was similar to that of other people who died and had never been in such homes.",3
477,DISCUSSION,3
478,"Most of the people, just over two thirds, who spent all the last year of their life in a residential or nursing home were 85 or more, and it is this age group which is predicted to increase most rapidly in the next twenty years (Central Statistical Office (CSO), 1989) so it is likely that increasing numbers will spend the last year of their lives in such homes.",3
479,But this increase may not be as great as the rise in the numbers of older people if there is an improvement in their state of fitness as Jefferys and Thane (1989) suggest.,3
480,"The symptoms that were more common among those in residential homes, particularly confusion, incontinence, and bad temper, indicate some of the problems in making these homes attractive and stimulating places to live.",3
481,The description of one man of ninety-four illustrates many of the difficulties:,3
482,"He wasn't ill, it was just general deterioration.",3
483,"He was still quite active for his age, but his mental deterioration was the problem — he'd lost his sense of direction.",3
484,He found it difficult to accept his own failings.,3
485,"Memory loss was the worst aspect, the fact that he was unable to complete a crossword puzzle in ten minutes as he once could troubled him.",3
486,He was suffering from frustration.,3
487,"He was worried because he was deaf, worried his bowels.",3
488,He worried a lot.,3
489,"He was, I think, unhappy and tired.",3
490,He often said he'd had enough of living and was ‘ready to go’ was how he put it.,3
491,(Died from falling down a flight of steps and fracturing his skull.),3
492,That man was admitted to hospital after his fall and died there within a week without regaining consciousness.,3
493,"But people living in residential homes were less likely than others either to die in, or to be admitted to, hospital during the last year of their lives.",3
494,"Residential homes seem to cut down the use of hospital care; they probably also reduce the need for it, but this is less certain.",3
495,"They may also reduce the demand and need for night calls from general practitioners and, taking into account the age and frailty of residents, the pressures on the district nursing service.",3
496,the nature of the sample this study could not ascertain the views of residents themselves.,3
497,"Others who have done so have argued that elderly people are often faced with a choice between an unpleasant battle to survive in their own homes and an equally unpleasant enforced dependence in the institution (Wilkin and Hughes, 1987).",3
498,"In this study relatives and friends generally thought conditions in the home were ‘good’ ‘not so good’, although a number of their comments and descriptions indicate that circumstances were sometimes ideal and analysis of respondents' views of the quality of life suggest that  the initial period after admission may be particularly stressful for residents.",3
499,"While most residents were in fairly frequent contact with relatives and friends from outside the home, one in five of those who spent all the last twelve months of their lives in a home had either no visitors or one visit a month.",3
500,Becoming old and frail can be distressing; to be also isolated from relatives and friends seems dire.,3
501,The task of relieving avoidable distress and creating a caring and heartening environment in residential and nursing homes is going to be of increasing importance in determining the quality of the last year of people's lives.,3
502,How can we Measure the Effects of Client Participation on the Effectiveness of Social Work Intervention?,3
503,ALAN S. YORK and HAYA ITZHAKY,3
504,"Alan York was born in England and received his BA (in law) from Trinity College, Oxford in 1962.",3
505,"In 1963 he emigrated to Israel, took a certificate in Community Social Work in Tel Aviv and worked as a community worker in an immigrant development town.",3
506,He returned to England in 1970 and took his MA in Social Work at Leicester in 1972.,3
507,"He received his doctorate (in sociology) at Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel in 1979.",3
508,Haya Itzhaky was born and brought up in Israel and graduated from the School of Social Work at Bar-Ilan University in 1973.,3
509,"She worked as a community worker in an immigrant village, and took her MA (in social work) and her doctorate (in sociology) in Bar-Ilan.",3
510,"Both Dr York and Dr Itzhaky teach in the School of Social Work at Bar-Ilan University, where they are the community work specialization.",3
511,SUMMARY,3
512,This paper examines the concepts of client or citizen participation in community work and of effectiveness in social work and other related fields.,3
513,"It surveys and summarizes the literature in these two fields, focusing on how the two key concepts are empirically measured.",3
514,"After examining the literature on the effects of citizen participation on community work intervention, the paper puts forward an operative model for both researchers and practitioners to measure how the participation of clients can make community work more effective and productive.",3
515,"The underlying assumption (or, more accurately, hypothesis) of this paper is that client participation makes for a better social work intervention, and thus the higher the degree of client participation the more effective the intervention will be (Kurzman and Solomon, 1970; Freedberg, 1989; York, 1989).",3
516,In Bernstein's words:,3
517,"we find that imposing, telling or giving orders do not work well.",3
518,"Only as the client is thoroughly involved and comes to accept on deepening levels the   process of change can our methods be effective our goals (Bernstein, 1960, p. 8).",3
519,"Most of the debate on the validity and primacy of client self-determination has taken place within the casework context (Bernstein, 1960; McDermott, 1975; Freedberg, 1989) where the elements of eligibility, statutory rights, social control and professional authority may be of central importance (Rothman, 1989; Spicker, 1990).",3
520,"This paper will consider the issue in the context of community work, in which the elements accentuated by Rothman are of less consequence and client participation has indisputably remained a primary value.",3
521,We are currently engaged on a research project that seeks to test empirically whether client participation does indeed increase the effectiveness of community work intervention.,3
522,"We found much literature on client participation and even more on effectiveness, but there is considerable controversy on how to measure these variables.",3
523,Thus the scarce research work on the effects of participation on effectiveness is further limited by its inability clearly to define (and to measure) what it is studying.,3
524,"In this paper, we shall review the relevant literature, including that from other applied social sciences, and show the operative implications for research and practice.",3
525,"The first section will review the literature on client participation and its measurement, and the second section will summarize the ‘state of the art’ in the measurement of effectiveness, stressing evaluation of community work intervention.",3
526,The third section will review the published research linking participation and effectiveness in social work and other human welfare interventions and programmes.,3
527,"If these researchers had succeeded in measuring operatively and empirically what degree of participation was achieved and how this affected the degree of effectiveness, then our search would have been finished.",3
528,"The reader will have guessed, , that the quest was unsuccessful, and so the final section will suggest an operative model with practical implications for community work practitioners and researchers.",3
529,WHAT IS CLIENT PARTICIPATION AND HOW CAN WE MEASURE IT?,3
530,"Traditionally social workers have espoused client self-determination, the right of the clients to participate in decisions affecting their lives and interests (Kurzman and Solomon, 1970; Gilbert and Specht, 1976).",3
531,"Many and varied reasons have been put forward for this basic element of practice, but they can be summarized under three headings: ideological reasons (the right of a person to decide for himself or the recognition of this as an existential reality), educational and developmental reasons (participation as part of human growth and development, for the individual, the family, the group, the organization or the community), and political reasons (participation as a means to enfranchisement and empowerment, an antidote to alienation)(Ross, 1960; Bernstein, 1960; Katan, 1980; Freedberg, 1989; Rothman, 1989).",3
532,Freedberg (1989) has shown how social workers have applied the principle in different ways at different times.,3
533,"Bernstein (1960) puts forward limitations on self-determination, and shows how it stems from ‘the supreme social work value…human worth’(p. 7).",3
534,"Thus self-determination is not an absolute value, but it is ‘supremely important.",3
535,Only through the rich utilization of this concept can we fully honor the human-worth value’(p. 8).,3
536,Rothman (1989) extends Bernstein's critique and suggests that many social workers use manipulative and directive techniques under the guise of self-determination.,3
537,"He suggests the construction of a continuum of categories, each with its set of conditional factors, in which the practitioner could decide upon the degree of directiveness or non-directiveness needed in a specific situation.",3
538,Almost all the examples he gives for a restriction of client participation are of a community work situation.,3
539,"Defined simply (even simplistically) client participation means that the client system, as a whole or , is part of the action system.",3
540,How can we measure client participation in community work?,3
541,What are the dimensions that can be observed empirically?,3
542,The literature is well developed and offers a wealth of suggestions.,3
543,"Arnstein (1969), Hollnsteiner (1977) and Wandersman (1979a) base typologies on the distribution of power between the establishment and the clients, drawing similar but slightly different levels between the two extremes, and considering other relevant dimensions roles, representation, influence, and the stages of the process.",3
544,"Mogulof (1974) sees a dialectic in which the establishment and the change agent system determine how much participation they will allow, while the client system decides how strong is its desire or demand for participation.",3
545,"The level of participation becomes, therefore, a function of the motivation of the partners.",3
546,"Susskind and Elliot (1981) take a similar line, seeing the relationship between the establishment and the client system as an evolution from paternalism to co-operation via conflict.",3
547,Others prefer a multiplicity of dimensions.,3
548,Cole (1974) describes two major dimensions: the scale of participation and its range.,3
549,"The former delimits the activity involved, the latter the number of participants.",3
550,"Wandersman (1979b) outlines five dimensions: the setting and the scale of the activity, the stage in the process at which participation takes place, the identity and the representativeness of the participants, the level of participation (as described above in Wandersman, 1979a), and the different techniques used by the change agent in achieving participation.",3
551,"Finally, Liron and Spiro (1988) choose three multi-faceted dimensions to examine the participation of clients in the Israeli Urban Renewal Project: authority (how central, final, and comprehensive are the decisions of the participatory steering committees, and how complete is their domination over resources), the influence of the client representatives the establishment and the professionals, and the representativeness of these representatives.",3
552,"All of the dimensions from the literature are measurable, and many of the authors present operative techniques for their measurement.",3
553,"Thus we shall conclude this first section by summarizing six criteria put forward in the literature reviewed above, together comprising a multidimensional and empirical test of the extent of client participation at the community level.",3
554,1.,3
555,LEVELS OF PARTICIPATION,3
556,"The levels will reflect the influence and authority of the different partners, and the distribution of power among them.",3
557,2.,3
558,TYPE AND SCALE OF ACTIVITIES,3
559,In what types of activities or interventions are the levels of participation applied?,3
560,The scale of the activities can be inferred both from the activity type and the level of participation involved.,3
561,3.,3
562,REPRESENTATIVENESS OF CLIENT PARTICIPANTS,3
563,How far do the clients involved in participation represent the complete client system?,3
564,"This question is important whether the client system be a social group, a committee of a functional community or a neighbourhood activist group.",3
565,"In one way or another, the representatives will be compared with the total client system.",3
566,THE ORIGINS OF PARTICIPATION,3
567,Upon what authority do the clients participate and whose initiative was it that launched the participation?,3
568,"Is participation voluntary and welcomed by the clients, or is it demanded of them by the action system, the change agent or even by some extraneous system, as in some parent-teacher associations?",3
569,TECHNIQUES OF PARTICIPATION,3
570,What methods are used to achieve client participation?,3
571,"The different methods will reflect different levels of participation, and show how broad the participatory front is.",3
572,ATTITUDES TO CLIENT PARTICIPATION,3
573,It seems clear to us that all of the above criteria will be enhanced or negated by the way in which the change agent or the action system reacts to participation: what stereotypes do they have of client representatives? do they believe in participation? what expectations do they have of participation and client representatives?,3
574,"Similarly, parallel questions will be asked of the participants, for the clients also bring expectations and stereotypes (of the workers, administration, etc. and of their fellow clients) to participation, a wide gamut of often conflicting ideologies.",3
575,WHAT IS EFFECTIVENESS AND HOW CAN WE MEASURE IT?,3
576,"Social work has begun to evaluate its effectiveness in the last fifty years, and Sheldon (1986) has described two separate waves of reviews and researches.",3
577,"From the 1940s till the early 1970s the question asked was ‘does social work work?’, and the answers given, by Mullen and Dumpson (1972), Fischer (1973 and 1976), and Wood (1978), were generally negative: social work intervention was apparently ineffective.",3
578,"The second wave, from the 1970s to the present day, have limited their attention to the question ‘how effective is a particular program with a particular type of client?’",3
579,"(Reid and Hanrahan, 1982, p. 328), and the answers appear to be positive.",3
580,"Reid and Hanrahan (1982), in a review of twenty-eight studies between the years 1973 and 1981, find that the objectives of the interventions were generally achieved, and so they conclude that ‘intervention carried out by social workers can be effective’(p. 333).",3
581,"Of particular importance to the subject of this paper, they emphasize in their summary that the client in the studies reviewed ‘is engaged as a voluntary collaborator’, and his ‘motivations were directed toward what the social workers were attempting to provide’.",3
582,"This kind of  ‘motivational congruence between practitioners and clients’ was generally missing from the studies in the first wave of effectiveness research, they suggest (p. 338).",3
583,"This implies the connection between client participation and effectiveness that Bernstein (1960)(as quoted above) seems to take almost as axiomatic, and which we would like to demonstrate empirically.",3
584,"Ruben (1985) reviews twelve more research studies between 1978 and 1983, and generally replicates the findings of Reid and Hanrahan.",3
585,"(See also Brawley and Martinez-Brawley, 1988.)",3
586,How is effectiveness defined and measured in these studies?,3
587,Sheldon (1986) points out that ‘effectiveness’ is not absolute: for whom? what? are some of the limitations.,3
588,Thus his definition is ‘a much less ambitious affair’:,3
589,"It implies describing carefully the nature, extent and implications of any problems intervention; saying what it is you might do to alter these and why it would be beneficial to try; describing how best this might be brought about; saying in advance what kinds of public test might be applied to support the view that something worthwhile has been achieved; pursuing a solution, and then defending the results against criticism from peers (Sheldon, 1986, p. 224).",3
590,"However, the literature so far described is concerned almost entirely with social work at the micro level: individuals, families and small groups, much of it using techniques that are of little relevance to community work, behaviour modification.",3
591,Sheldon (1986) suggests that one implication of the research findings is that social workers are more effective on ‘smaller-scale problems’ than ‘large-scale experiments on problems of genuine concern to the community’.,3
592,"Jenkins (1987) describes effectiveness research so far as a ‘limited concept, primarily relating to the intervention process’ and with little validity in the ‘macro area’.",3
593,"Rees (1987) maintains that effectiveness is meaningless without usefulness, and this implies, among other things, political constraints.",3
594,Thus our review of literature must now address those studies specifically concerned with the evaluation of effectiveness in community work.,3
595,"Key and his associates (1976), in an attempt to decide how to evaluate their community project, make a thorough review of evaluation research literature.",3
596,"They emphasize qualitative and quantitative approaches, methods ranging from the rational to the intuitive, and the role of the clients in the evaluative process.",3
597,Hunt (1987) states the dilemma more briefly: the scientific approach may be quite unrealistic.,3
598,"Control groups are not relevant, and important variables can seldom be specified in advance the complexity and dynamic nature of the processes involved.",3
599,"Objectives are usually very general to begin with, and the non-directive nature of the work means that they are defined as  the work goes on.",3
600,"Finally, she asks, ‘when is an outcome not an outcome?’, , how are outcomes defined and for whom: funders? community workers? people/clients? researchers?",3
601,"These studies (and earlier studies by the team of Epstein, Fellin and Tripodi: Tripodi .,",3
602,"1971; Epstein .,",3
603,"1973) lay a basis for the study of effectiveness in community work, but, giving clear, operative and replicable indications of how to measure it, emphasize the problematical nature of the task.",3
604,"Thus, in the spirit of the culture of openness and coherence proposed by Rees (1987), let us consider what might be learned from other applied social sciences, particularly management science.",3
605,"Lewin and Minton (1986) in their comprehensive survey of the literature find no thirteen to management from the year 1911 onwards, each with its own typical effectiveness attributes.",3
606,"Steers (1975), summarizing seventeen research studies, finds various criteria of effectiveness, but the three most frequent ones are adaptiveness, productivity, and participant satisfaction (meaning, , worker, not client participation).",3
607,"He concludes that the effectiveness of a given system should be based on its ability to fit in with the external systems making up its environment on the one hand, and, on the other hand, on its competence in allowing its own sub-systems to fit in with .",3
608,This model is clearly process oriented.,3
609,"Pennings and Goodman (1977) present a systems model that also stresses internal processes: they see effectiveness as the result of coalitions and arrangements between dominant and interest groups, and the satisfaction of the participants from the efficiency of these inner processes.",3
610,"Miles (1980) presents an ‘ecology model’, not dissimilar to the systems models.",3
611,"Dividing previous schools of thought into goal attainment models and systems models (and criticizing both of them), Miles defines organizational effectiveness as ‘the ability of the organization to minimally satisfy the expectations of its strategic constituencies’(Miles, 1980, p. 375), thus demanding both sets of criteria.",3
612,"However, the criteria of effectiveness will change with the different constituencies: different sub-systems will define effectiveness differently, some goal attainment (say the management and the stock holders) and some process (the workers, ).",3
613,"This means that ‘organizational assessment is best conceived of not as a one-shot affair, but as an ongoing process’(Miles, 1980, p. 380).",3
614,"Campbell (1977) too divides organizational effectiveness into two categories: ‘goal-centred’ and ‘natural system’, and he lists no thirty criteria ‘that have been proposed seriously as indices of organizational effectiveness’(p. 36).",3
615,"Probably, therefore, Cameron (1986) is right when, after  summarizing five areas of agreement on effectiveness and three areas of conflict, he concludes that ‘agreement about effectiveness is mainly an agreement to disagree’(p. 544).",3
616,His suggestion is to see competing criteria as both compatible and congruent and to accept that ‘organizational effectiveness is inherently paradoxical.,3
617,"To be effective, an organization must possess attributes that are simultaneously contradictory, even mutually exclusive,(Cameron, 1986, pp. 544–5).",3
618,"Thus successful organizations will have a high degree of role specialization (reinforcing expertise and efficiency) together with a high generality of roles (encouraging flexibility and interdependency), a continuity of leadership alongside of infusion of new leaders, .",3
619,"Our conclusion must be that there are many criteria of organizational effectiveness, some of which are mutually exclusive, yet, paradoxically, these seemingly conflicting attributes are able to co-exist and to work together.",3
620,Most of these criteria are measurable and have been measured in management research in quantifiable terms.,3
621,It remains to be seen to what extent they can be applied to social work.,3
622,"We propose two composite criteria for the measurement of effectiveness, both using variables used in previous research, the specific demands and context of the researcher or practitioner.",3
623,1.,3
624,CLASSIFICATION OF EFFECTIVENESS,3
625,"Using the terms of Miles (1980), we classify effectiveness by ‘goal attainment’(that is goal achievement, productivity, etc.) and ‘systems processes’(adaptiveness, participant satisfaction, inner processes, systems resources, etc.).",3
626,The assessor may use either of these classifications (with whatever sub-groups he or she prefers) or both of them.,3
627,"Both measurements of effectiveness are valid, and the one used will depend upon the purpose of the assessment, the customer ordering the assessment and the audience at which the assessment is aimed.",3
628,An evaluation of effectiveness of a community economic enterprise productivity and profit is legitimate in one set of circumstances; the same evaluation of the same enterprise citizen satisfaction and decision-making processes is equally legitimate in another set of circumstances.,3
629,"If possible, the evaluation will include both types of effectiveness measurement.",3
630,2.,3
631,EFFECTIVENESS EVALUATED BY WHOM?,3
632,Clearly not just the type of evaluation of effectiveness but its essence will be affected by who evaluates.,3
633,"In the example of a factory, completely different assessments may be expected from the board of directors, shareholders, management, workers, and shop-stewards.",3
634,DOES PARTICIPATION LEAD TO EFFECTIVENESS?,3
635,A REVIEW OF LITERATURE,3
636,The amount of published research on this topic is not extensive.,3
637,"The management research field includes many studies on effectiveness, but the only type of participation to be found in them is worker participation, quite different from our topic of client participation.",3
638,"Some of the conclusions from this literature do seem applicable to our topic, and they will be considered at the end of this section.",3
639,"Research on the participation of the public or clients tends to centre around the form of participation involved (inputs) and its effect on the change agent and action systems (processes, ‘thruputs’), but little attention is paid to the results of participation (outputs) , and in achieving the specific goals of the activity involved.",3
640,"Moreover, the conclusions of the studies which do consider the effectiveness of participation are clear or unanimous.",3
641,"Mazmanian (1976), in his evaluation of projects carried out by the Corps of Engineers, and Gilbert and Specht (1977), in their classic evaluation of the Model City programme between the years 1967 — 71, appear to reach a similar conclusion: participation helps process but not goal attainment.",3
642,"Mazmanian finds participation effective in such process goals as leading to public appreciation of the Engineers' work, but not in what he calls ‘product’ goals, increasing public support for the projects or recommending courses of action.",3
643,"Gilbert and Specht show that project workers used client participation effectively in the planning stage, where the process was the main consideration, work was non-directive, and the major skills needed of the worker were interactional in nature.",3
644,"But when they reached the implementation stage, in which their orientation was to concrete tasks and the skills required of them were chiefly technical, then they became more directive and used client participation less.",3
645,"These conclusions appear to have been replicated by York (1989), who finds that community workers express more satisfaction and effectiveness in their short-term projects, which are more directive and task-oriented, than in their long-term projects.",3
646,"However, the conclusions of Gilbert and Specht are indirect and do not necessarily show that client participation in implementation stages is ineffective.",3
647,"As York finds, workers prefer not to involve their clients in short-term task processes, but this may be for a multitude of reasons that of effectiveness: lack of time (client participation is generally time consuming), agency policy and pressure (paternalism), professional socialization and norms, .",3
648,"Only Mazmanian, so far, clearly states that client participation leads to ineffectiveness, and  he does so only for ‘product goals’.",3
649,We should like to know more about how participation was achieved in these projects and what was the nature of the tasks involved.,3
650,"In any case, it is clear that Mazmanian does not deal with social work programmes, and the change agents involved were not social workers.",3
651,"Gittell (1980), in a research study of school-related citizen organizations in three American cities, finds that both lower- and middle-class parent organizations had little effect on educational decision-making, their declared goal.",3
652,"In our terms, client participation was not effective.",3
653,"However, she shows how imperfect was the participation, particularly in lower-class organizations, and also makes clear that some of the objectives were achieved.",3
654,Thus Gittell's data are not conclusive.,3
655,"Rosener (1978) finds much consideration in the literature of participation as an end in itself, and this is relatively easy to evaluate: how many clients participated? what kinds of people? how frequently? how much time did they invest? what were their attitudes (and those of the workers) to participation?",3
656,"However, participation is seldom evaluated as a means to an end, that is effectiveness, she maintains.",3
657,"To do this, two difficult questions must be answered: what are the criteria of effectiveness (goals and objectives) the different participants (citizens, officials, workers)? and how clear is the cause/effect relationship between these goals and participation?",3
658,"Thus Rosener suggests a matrix between ‘knowledge of a cause/effect relationship between participation program and achievement of specified goals and objectives’(complete or incomplete) and ‘agreement on program goals and objectives, whose they are, and the criteria to measure success and failure’(yes or no)(1978, p. 459).",3
659,"But, as Rosener herself points out, examples of complete knowledge and perfect agreement are rare indeed.",3
660,"We learn, therefore, two important lessons: deciding before intervention what our goals and objectives are, if possible a common decision of all the participants (though separate, if not conflicting decisions would be legitimate); and setting criteria and measurement indicators to show the relationship between participation and effectiveness.",3
661,"The first point is undeniable, and few field workers and even fewer researchers would object to it (though its applicability may be complicated by the dynamic development of a project).",3
662,"The second point is more difficult, for how often in the social sciences do we have ‘complete knowledge’ of a cause/effect relationship?",3
663,The aspiration towards some sort of rational understanding of the causal relationship is probably the best we can achieve.,3
664,"Although management science literature on worker participation is of limited relevance to the topic of client participation, some of the recent research on the relationship between worker participation and  productivity sheds light, in our opinion, on the wider topic of how participation leads to effectiveness.",3
665,Erez .,3
666,"(1985) suggest that participation does not cause better performance; they hypothesize that participation in decision making strengthens the level of goal acceptance, and this leads to better performance.",3
667,Thus the causal model is a two-step one.,3
668,"Their two empirical studies, one laboratory and one in the field, partially support their hypotheses: increased goal acceptance leads to more effective performance, and participation is an effective strategy to enhance goal acceptance.",3
669,"They suggest that this may be through the perceived control an individual has over his goals, as compared to that when goals are externally assigned.",3
670,"Miller and Monge (1986), in their ‘meta-analytic review’ of participation, satisfaction, and productivity, in forty-seven articles and book chapters, find two possible models to explain how participation and productivity are linked.",3
671,"The cognitive model proposes a direct causal link: participation brings about enhanced information on goals, and so performance is improved.",3
672,"The affective model, like that of Erez and her associates, is multi-stage: participation fulfils needs, these lead to satisfaction which strengthens motivation, and thus workers' productivity is improved.",3
673,Both of these models are supported by their analysis.,3
674,"They suggest that the models may be linked, and further suggest that the direction of the causal link between participation and satisfaction is not entirely clear: possibly satisfaction leads to participation and not .",3
675,Both of these management research studies stress the complexity of the relationship between participation and effectiveness and of the variables involved.,3
676,"Thus we can use the existing research to help us find our empirical measures for the effects of client participation on effectiveness in social work, but we have not yet achieved our aim.",3
677,"None of the studies presents an operative model (Rosener, in our opinion, comes closest, but her model, as she shows herself, is more heuristic than empirical), and so in the next section a model will be set out and explained the evaluation criteria for participation and effectiveness put forward in the first two sections of this paper.",3
678,We believe the model can be used to answer the question posed in the title of this paper.,3
679,PARTICIPATION AND EFFECTIVENESS: AN OPERATIVE MODEL,3
680,"In the evaluation of the effectiveness of social services and interventions, we have shown the importance of who evaluates, and our model identifies three different systems (on the basis of Gilbert and Specht, 1979, and Pincus and Minahan, 1973) that could be involved in the process:",3
681,1.,3
682,Change Agents — professional and para-professional workers in the change agent system;,3
683,2.,3
684,"Administration, Political and Administrative Establishment — within the change agent system and in the larger systems of which the change agent system is a sub-system, politicians and bureaucrats in local or national government within which the change agent system is located;",3
685,3.,3
686,"Clients — individuals and groups within the client system, those that were part of the action system and those that were not.",3
687,"These, then, are the three groups that will evaluate the effectiveness of client participation, each in its own way and using its own peculiar criteria.",3
688,"Each of the three groups will use the double classification of goal attainment (goal achievement, productivity, etc.) and systems processes (adaptiveness, participant satisfaction, inner processes, systems resources, etc.), as explained above in the summary of the section on effectiveness.",3
689,"Thus the model includes six categories of effectiveness evaluation, two each for all three groups of evaluators.",3
690,They are summarized in Table 1 with examples given of the types of outputs to be expected in each of the categories.,3
691,"The change agents, their professional values, get satisfaction client participation (Bernstein, 1960, although the findings in York, 1989, referred to above, in the third section, may throw some doubt on this).",3
692,"Goal attainment is also improved in the long run: leadership development among the clients is a goal by itself, and the strengthening of client independence will lead to the better preservation of any other outputs achieved.",3
693,"The clients get satisfaction from participation (or, perhaps, participate as a result of their satisfaction), take part in a learning process which enriches them, and identify with a process in which they themselves are involved.",3
694,"They achieve declared or undeclared goals: involvement, legitimization, recognition, prestige, all of which increase their influence among the others in the client system and those in external systems, thus increasing the chances of further and better outputs in the future.",3
695,"The administration and the external political and administrative establishment may see participation as a political end in itself, a means to building coalitions for the political good of their establishment.",3
696,"If participation saves resources (jobs carried out by volunteers, , paid workers), then this is an important output, the public legitimization and support which are likely to accompany client participation.",3
697,"This, then, is the model which seems to us most appropriate for attempting empirically to answer our question: How can we measure the effects of client participation on the effectiveness of social work intervention?",3
698,"Using the six measurement criteria summarized at the end of the section on client participation, we are able to measure the extent to which our clients are participating in the community work project (the independent variable), and the model presented in this section allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of the project (the dependent variable) in a number of different ways.",3
699,CONCLUSION,3
700,In this article we have reviewed the extensive literature on client participation and effectiveness and the limited literature in which the effect of the former on the latter was examined.,3
701,"With the help of this previous research, we propose criteria for the measurement of these two important variables and an operative model to illustrate and to measure how participation can lead to effectiveness.",3
702,"We hope that improved methodology will allow a better evaluation of the relationship between two extremely important values in the social worker's day to day work, and will show that the participation of our clients is not just ideologically based but practically worthwhile.",3
703,"General Practice, Social Work, and Mental Health Sections: The Social Control of Women MICHAEL SHEPPARD",3
704,Michael Sheppard trained in social work at the University of East Anglia and was a social worker in Norfolk Social Services Department.,3
705,"His publications include (University of Sheffield Press, 1990) and (Falmer, 1991).",3
706,SUMMARY,3
707,A survey was undertaken of all referrals for compulsory admission received by a city mental health centre over a one year period.,3
708,The centre receives the overwhelming majority of all these referrals in the city.,3
709,Referrals from GPs were compared with other referrals focusing particularly on women.,3
710,"The results indicate GPs discriminated against women, referring considerably more women than men with less emphasis on major (psychotic) mental illness.",3
711,"The involvement of approved social workers (ASWs) in the assessment process was associated with diversion of many of the women compulsory admission, although even they appeared affected by patriarchal assumptions.",3
712,GPs behaviour sections is consistent with reports about sexist practice in other areas of work.,3
713,"This, however, is particularly grave with sections civil liberties implications.",3
714,"The article concludes that ASWs need be aware of potential sexist GP practice, that their psychosocial perspective is critical to assessment and that ASW training should include gender issues.",3
715,Researchers are beginning to unravel some of the factors significant in the process of assessment for compulsory admission (section assessments) under the 1983 Mental Health Act.,3
716,"Studies have focused on Approved Social Workers (ASWs)(Sheppard, 1990; Barnes .,",3
717,"1990) and the police (Bean .,",3
718,"1989; Bean, 1990; Rogers, 1989).",3
719,"One study has used theoretical and empirical research to provide the foundations for a social work knowledge base assessing social risk (Sheppard, 1990).",3
720,"There has, however, been no focus on the position of GPs and their interaction with ASWs in the assessment process.",3
721,"This article examines general practitioners (GPs) as referrers, and women as the subject of referral for section under the 1983 Act.",3
722,It does so by examining the process of assessment in which the ASW plays a critical role between the initial referral from the GP and the decision to section the woman.,3
723,"This is interesting, both the serious consequences of a mental health section, and concern expressed about sexist practice by GPs in other areas of their work (Barrett and Roberts, 1978; Cooperstock, 1978).",3
724,GPs occupy a pivotal position mental health.,3
725,"Because they occupy key positions in primary care, they are for most people the most accessible caring profession, and psychiatry is considered by doctors to be primarily their occupational territory.",3
726,"Hence they deal with high levels of psychiatric morbidity (Jenkins .,",3
727,"1988; Goldberg and Huxley, 1980).",3
728,"They are likely, therefore, to be the first profession approached by, , relatives, for assessment.",3
729,In many circumstances GPs are likely to be the first professional to decide a section is necessary and initiate the section assessment process subsequently involving ASWs.,3
730,"It is widely recognized that the proportion of women who suffer mental disorders — particularly depression — exceeds that of men (Cochrane, 1983).",3
731,"A variety of possible contributing factors have been put forward: that biological factors make women more vulnerable than men; that women are socially disadvantaged by the roles they are expected to perform, and psychologically disadvantaged by socialization preparing them for these roles; that women express their emotions more readily; and that health professionals are more likely to equate feminine characteristics with ill health (Weissman and Klerman, 1977; Penfold and Walker, 1984; Corob, 1987).",3
732,Feminists make much of the social disadvantage under which women suffer.,3
733,"this disadvantage, and possible GP sexism, the study of GP section referrals and the influence of ASWs in the subsequent process of assessment is significant.",3
734,Compulsory admission in England and Wales is carried out under the Mental Health Act 1983.,3
735,"This is primarily carried out under sections 2, 3, and 4, although section 5 provides for doctor and nurse holding powers, police powers exist under section 136 and courts have powers to direct individuals into hospital (, section 37).",3
736,"Section 2 involves admission for assessment, section 4 for emergency admission for assessment and section 3 for admission for treatment.",3
737,"Admission under these sections, , may be made when a person is suffering from a mental disorder, and such admission is in the interests of the person's (defined as patient) own health or safety or for the protection of other persons.",3
738,"The duration of section 2 may be 28 days and of section 3 six months, although it is renewable.",3
739,"Section 4 may last  72 hours, and may be made only when admission is of urgent necessity and complying with the provisions of section 2 would cause undesirable delay.",3
740,"Application may be made by an ASW or nearest relative although the draft code of practice (Department of Health, 1989) states the former should apply whenever possible.",3
741,"Sections 2 and 3 require two medical recommendations, one by an approved doctor, while section four requires only one.",3
742,Individuals may also be admitted informally (section 131) or not admitted .,3
743,"There is, therefore, a variety of possible outcomes following a referral.",3
744,METHOD,3
745,"The research was undertaken on referrals received by the Psychiatric Advisory Service (PAS) at the Nuffield Mental Health Centre in a medium sized city of about 240,000, with a very small ethnic minority population.",3
746,The Centre is situated in a central location with good transport links to all parts of the city.,3
747,The PAS is well known in the city and receives the overwhelming majority of the section assessment requests received during normal working hours.,3
748,It is staffed by a team of community psychiatric nurses and a team of social workers together with psychiatrists approved under the Act.,3
749,It is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.,3
750,Referrals at other times are received by hours social workers.,3
751,Referrals received from all sources requesting a section assessment over a one year period were included in this study.,3
752,"When the ASWs responded to a section referral, whatever the source, they were asked to complete fully structured questionnaires.",3
753,These had been developed over a one year period and had been fully piloted.,3
754,"Detailed analysis both of the questionnaires and piloting is provided elsewhere (Sheppard, 1990; 1991).",3
755,"The research instruments involved questions about the source of referral, section requested and psychiatric state suggested, if any, in the referral.",3
756,"They involved demographic characteristics age, sex, and marital status; information on psychiatric state and psychiatric disorder; and social problems.",3
757,"Finally, information was provided on who in the patient's social circle was interviewed as part of the assessment process, factors considered in assessment, and outcome.",3
758,"These data, it should be remembered, were provided by the ASW, and in some respects, the presence of social problems, will represent their perspective on the patient.",3
759,"In other respects, outcome, we have unambiguously objective information.",3
760,These questionnaires were completed within the week following assessment.,3
761,"Agency records, which  recorded all referrals, were checked weekly to confirm that ASWs had completed questionnaires where relevant.",3
762,RESULTS,3
763,MALE AND FEMALE REFERRALS,3
764,Altogether 120 referrals were made during the study year.,3
765,Forty (33 ) were by GPs.,3
766,"Of the other 80 referrals 17 were by the family, 13 by psychiatrists, 17 other health referrals, 15 police, nine social workers and nine other referrals.",3
767,"The overall rate of referral was 49.9 per 100,000 population, and for GPs, 16.6 per 100,000.",3
768,"These figures relate to referrals during working hours only, and compare with overall referral rates varying between 19.9 and 102.7 per 100,000 in 42 social services departments studied by Barnes .",3
769,(1990).,3
770,"Although, therefore, quite high, the rate of referral in this study was well within the range for different areas.",3
771,Seventy-five referrals (62 ) were women.,3
772,This is consistent with trends identified by Barnes .,3
773,"(1990), and raises issues of what, if any, social processes are occurring which leave women more frequently identified as candidates for sections.",3
774,The social profile of the women differed markedly from that of the men in a number of respects.,3
775,Men tended to be younger than women: 58 of men compared with 49 of women were aged under 45.,3
776,A number of differences are significant.,3
777,Table 1 shows significant differences in marital status.,3
778,"Markedly more men than women were single, while considerably more women were married or cohabiting.",3
779,"More women than men had children, although the small proportion of men with children confirms their limited involvement in family relationships.",3
780,Men were more disadvantaged in other ways.,3
781,Only 43 of women were unemployed or in families where no member was employed compared with 56 of men (p=0.024).,3
782,Sixty-seven of men compared with 42 of women were on state benefit excluding child benefit and retirement pension (universal to parents and the retired elderly)(p=0.013).,3
783,"Housing condition also showed greater, but not significant, male disadvantage.",3
784,"When divided into two — stable residence consisting of council and owner occupied housing, and unstable consisting of private rented, lodging, and hostel accommodation and no fixed abode — 76 of women lived in stable accommodation compared with 63 of men.",3
785,"Marked differences, however, are not evident in the ‘processing, of these people.",3
786,"Eighty-nine of men and 84 of women were previously known to the psychiatric services, indicating longstanding problems.",3
787,In just over half male and female referrals no specific mental disorder was identified.,3
788,Following the section assessment 84 of males and 95 of females were considered to suffer some kind of mental disorder.,3
789,"Over 70 of both groups were considered psychotic, with rather more men schizophrenic and rather more women suffering affective psychosis.",3
790,"Frequently, then, an unspecific referral was subsequently considered a psychosis.",3
791,On average the ASWs identified more social problems for women (2.12 per case) than men (1.6 per case).,3
792,"Twenty women (27 ) but only five men (11 ) had marital problems, while only one man (2 ) compared with ten women (13 ) had child care problems, both differences show just below significance (taken as p<0.05).",3
793,"Women, then, had more social problems, particularly connected with familial responsibilities.",3
794,"Outcome (Table 2) was generally similar for both groups, although considerably more men were placed on section 3 and rather more women on section 2.",3
795,"The former, which is more draconian, may reflect the longer term perceived treatment needs of the men.",3
796,This may be related to a relative lack of social stability: being more frequently single and in less permanent accommodation.,3
797,"Overall, then, the main differences were in the social profile, and a greater number of social problems in women.",3
798,Difference in outcome may be related to different social profiles.,3
799,This still leaves the issue of the process by which more women were referred.,3
800,WOMEN AND GP REFERRALS,3
801,The impact of GPs on the sex composition of referrals is profound (Table 3).,3
802,Exactly a third of referrals were made by GPs.,3
803,"However, the overwhelming majority of GP referrals were women, compared with only just over half the other referrals.",3
804,Indeed GP referrals account for nearly all the excess of female over male referrals.,3
805,"Examination of outcome, furthermore, is intriguing.",3
806,"The difference between male and female GP referrals was noticeable: five of the eight males referred (63 ) were sectioned, compared with only 12 (38 ) of female referrals.",3
807,"However, compared with the 70 of women referred from other sources (39) who were sectioned, the number of female GP referrals sectioned was significantly lower (p=0.011).",3
808,"This indicates a significantly greater diversion of women, following ASW assessment, generally with a psychiatrist, compulsory admission when referred by GPs.",3
809,An excess of GP referrals over other referrals of women informally admitted was matched by an excess of female over male GP referrals who were informally admitted.,3
810,Two initial observations may be made.,3
811,"This combination of data — an excess of GP over other referrals of women, together with a significantly greater likelihood of diversion of women referred by GPs compulsory admission compared with other female referrals — suggests apparent discrimination GPs against women.",3
812,"Second, the role of specialist  professionals — ASWs and psychiatrists — appears significant in enabling women referred by GPs to avoid compulsory admission.",3
813,Outcome is shown in more detail in Table 4.,3
814,This shows a noticeable excess of women referred by GPs over other female referrals who were not admitted .,3
815,Informal admissions are also interesting.,3
816,Noticeably more women referred by GPs were admitted informally than either male GP referrals or other female referrals.,3
817,"This group involves women who were considered to need assessment or treatment, but where compulsion was not considered necessary.",3
818,"This suggests the significance of specialist workers in two possible ways: either preventing compulsion where there was insufficient risk to the patient or others, or persuading those who would otherwise have been sectioned to enter hospital informally.",3
819,"Bean's (1980) typology of doctor — patient interaction showed that, under the 1959 Act, voluntary admission occurred when there was agreement between doctor and patient on the patient's sick role or where, although agreement did not exist, the patient acquiesced and accepted this role.",3
820,Compulsory admission occurred where the doctor ascribed the sick role but the patient did not accept it or did not react .,3
821,"The nature of the ASW involvement suggests that they too would be involved in this process (Sheppard, 1990).",3
822,Referrals by GPs where outcome was informal admission were consistently characterized by familial disruption: indeed only two of these cases were referred where the woman's behaviour drew attention to her in the wider social environment outside the family.,3
823,"The noticeable familial disruption occurring in other cases is particularly interesting because it reflects social role expectations of women, where the primary role is that of homemaker, family manager, and housewife (Oakley, 1981).",3
824,"Thus, informal admissions were characterized by a combination of mental ill health and transgression of traditional social role expectations.",3
825,"Three examples, drawn from the ASWs’ account, indicate the different types of familial disruption.",3
826,The first type —— involved a woman in her thirties who was considered to be   suffering from schizophrenia.,3
827,She was very overactive and had not slept for three nights.,3
828,"She was pacing up and down in the house, was hostile to other family members and was shouting at voices that she (and no-one else) heard.",3
829,"She was paying little attention to her normal ‘household duties’ child care, shopping, and looking after the house.",3
830,"She had two young children, aged five and seven, and the ASW expressed concern for their welfare.",3
831,"Her husband, who usually worked 200 miles away, had been forced to return to look after the children.",3
832,The second example — a woman considered to be depressed — involved from her usual role.,3
833,"In this case, a 45 year old woman with a large family had recently moved into the area.",3
834,She was described as having become ‘withdrawn and introverted’.,3
835,She was not going out and was communicating very little with her immediate family.,3
836,"She had two adult children who lived nearby, and had stopped visiting them as was her usual custom.",3
837,"She had stopped undertaking her usual tasks within the home, was eating very little and had taken to her bed a few days previously and had not re-emerged.",3
838,The third example involved .,3
839,This was a woman in her twenties who was considered to be schizophrenic.,3
840,"There was, the ASW, a ‘continuing crisis at home’.",3
841,"She had suffered paranoid delusions for a number of months, that the house was electronically ‘bugged’, that there was a camera in the television watching her and that she was being followed.",3
842,Her husband was described as having difficulty coping with her.,3
843,She had left home and was refusing to return the ‘weird things’ that were going on.,3
844,"When her husband tried to reason with her she refused to accept what he was saying, and had begun to suspect that he was involved in some way (in the bugging).",3
845,The lack of section 4 admissions was the availability of an approved doctor at the Centre: the approved doctor is frequently the most difficult of the two doctors to get hold of under sections 2 or 3.,3
846,"There was, amongst those sectioned, considerably less use of section 3 among women referred by GPs than either male GP referrals or other referrals of women.",3
847,"It is not immediately obvious why this should be the case, but this provides evidence of a less restrictive response to GP referrals of women, since section 3 applies for six months and section 2 for 28 days.",3
848,Section 2 is for assessment and may more frequently be expected where an individual had no previous psychiatric history.,3
849,"However, the proportion of men and women previously known to the psychiatric services was exactly the same (84 ) for both GP and other referrals.",3
850,"Overall then, not only were female GP referrals sectioned less frequently than other female referrals, but when sectioned they were less frequently the lengthier section 3.",3
851,PROBLEMS,3
852,We can explore these differences further problems.,3
853,"Individuals' psychiatric state was divided into ‘definite cases’, ‘borderline or threshold cases’, and ‘not cases’, where no psychiatric disorder was present.",3
854,The ASW was asked which of these were considered applicable to the assessed individual.,3
855,Few differences emerged between the relevant groups: 88 of male and 84 of female GP referrals plus 86 of other female referrals were considered definite.,3
856,"There was a tendency, however, for female GP referrals to involve less major mental illness than others, although differences were not significant.",3
857,"The individual diagnostic categories were broadly divided into three: neurotic, psychotic, and alcohol or drug problems, which could be neurotic or psychotic.",3
858,Of those considered mentally ill rather more female GP referrals (23 ) than other female referrals (8 ) and no male GP referrals were considered neurotic.,3
859,"All male mentally ill GP referrals were psychotic, as were 82 of other female referrals, compared with 77 of GP female referrals.",3
860,"The concept of primary problem was used by the ASW to identify, from the whole range of psychiatric and social problems noted in each case, which was considered to be the main or primary problem.",3
861,"There was a slight tendency for GPs' female referrals to have fewer psychiatric primary problems: 78 , compared with 86 of other women and 88 of male GP referrals.",3
862,"Psychotic primary problems also had a slightly lower profile amongst female GP referrals: only 60 came into this category, compared with 74 of other females although similar to male GP referrals (62.5 ).",3
863,Social problems were divided into thirteen categories.,3
864,The ASWs were asked to indicate which of these each individual suffered and which of these they considered to be severe.,3
865,Female GP referrals averaged 2.28 social problems compared with 2 for other women and 1.87 for male GP referrals.,3
866,"While, however, female GP referrals averaged more severe social problems per case (1.34) than male GP referrals (1.12), this was less than other female referrals (1.44).",3
867,"Nonetheless, there appears to be a different ‘threshold’ which triggers GP female referrals compared with other referrals, with greater emphasis on neurotic problems, fewer psychiatric primary problems and more social problems  than other referrals.",3
868,"GPs, therefore, more frequently resorted to section referrals for women with neurotic and social problems than is evident in other referrals.",3
869,"The pattern of social and mental health problems indicates GPs were more sensitized to mental health and illness, and that this played a significant part in choice of referral.",3
870,"The more frequent presence of social problems among female GP referrals is interesting here because these might be expected to raise the possibility of alternative referral (, to a social worker) and management.",3
871,"However, these GPs seemed to be seeking a medical solution to these women's problems.",3
872,"Second, the solution they sought had serious implications for civil liberties since sections would effectively deprive individuals of their liberty.",3
873,"This search for a medical solution, then, may present a serious threat to civil liberties.",3
874,We may pursue this through a further examination of primary problem.,3
875,"The detailed classifications of mental health and social problems were divided into six: neurotic, psychotic, alcohol — drugs for mental health; and practical, emotional and relationship, and physical ill health for social problems (Fitzgerald, 1978).",3
876,"Amongst GP referrals, seven (22 ) of the women, but no men had emotional or relationship problems as primary.",3
877,"These involved marital, loss or separation, social relations or isolation, and criminal behaviour problems.",3
878,"Although not significant, only women had relationship primary problems.",3
879,"However, this is particularly interesting when related to outcome.",3
880,No woman with emotional or relationship primary problems was sectioned.,3
881,"Indeed, six of the seven women falling into this category were not admitted , and one was admitted informally.",3
882,"In contrast only 15 of all other GP referrals (and 12 of other female referrals) were not admitted, while over half were sectioned.",3
883,"This suggests GPs were attempting to deal, both medically and compulsorily, and only in the case of women, with problems which at subsequent assessment were considered to be primarily about social relationships.",3
884,CONSULTING OTHERS,3
885,"One expectation of the ASW is that others in the patient's social network — relatives, friends, neighbours — should be consulted to help build a picture of the individual and their behaviour (DHSS, 1983; Department of Health, 1989).",3
886,"When women were referred by GPs, others were consulted significantly more frequently (88 ) than women who were referred by other referrers (61 )(p=0.02).",3
887,This may be because the GP's previous contact with the family facilitated such contact or that a balance to the GP's assessment was  sought.,3
888,In relation specifically to GP's referrals others were consulted with exactly the same frequency whether male or female referrals.,3
889,"Consulting others, furthermore, had no impact on outcome, consultation occurring in 88 of sectioned and 87 of not sectioned GP referrals.",3
890,"However, did the person consulted have an impact on outcome? , what was the impact of male family members?",3
891,Table 5 shows significant differences in outcome for women a male family member was consulted by the ASW.,3
892,Women not admitted were markedly more likely to have a male family member consulted.,3
893,"Where sections were undertaken, males were more frequently consulted where section 2 was undertaken than section 3.",3
894,"The picture was similar sectioned women where female family members were consulted, but interestingly females were not generally consulted where women were not admitted.",3
895,"Consulting both male and female family members was therefore associated with briefer section periods, but only males were associated with non admission.",3
896,"Indeed, in relation specifically to women not admitted, the difference between male and female members consulted was significant (p=0.034).",3
897,"There were also significant differences between GP and other referrals, specifically women not admitted.",3
898,"Of the nine women referred by GPs who were not admitted, eight cases (89 ) involved consultation with a male family member.",3
899,"Of the eight other women not admitted only two cases (25 ) involved consulting a male family member (Fisher exact probability test: one tail 0.013, two tail 0.015).",3
900,"There was little difference, however, between GP and other   referrals in the rate of male or female consultation section 2 and in female consultation non admissions.",3
901,"These data indicate that consultation with either male or female family members can have the effect on women sectioned, of producing less lengthy compulsory admission.",3
902,"It indicates also, however, that male family members can have an impact on non admission where females do not, and that this was significantly greater with GP referrals.",3
903,"This suggests, perhaps, two possibilities.",3
904,"The mere availability of a family male is reassuring, giving the ASWs and others assessing greater confidence that the woman can remain in the community.",3
905,"Second, the male family members, because they are male, are given a credibility — and hence power — to influence non admission not given to female members.",3
906,"However, this power is primarily relevant to GP referrals.",3
907,"This strongly indicates that it is only males who have the status and power to provide, in the eyes of the relevant professionals, a credible challenge to the GP.",3
908,"The Memorandum to the Act (DHSS, 1983) indicates a number of factors to be taken into account by ASWs.",3
909,"The woman's past history of mental disorder, family relations and support and medical opinion were all considered both with GP and other referrals in a minimum of 93 of cases.",3
910,"The woman's financial and material circumstances were considered less frequently with GP referrals (28 ) than other referrals (49 ) as was the case with non familial social supports (GP referrals 53 , other referrals 65 ).",3
911,"The referred woman's wishes were, however, considered more frequently in GP (78 ) than other referrals (63 ).",3
912,"Although these differences were not significant, there was less concentration on social factors relating to wider social supports and financial-material circumstances with GP referrals, suggesting, in the face of the GP's referral, and despite section diversions, less preparedness by ASWs to examine social factors which may challenge the GP's definition.",3
913,What power did the woman herself have to influence the course of events?,3
914,Table 6 shows the relationship between outcome and the extent to which their wishes were considered.,3
915,This shows significant differences: women's wishes were taken into account most frequently   when they were informally admitted or not admitted.,3
916,"Interestingly, women's wishes were more frequently considered with the longer section 3 than section 2 admissions (15 of 17 cases compared with 15 of 23 cases).",3
917,"Taken together with consultation with family members, this suggests that, when sectioned, family members had a greater impact on the length of admission.",3
918,"However, there was little difference between GP and other referrals where women were not sectioned.",3
919,Only one of the 20 women referred by GPs did not have her wishes considered.,3
920,The wishes of not admitted women referred by others were in all cases considered.,3
921,The trend was similar with men.,3
922,"These data suggest that, for both men and women, outcome significantly depended on whether their wishes were considered, or, alternatively, that their wishes were taken more seriously in less serious cases.",3
923,In either situation the mental health state of the woman may be significant.,3
924,PROFILE OF FEMALES REFERRED,3
925,What of the social profile of women referred?,3
926,Women referred by GPs were generally younger than other women: 59 of GP and 42 of other referrals were aged between 16 and 44.,3
927,More women referred by GPs were married (47 ) or single (28 ) than other referrals (35 married and 19 single).,3
928,"However, 22 of GP referrals and 42 of other referrals were widowed, divorced, or separated, and hence had lost their partner.",3
929,Rather more (28 ) women referred by GPs than other women referred (12 ) had children.,3
930,About three quarters of both groups lived in owner occupied or council housing.,3
931,"Rather fewer GP referrals of working age (54 ) lived in a unit with no employed members than other referrals (65 ), while fewer GP (33 ) than other women referred (48 ) received state benefit child or retirement benefit.",3
932,"GP referrals only, more women (59 ) than men (38 ) were aged 16 to 44 and more women (63 ) than men (43 ) were in more stable council or owner occupied housing.",3
933,"More men (57 ) than women (28 ) were single, and more women (47 ) than men (29 ) were married.",3
934,Only one man (13 ) had children compared with nine women (28 ).,3
935,The proportion unemployed was similar.,3
936,"Although differences are not significant the overall profile indicates that female GP referrals were more frequently married, aged between 16 and 44, had children, and lived in more stable housing.",3
937,"GPs were using section referrals as a method of social control, it was more frequently upon these women.",3
938,DISCUSSION,3
939,"The difficulty of research in this area has meant that, with one notable exception (Barnes .,",3
940,"1990) very large scale studies have not been undertaken, whether on the 1959 or 1983 Acts.",3
941,"It is also relevant that these were referrals to one mental health centre, although the lack of ASWs in district teams meant that these represented practically all the daytime referrals to ASWs.",3
942,"Although we must recognize the limits of a study focusing on one city, the results are, perhaps, startling, and of considerable interest.",3
943,The pattern of results raises major concerns about the role of GPs in using section referrals as a method of social control of women.,3
944,Its significance lies in the seriousness of the consequences should a woman be inappropriately sectioned.,3
945,Enforced hospital entry would be accompanied by a loss of normal civil liberties.,3
946,Under section 2 or 3 this involves detention respectively 28 days or six months.,3
947,"They may be forced to take medication (mind altering drugs), although consent or a second opinion is required three months after the beginning of treatment (section 58).",3
948,"Although some protection is provided by appeal to the Mental Health Review Tribunal or nearest relative right to discharge, in practice both are rarely undertaken or successful, the total sectioned.",3
949,Referral for compulsory admission is clearly an issue of power.,3
950,"It involves generally male professionals (GPs) raising the issue of deprivation of liberty for women, frequently married and aged under 45, and, compared with other referrals, likely to have children.",3
951,"The excess of these women in GP referrals, it might be argued, represents the excess of women with children seen in general practice (Shepherd .,",3
952,1966).,3
953,"However, this fails to account for various other elements in the process of assessment.",3
954,"Following assessment, involving ASWs and, at times, approved doctors, fewer women then men referred by GPs or other women referred were actually hospitalized.",3
955,The incidence of informal admission was also higher in GP referred women.,3
956,"Although considered assessment or treatment, these women did not require compulsory admission, with the attendant limits on civil liberties.",3
957,"We may legitimately ask why, given GPs' professional concern with mental health, this should be the case to a greater extent than with other — frequently lay — referrals.",3
958,It strongly suggests that GPs' concern for civil liberties was considerably outweighed by their concern for treatment: a conceptual inability to distinguish between treatment need and treatment requirements combined with curtailment of civil liberties; something more sinister.,3
959,"The data indicate a connection between  adequate assessment of social factors and civil liberties, commented on elsewhere (Sheppard, 1990), and considered further later.",3
960,"They ascribe a significant role in this respect to mental health specialists, particularly ASWs.",3
961,The distribution of problems is also revealing.,3
962,"Women referred by GPs were more neurotic and less psychotic than the comparison groups, and had more social problems.",3
963,GPs showed a different threshold triggering their female compared with their male referrals.,3
964,More telling still is that where ASWs considered relationship problems primary no woman referred by GPs was sectioned.,3
965,"A further important aspect of the assessment process was the significance of ASW consultation with male family members, associated with section 2 more than section 3 and to a greater degree with GP than other referrals with non admission.",3
966,"This creates a strongly patriarchal image: of women as the hapless subjects where, in the face of the (professionally powerful) GP referral, it was through ASW consultation with males that a potential section was averted, or the duration of a section was shortened.",3
967,"A possible (relatively) benign explanation might be presented for GPs' failure to pursue a non compulsory route: that women, whose conventional role involves running the home and family, would be less willing to go into hospital precisely their feelings of responsibility for others in the home.",3
968,"However, the evidence contradicts this.",3
969,"First, of those not sectioned, a considerable proportion were not hospitalized : mentally ill, they were not, following assessment, seen to fit the criteria for compulsory admission.",3
970,"Second, there was a marked trend for (female) referrals by GPs subsequently considered to be about social relationships not to be sectioned.",3
971,"Indeed, overall women referred by GPs showed greater evidence of neurotic, psychotic, problems and a greater predominance of social problems.",3
972,GPs were clearly treating women differently and utilizing a different threshold or trigger for female referrals.,3
973,"Finally, of those informally admitted, the majority of women were contributing to the running of the household.",3
974,"They were either disruptive, or withdrawn, or simply not around to be involved in familial or household responsibilities.",3
975,"This is, , a not surprising by-product of some forms of mental illness and some women, despite this, might still argue that they were needed at home.",3
976,"However, a sympathetic and patient GP would not have required great imagination to point out the disparity between such claims by these women and their ability to perform family and household tasks based on the evidence of their behaviour.",3
977,"Certainly, if this was what was necessary, it did not subsequently prove beyond the wit of the ASW or psychiatrist to point this out.",3
978,"As one of the ‘specialists’ involved in assessment GP referral, ASWs clearly played a significant part in diverting these women from possible compulsory admission.",3
979,"To what extent, however, does this reflect the work specifically of the ASW the psychiatrist?",3
980,"First, ASWs took responsibility for decisions diverting individuals from compulsory admission.",3
981,"Where individuals referred by GPs were subsequently informally admitted or not admitted , in no case would the ASW have preferred compulsory admission.",3
982,"There is, furthermore, considerable evidence in this study of social factors being of some significance.",3
983,This is most clearly the case in referrals where relationship problems were considered primary and where no compulsory admission took place.,3
984,"Although we cannot be categorical the cases in this study, other research has indicated that psychiatrists rarely trouble themselves with the social circumstances of individuals referred, and are rather preoccupied with evidence of mental disorder (Bean, 1980).",3
985,"In this research social information, psychiatric diagnosis, was not considered by psychiatrists to be central to their task, although they were aware of the influence of social factors on psychiatric symptomatology.",3
986,"They therefore made little attempt, family history, income, education, and criminal history, to collect information on social circumstances.",3
987,"Although this research involved the 1959 Act, unlike social workers, additional training has not been required of psychiatrists under the 1983 Act.",3
988,"It is reasonable to suppose, therefore, that social factors influencing decision making, the ASW played an important part.",3
989,"Third, a number of significant dimensions analysed reflect, specifically, the ASW the medical role.",3
990,"This is particularly the case social and familial factors considered, and the members of the individual's social network interviewed, as part of the assessment process.",3
991,"Section 13 (2) of the Act specifically requires the ASW to consider ‘all the circumstances of the case’ and these factors were specifically mentioned in the Memorandum (DHSS, 1983) as a guide to ASW assessment.",3
992,"Where, , members of the patient's social network were interviewed as part of the assessment process, these interviews were specifically carried out by the ASWs.",3
993,Finally the research is based on information collected from the ASWs themselves.,3
994,"Thus, , the definition of primary problem in each case comes from the ASWs, reflecting their perspectives on individuals assessed.",3
995,"To that extent the results reflect the basis upon which ASWs made decisions, which frequently involved diversion of GP referrals from compulsory admission.",3
996,"However, the ASW role was not wholly positive: ASWs were significant in diverting women from compulsory admission, and injecting a  psychosocial perspective which appears to have contributed to this diversion.",3
997,"Nonetheless, the significance of ASW consultation with male relatives, and a tendency to examine social factors which may have challenged GP definitions less than with other referrals are rather less positive.",3
998,These serious findings may be linked with other aspects of GP behaviour.,3
999,The first may be related specifically to GPs' training as medical practitioners.,3
1000,"Huntington (1981) identifies two significant elements of GP occupational culture: a biophysical (psychosocial) frame of reference, and an action (holding) orientation.",3
1001,"Although medical education may pay some attention to the social sciences in the pre-clinical curriculum, the highest priority is still overwhelmingly given to the ‘hard sciences’.",3
1002,"This bias is reflected in practice, where medicine's primary concern is with the biophysical consequences of diagnosis and treatment, not its social causes and consequences (Freidson, 1970).",3
1003,"The result is an emphasis on the subject matter of general practice as a biomedical phenomenon, concomitantly ignoring or minimizing the need for psychosocial knowledge or skills.",3
1004,"This, Huntington (1981) thinks, is allied to an action orientation: a predilection for ‘doing’ traceable back to teaching hospitals, where the dominant image of the emergency prevails.",3
1005,"The legacy in the GP is a tendency to take action for its own sake — doing something is better than doing nothing (Freidson, 1970).",3
1006,The potential for ill considered actions is great with sections.,3
1007,"Viewed from the subsequent assessment, GPs mostly correctly identified individuals with mental illness.",3
1008,"However, many were referred for compulsory admission where they were subsequently not admitted, or admitted informally.",3
1009,"In the latter case, could the GP not have discussed this with the individual first? why resort to possible compulsory powers?",3
1010,"Second, by resorting to a medical route (and a compulsory one at that) for dealing with problems of women, frequently having a major psychosocial element, their behaviour indicated a limited frame of reference for viewing these problems — a predominantly biophysical perspective.",3
1011,"Bean (1980), the 1959 Act, makes some points about psychiatrists which may be extended to GPs.",3
1012,He suggests that their orientation is towards the perceived therapeutic needs of the patient their legal rights.,3
1013,"This does not mean that legal rights are entirely ignored, but it does mean the scope for making decisions primarily based on illness is increased.",3
1014,"Sheppard (1990) has described a ‘mental health orientation’ in section assessments, with which the behaviour of these GPs is consistent.",3
1015,This involves the balance of emphasis placed on the mental health status of the patient versus the social risk they present (to the health or safety of  the patient or protection of others).,3
1016,A mental health orientation places greater emphasis on the former to the detriment of the latter.,3
1017,"This mental health orientation leads to a more pessimistic outlook on patient needs — they not only require treatment, but it is assumed that it must be compulsory — and there is a tendency towards a ‘presumption of risk’— that the presence of mental illness makes the situation inherently risky.",3
1018,"This is consistent with the behaviour of these GPs: placing mental illness to the fore when the problem may be primarily social, and seeking a compulsory voluntary route.",3
1019,"When ASWs made assessments, social factors frequently took a high profile, as social mental health problems were considered primary.",3
1020,"Where relationship problems were primary no women were sectioned, a mental health problem was present.",3
1021,"The injection of a more psychosocial perspective, therefore, diverted some women sections, and even informal hospitalization.",3
1022,There are also characteristics which show specific disadvantage to women.,3
1023,"It is the involvement of the ASW, and possibly the approved doctor, which rescues some women from possible compulsion.",3
1024,Why should GPs show discrimination against women? and why emphasize married women with children?,3
1025,"There is evidence of sex role stereotyping by mental health professionals, and GPs .",3
1026,Broverman .,3
1027,'s (1970) well known study showed that sex role stereotyping placed women in a disadvantageous position.,3
1028,Characteristics considered healthy for an adult (sex unspecified) were primarily those considered healthy for men those considered healthy for women.,3
1029,The healthy person was also the healthy man.,3
1030,"This leaves women in a catch 22 ‘whether to exhibit those positive characteristics considered desirable for men and adults and have their ‘femininity'’ questioned…or to behave in the prescribed feminine manner [and]accept second class adult status' (Broverman .,",3
1031,"1970, p. 6).",3
1032,"By implication, the healthy female is not the healthy adult.",3
1033,Some characteristics Broverman .,3
1034,"(1970) found identified by clinicians as characteristic of healthy women were: being more submissive, less adventurous, less objective, more emotional, more excitable in minor crises — strange characteristics for a healthy person!",3
1035,Yet these are reflections of popular expectations.,3
1036,Penfold and Walker (1984) comment that a girl is trained to consider her primary achievement is to be a wife and mother.,3
1037,"She is led to believe that she will be happy and fulfilled if she serves others, devoting herself to the needs of her husband and children.",3
1038,"She provides for the physical needs of the family, she is its emotional organizer, mediator of feelings, with a responsibility to dampen and absorb confrontations and generally keep the family running smoothly.",3
1039,"The GP in this social world — far from being an expert — is no more than a layperson, with the same prejudices as others.",3
1040,"Barrett and Roberts (1978) showed how GPs tended to see middle aged women patients primarily their family, and men primarily their occupation.",3
1041,"Where a woman fails to perform her expected role properly the GP tends to see her ‘either the conventional models of their own social background (she must adjust to her situation), or individual personal inadequacy (that she must be referred to the psychiatrist)’(Barrett and Roberts, 1978, p. 46).",3
1042,"However, extensive research shows that the stereotypically female role of mother, other social disadvantage, is actually associated with vulnerability to depression and broader distress (Brown and Harris, 1978; Richman, 1974, 1976; Moss and Plavis, 1977).",3
1043,The relative emphasis on neuroses in female GP referrals is interesting in this context.,3
1044,The problem appears in medicine's successful expansion of its empire.,3
1045,"Doctors are consulted on environmental, technical, religious, or psychiatric matters, which are frequently beyond the scope of medical education.",3
1046,"Since medical advice has the force of moral imperative, health and illness are concepts expanding to ever increasing parts of human existence (Zola, 1975).",3
1047,The effect is the creation of doctors as social control agents.,3
1048,Two levels may be identified from previous discussions.,3
1049,"First, there is advice maintaining an unrewarding and demoralizing existence.",3
1050,Barrett and Roberts (1978) found GPs extensively ‘smoothed away surface anxieties’(p. 42) and adjusted women to a life located totally in the home.,3
1051,"In so doing they legitimated and endorsed the , and fulfilled an ideological function of agent of disguised social control.",3
1052,Doctors frequently used their medical-moral language to offer a set of prescriptions based ‘on the conventional wisdom of their own social milieu’(p. 42).,3
1053,The second level of social control relates to the use of drugs.,3
1054,The use of psychotropic drugs is a pervasive dimension of the medicalization of problems of living.,3
1055,"These drugs are prescribed in vast quantities, and far more frequently for women than men (Cooperstock, 1978).",3
1056,"Valium is a case in point (Koumjian, 1981): an extensively prescribed drug to deal with anxiety and stress.",3
1057,"It can, however, have severe withdrawal symptoms, including dizziness, nausea, vomiting, panic, anxiety and depression.",3
1058,"Valium prescription is frequently related to an individual's social functioning: the person's ability to live social ideals, social expectations and the physician's judgement are factors in a pseudo objective diagnosis.",3
1059,"Valium, therefore, is frequently prescribed for problems loneliness and marital discord, the latter interestingly considerably more evident in female than male section referrals in our study.",3
1060,"Valium use, furthermore, focuses on individual malfunctioning: social and economic problems are dealt with in a framework of a medical model of relief of individual distress, alleviating symptoms operating in a social context which may require familial or wider social change.",3
1061,"Indeed, the conditions of medical practice support these approaches.",3
1062,The lack of emphasis on psychosocial factors in training leaves GPs without sensitivity or skills in these areas.,3
1063,"Second, lack of time is a factor.",3
1064,"There is clear advantage — time use — in prescribing drugs engaging in more time consuming counselling, or confronting the social origins of the problems.",3
1065,"Anyway, GPs are not trained for either of these.",3
1066,"Finally, advertising of tranquillizers has provided an explicit message: to use drugs in controlling conflict, producing a less demanding and more compliant patient, or for dealing with life crises or social problems.",3
1067,"A third, and more sinister, level of social control has been identified here: the use of compulsory admission.",3
1068,This takes medical ideology to an extreme point.,3
1069,There is an unequal knowledge relationship between GP and patient — the GP is expert and ‘definer’ of the patient's problem.,3
1070,The balance of power is also unequal in that GPs exert pressure for compulsory admission of women who could otherwise be admitted informally.,3
1071,This involves a medical solution GPs seek medical care in a hospital environment.,3
1072,"Finally, such medical care will generally involve invasive drug therapy.",3
1073,Our evidence suggests section referrals may be used by GPs as an extreme form of social control of women.,3
1074,"It also indicates that specialists, particularly ASWs, play a significant role in preventing unnecessary sections, hence guarding women's civil rights.",3
1075,"Even they, however, were not unaffected by patriarchal assumptions.",3
1076,"We have here further evidence of the need for ASWs to assume a social risk mental health orientation (Sheppard, 1990).",3
1077,"ASWs are, by their training, the best equipped to examine social dimensions of section assessments.",3
1078,"Given the apparent pervasiveness of GPs' behaviour, it is vital, given their primary training in the complexity of the social world, that, first, ASWs are aware of issues of gender and sexism, and second that they are prepared to challenge medical power threatening women's civil rights.",3
1,HOW TO RECOGNIZE FOSSILS,4
2,Fossils are not rare.,4
3,"We have seen how millions of fossils may make up the rocks themselves, crammed together layer after layer to form formations thousands of feet thick.",4
4,The present land surface is a thin skin a thick record of the past preserved in the rocks.,4
5,Once scientists began to collect the record of past life they soon came across the problem of how to order and arrange the huge variety of fossil forms they recovered.,4
6,"to understand what they had found they needed to classify the fossil organisms into particular kinds, more or less similar, to impose an order on what would otherwise have been a vast and chaotic mass of different and apparently unrelated relics.",4
7,The urge to order the natural world appears to be an innate characteristic of human beings: ‘a place for everything and everything in its place’.,4
8,"But classifying animals and plants, living and fossil, is more than just an attempt to find a convenient way of slotting them into different categories, like stamps in a stamp album, for neatness and convenience.",4
9,The classification of the natural world is supposed to reflect the great ordering that itself gave rise to the variety and diversity of animals and plants that are alive today: the process of evolution.,4
10,"Animals that look similar are classified together, and not only that, they are also closely related in an evolutionary sense (or put another way, they share a common ancestor).",4
11,"So when we look at the grimacing gestures of a chimpanzee and wonder at the almost ludicrous parallels with our own behaviour this is just part of a whole host of behavioural and anatomical similarities that show without doubt that we ought to be classified with the apes (we are all of us primates), and that we share a distant ancestor with our diminutive caricatures.",4
12,"Evolution has driven man and the chimpanzee further our shared ancestral species, and in evolutionary terms the chimpanzee is as advanced as we are, although man dominates by virtue of numbers and adaptability.",4
13,"Few people are offended today, as they were in the last century, by the thought of man and the chimpanzee being classified together by virtue of a common ancestor which has been extinct for probably three million years!",4
14,But enough family likeness remains to make the chimpanzees' tea-time a most popular attraction in zoos all over the world.,4
15,A word of caution here: not similarities indicate relationships with evolutionary significance.,4
16,"Some similarities can be misleading, because animals can superficially resemble that are not closely related in an evolutionary sense.",4
17,Often these resemblances are the product of a similar mode of life.,4
18,"Both tortoises and armadillos are animals that carry around their own suit of armour, and at first glance we might think they were related.",4
19,"But further investigation shows that tortoises are cold-blooded reptiles that lay eggs, while armadillos are in many respects typical warm-blooded mammals bearing their young alive.",4
20,Obviously tortoises and armadillos cannot be classified together their similarities.,4
21,When classifying fossils even more care is necessary because we have not got as much evidence to go on as with living animals.,4
22,We cannot see directly whether a fossil animal was warm or cold-blooded when alive; often the evidence is indirect and depends on careful study of little bits of bone.,4
23,The palaeontologist is like a detective trying to reconstruct a full story from a few  fragmentary clues.,4
24,He must be careful not to follow any ‘red herrings’ that will result in him classifying his fossil on the basis of ambiguous similarities.,4
25,"He must distinguish snakes from eels, tortoises from armadillos, on the basis of the bones presented to him.",4
26,"To do this, he must have thorough familiarity with the living fauna, because the information on living animals is so much more complete.",4
27,We shall see in the next chapter how carrying comparisons with living animals far can result in curious and inaccurate pictures of the past.,4
28,Distantly related species may come to resemble closely.,4
29,"Slow worm (), snake () and amphisbaenid (), probably all descended from different ancestors, and reached their similar shapes along separate evolutionary pathways.",4
30,"The number of species of animals and plants living today runs into millions, and similar numbers of species have probably lived on earth for part of the earth's history.",4
31,"Perhaps it is fortunate that the fossil record preserved only a fraction of the truly stupendous total number of species that must have lived since the Cambrian, for otherwise the scientists' task to catalogue 600 million years of life would be an impossible one.",4
32,"It is not surprising that new fossil species are discovered daily, and indeed the amateur collector has a good chance of finding a new species of fossil, if he looks hard enough and learns to recognize what he has found.",4
33,"There must have been an increase in the number of different kinds of animals and plants since the Precambrian; , the conquering of land alone gave rise to a multitude of new opportunities for the colonizing organisms, resulting in an increase in the total number of species.",4
34,"Within the marine environment itself some palaeontologists believe that the overall richness of the marine fauna was established early on, say by the Silurian period, and that there has not been a great increase in the total number of species living in the sea at any one time since then, although the of organisms inhabiting the sea have changed many times.",4
35,"And there have been several major episodes of extinction (Chapter 6), when the cast of characters in the sea changed almost totally.",4
36,"Although the number of  species may have been approximately the same in marine environments for the last 300 million years or so the kinds of fossils have changed repeatedly, , , in marine limestones of Silurian age the shelled brachiopods may number dozens of species, whereas in similar looking limestones of Eocene age no brachiopods can be found, but there may be as many species of gastropods of kinds unknown in Silurian rocks.",4
37,"Even by the beginning of the Cambrian period, when fossils start to become easy to find and many different kinds of animals had acquired preservable hard parts, it is possible to classify the fossils found in the rocks into broadly similar groups.",4
38,"Nearly all of these groups correspond with major divisions of living animals, so the broad base of classification was established by the Cambrian.",4
39,"These major groups continued to evolve throughout the following 600 million years, and they include the distant ancestors of our living fauna.",4
40,"Not all the major living groups of organisms were present in the Cambrian, however, because the colonization of the land did not take place for another 200 million years, and so there were obviously no direct ancestors of land plants around, or of most of the land animals with which we are familiar today.",4
41,"The major groups into which we can fit almost all fossils from the Cambrian onwards, and all the living fauna, are called (singular:).",4
42,"To identify any animal properly, the first stage is to determine to which phylum it belongs.",4
43,"even the phyla themselves originated from unknown ancestors, and they all ultimately derived from the first living cell.",4
44,"Fossil evidence for some of this early history is shrouded in obscurity, hidden in the vast stretches of Precambrian time, but as is shown in Chapter 7 more evidence is being discovered each year.",4
45,Some of the answers are only now coming to light as we find out more about the structures of the proteins that go to make up living cells themselves.,4
46,"By the time organisms had become sophisticated enough to have hard parts, evolution had already defined the phyla, and the great natural framework for classification had been almost completely constructed.",4
47,At the opposite end of the scale from the phylum is the smallest unit of classification usually used for fossils: the .,4
48,"To be strictly accurate a species can be defined precisely only in living animals, where it refers to populations that can interbreed under natural conditions, and which produce offspring that are capable of further reproducing their kind.",4
49,"In practice, many species are recognized by having some peculiarity of shape, behaviour, plumage, colour , that reliably set them all other similar species.",4
50,"Obviously we shall never know whether fossil species were capable of interbreeding until somebody invents a time machine, and we can go back and see for ourselves!",4
51,"So our fossil species are defined in a rather practical way, as showing some consistent difference or differences from all other related species.",4
52,"the patchy nature of the fossil record many species (particularly of large vertebrate animals) are known from only one specimen; some of these are of almost inestimable value, which is why museums have to take good care of their material.",4
53,Every species has a unique scientific name.,4
54,"The species are ‘christened’ when a scientist describes them for the first time, illustrates their peculiarities and publishes the name in a scientific journal.",4
55,The species name has two words:is a familiar example.,4
56,"The names are usually derived from Latin or Greek —‘’ means ‘tyrant lizard’and ‘’‘king’so the animal is appropriately described as King of the tyrant lizards:is the , unique to this species.",4
57,"There may be other dinosaurs, which are similar to , but belong to another species.",4
58,These may be included in the same but will be given a different specific name.,4
59,"Some species are named after their collectors, so if our new species of were collected by a Mr Jones it might eventually be christened .",4
60,"Incidentally, the generic name always starts with a capital letter, and the specific name with a small one, it is named after Jones.",4
61,In this chapter typical examples of the kinds of fossils most commonly encountered are illustrated by beautiful specimens.,4
62,"Very few fossils have everyday names, and so the scientific name is used.",4
63,Once a few have been mastered it is surprising how quickly the most ponderous sounding scientific name acquires a familiar ring.,4
64,"The scientific name has the great advantage of being the same all over the world, so the language of nomenclature is a truly international one.",4
65,Between the species on the one hand and the phylum on the other there are a whole series of intermediate categories of increasing  inclusiveness.,4
66,"Several genera (plural of genus) may be grouped together in a , several families together in a , and the superfamilies themselves are clustered into , two or more of which combine to make the phylum.",4
67,"It all sounds rather complicated, but it does serve a useful function in ordering the almost countless number of species in the most economical way.",4
68,"All the species within any of the units of classification descended from a single, ancestral species.",4
69,"We need not worry about families or superfamilies in this book, but classes often correspond to everyday groups of animals.",4
70,"In the phylum Mollusca — the molluscs which include the majority of sea animals with shells — the class Gastropoda includes all the snails, and the class Bivalvia all the clams (mussels, scallops, etc.).",4
71,"Many of the most familiar fossils, like the trilobites, are classes within larger phyla.",4
72,"Plants are classified in much the same way as animals, but just to make things difficult the largest units of classification are not generally called phyla but ‘divisions’.",4
73,"Many of the plants familiar in the garden — Dahlia, Chrysanthemum, Fuchsia — are generic names which have come into common language.",4
74,The fossil record of plants is rather patchy compared with that of some animal phyla.,4
75,Partly this the broad level classification of plants is still being argued.,4
76,"We will now examine the commonest and most important kinds of fossils, the kinds that the reader will be able to find when he starts a collection.",4
77,"The groups of organisms described have certain special peculiarities that set them all others, and once these features are recognized the group to which the fossil belongs can be confidently identified.",4
78,"Each group is illustrated in the plates by a typical species, but all the groups contain many species, and any specimen the reader is likely to find will probably differ from the one chosen for illustration in several details.",4
79,"Most accounts of the different kinds of fossils start with the simplest organisms and work towards the most complex, often ending somewhat selfishly with man.",4
80,"This can give the impression of a simple evolutionary tree: single cells to many cells, shellfish to fish, and then land vertebrates.",4
81,This is not correct.,4
82,"Although single-celled organisms are obviously simpler than complex animals like ourselves, many single-celled organisms have continued to evolve actively since they lived in the ‘primaeval soup’.",4
83,"It is known that some of the unicellular organisms in the sea today are only one or two million years old (very little in geological terms), in fact they are probably as young as man himself!",4
84,Very simple and very complex organisms have lived side by side for a long time and both have evolved together.,4
85,"True ‘living fossils’ are really rather rare, and the term can be applied to both simple and highly complex organisms that have outlived the time when the earth was populated with many more of their kind.",4
86,"It is easier to describe simple organisms first and move on to complex ones but this is just a convenience of arrangement, and we will follow this procedure here.",4
87,"Some of the most important fossils are extremely tiny: these will be discussed in a later chapter, and what follows is concerned with the forms that can be recognized from hand specimens.",4
88,When they are first chipped the rock such fossils will often be partly concealed by matrix.,4
89,"To identify them it is usually essential to clean off most of the enclosing rock, otherwise one can be misled by superficial resemblance.",4
90,The rule is never to try such cleaning in the field — it nearly always results in a pile of rubble and a frayed temper.,4
91,THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF FOSSILS AND HOW TO RECOGNIZE THEM,4
92,SINGLE-CELLED ANIMALS — PROTOZOA (Colour plate 2),4
93,"A large and heterogeneous collection of organisms are grouped in the Protozoa, including all those animals that can lead an autonomous existence as a single cell.",4
94,"Most are microscopic, and many have no skeleton and therefore lack a fossil record.",4
95,"The flexible amoeba, which is the protoplasmic ‘blob’ of popular imagination, is a familiar protozoan without much potential for fossilization.",4
96,"A few protozoan groups secrete hard (shells) which are very common fossils, but again most of these are too small to be easily spotted in the field.",4
97,"They are of great geological importance, however, and we shall return to them later in this book.",4
98,Such testate protozoans have a record extending back to the Cambrian.,4
99,"A very few protozoans secrete skeletons of (for a single cell) gigantic size, and these also occur in such numbers that they form conspicuous and common fossils.",4
100,Particularly in rocks of Eocene age the coin-like are important as rock builders.,4
101,"Nummulites are  known from England, but they are most numerous in the Mediterranean and eastwards, where they form limestone formations of great thickness.",4
102,The pyramids of Egypt are constructed of limestone blocks in which the species is conspicuous (opposite p. 64).,4
103,"Nummulites are a giant kind of foraminiferan, an important group of rock-forming organisms as far back as the Carboniferous (and with ancestors in Cambrian rocks), and which still form deep sea oozes today.",4
104,Most foraminiferans require a microscope for their study.,4
105,Another group of giant foraminiferans flourished particularly in the Permian period: these are the ,4
106,"being about the size and shape of a coin, the fusulines are spindle-shaped, with a round cross-section tapering at both ends; fusuline limestones again form thick rock sequences, particularly in Russia and the Orient.",4
107,"Both fusulines and nummulites are divided into many small chambers internally, and details of their internal structure are used to classify them.",4
108,"Both groups seem to have flourished in exceptionally warm, shallow seas in the tropics of the Tethyan region.",4
109,"THE SPONGES — PHYLUM PORIFERA (Colour plates 1, 3)",4
110,"The sponges are an important group of many-celled organisms, with the individual cells specialized for particular functions but rather loosely aggregated.",4
111,Some sponges have the property of being able to ‘rebuild’ their colonies of cells if they are mashed up.,4
112,"Marine sponges have a long fossil record from the Cambrian onwards, and at many localities they are abundant enough to be important rock formers.",4
113,"They have been prominent reef-building organisms too, often bryozoans.",4
114,Not all sponges contain hard parts capable of being fossilized.,4
115,"The skeletal elements of those with hard parts are fine, often branching elements called .",4
116,"The spicules may be only loosely associated within the sponge tissues, or may be more or less fused to form rigid skeletons.",4
117,"Two major divisions of sponges are distinguished on the composition of the spicules: the glass sponges have a skeleton composed of silica, one of the few examples in nature where this material is used as a basis for a skeleton, while the calcareous sponges use calcium carbonate for their spicules.",4
118,"Both kinds have Cambrian representatives and both flourish today, the glass sponges being especially numerous in deep-sea environments.",4
119,"The sponge skeleton is highly variable in shape: many are cup or flask shaped, others spherical or cauliflower-like, while some form flat plates folded together, or are encrusting.",4
120,A successful group of sponges has taken to boring into the shells of other organisms.,4
121,"In detail, sponges are distinguished by the form of the spicular structure, and the ways these combine to form the skeleton, the overall shape.",4
122,"Although sponges are widely distributed in the fossil record they are particularly numerous and easy to collect in Cretaceous rocks in Europe and North America, where dozens of well-preserved species have been described.",4
123,"Sponges are often preserved inside flints, which were originally deposited as hard layers within the Cretaceous chalk.",4
124,"As they are much more resistant to weathering than the enclosing chalk, the flints remain behind when the chalk is eroded away.",4
125,"Flints containing sponges may be incorporated into younger sediments (they are then known as ), and it is not unusual for such flints to be dug up in suburban gardens around London — a long journey from the Cretaceous seas.",4
126,"The calcareous sponge from the Cretaceous of Berkshire, England.",4
127,"This sponge with a calcite skeleton was obtained from a gravel, an unusual type of rock in which to find fossils It is a broadly cup-shaped sponge, rapidly expanding from a narrow base.",4
128,"The minutely porous external surface is covered with irregular bumps. number of species of this genus have been reported from Cretaceous rocks, and related genera occur back to the Triassic.",4
129,"Species related to this one occur in France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland.",4
130,Sponges vary in size and shape.,4
131,The specimen shown has a height of 7 cm.,4
132,"Specimens from unconsolidated gravels are not difficult to clean, any adherent sand grains being easily removed using a stout pin.",4
133,"CORALS AND RELATED ANIMALS — PHYLUM COELENTERATA (Colour plates 4, 5, 6, 9)",4
134,"The coelenterates are a varied group of organisms with cells organized into definite  tissues, a mouth surrounded by tentacles, and a stomach.",4
135,"The tentacles are arranged in a circlet about the mouth, and the coelenterates are typified by such symmetry.",4
136,"The majority of coelenterates have a jelly-like consistency, and the group includes the familiar jellyfish and sea anemones, the smaller hydroids commonly kept in schoolroom fresh water tanks.",4
137,"Coelenterates come in two main designs: they are either attached with the tentacles surrounding the mouth waving like an animal flower in the water (), or free floating with the tentacles hanging down, often as fine as hair ().",4
138,Coelenterates have stinging cells which they use to paralyse their prey.,4
139,"It is surprising to find that the soft-bodied jellyfish have any fossil record , but in fact they have the longest one of the phylum.",4
140,"Casts of the stomach cavities have been described from Precambrian rocks in many parts of the world, and many different Precambrian jellyfish have now been named.",4
141,"It   is certain that the seas of 600 to 1000 million years ago swarmed with drifting medusae, just as they do .",4
142,These free-floating coelenterates are therefore both primitive and ancient.,4
143,"Some groups within the coelenterates have developed the ability to secrete a hard skeleton, of which the most important are the corals (Class Anthozoa).",4

145,The sponge skeleton has weathered a limestone.,4
146,Unweathered specimens are sometimes difficult to see on the rock surfaces.,4
147,"This sponge superficially resembles a living bath sponge more than the other sponges in this book, being bun-shaped, with a minutely pitted external surface.",4
148,species are known from a number of localities in the Permian and Carboniferous of .,4
149,This specimen has a diameter of 7 cm.,4
150,To obtain a hand specimen we rely on the differential weathering of the sponge and the matrix.,4
151,Some related forms are better studied in polished section like the corals.,4
152,"Section across a typical rugose coral (, Carboniferous)",4
153,A coral is essentially a sea anemone which supports its body by a skeleton of calcium carbonate.,4
154,"This first happened early in the Ordovician (some believe even earlier), and there were simple polyps in the Cambrian and Precambrian from which the corals evolved.",4
155,The secretion of a skeleton gave the corals a great advantage over many other coelenterates; supported thus they could overcome the lack of rigidity of their soft tissues and grow large.,4
156,Many coral species form branching colonies in which hundreds of individual polyps live their own houses.,4
157,Other forms remain — a single polyp.,4
158,"From soon after their inception colonial corals started to live together in large masses with one or many species forming large, mound-like, wave resistant structures — coral reefs.",4
159,Many organisms corals also contribute to the construction of the reef.,4
160,Fossil reefs are one of the prime sites to look for fossils of many different kinds besides the corals themselves.,4
161,Corals can be divided into several major groups.,4
162,"In the Palaeozoic, corals looking generally similar to living reef corals may be only distantly related, if , to our present day fauna.",4
163,"These corals can be solitary, or massive in large reefs; in either case their skeletons are composed of the form of calcium carbonate known as .",4
164,"The finest details of the skeletal structure are well-preserved, and the corals can be cut and polished, or studied in thin sections (p. 57).",4
165,"The detailed structure of the individual plates that combine together to build the skeleton are the basis for the classification of the corals, the general form.",4
166,"The most obvious of these building elements are plates arranged radially, looking like the spokes of a bicycle wheel in section ().",4
167,In rugose corals the septa usually have a basic four-rayed symmetry in each corallite.,4
168,Rugose corals are common fossils in rocks of Ordovician to Permian age.,4
169,Alongside the rugose corals low cushions or branching masses of a different kind of calcite coral are often found.,4
170,"These have much smaller corallites usually only a millimetre or two across, and the septa typical of rugose corals are absent or inconspicuous.",4
171,These are the corals (Colour plate 5).,4
172,Both rugose and tabulate corals are extinct.,4
173,"Devonian corals,.",4
174,These silicified specimens have been weathered the rock.,4
175,"They are small, simple corals with a gently curved form.",4
176,Note the deep cup which was occupied by the (the living coral animal) in life.,4
177,"Corals with this simple form are known from Ordovician to Carboniferous rocks, but there are differences in detailed structure.",4
178,has numerous species in the Devonian of Europe and North America.,4
179,Length of the whole coral is about 3 cm.,4
180,"Corals looking superficially very like the rugose ones are found in Mesozoic and younger rocks, and are important on reefs today (corals).",4
181,"Their calcium carbonate skeletons are composed of the mineral , chemically the same as calcite, but with the atoms arranged in a different way.",4
182,The septa in these corals are often arranged about a six-fold symmetry they are fundamentally different from the Rugosa.,4
183,"Oddly enough, although they are younger than the rugose corals, the aragonite composing them does not preserve very well, and it is easier to find beautifully preserved examples of the older Rugosa.",4
184,"Scleractinian corals are found in small numbers in Triassic rocks, and are abundant in Jurassic, Cretaceous and younger rocks, particularly in past and present tropical regions.",4
185,"Jurassic reef coral,This massive coral is now composed of calcite It has been recrystallized, because in life it was composed of the mineral aragonite — chemically the same as calcite, but with a different crystal structure.",4
186,The matrix is a yellow limestone common in the European Jurassic.,4
187,"Rounded, massive coral composed of individual corallites with about ½ cm diameter.",4
188,I he septa that line the edges of the corallites are here very short.,4
189,The little cups occupied by the polyps in life have been exposed by the weathering.,4
190,"There are a number of species related to this one in coral reefs and clumps of Jurassic and later age The specimen is from Nattheim, Germany; related species of occur in Jurassic limestones in Europe, eastwards into Asia Minor, and in the US.",4
191,Diameter of the entire colony is about 10 cm.,4
192,"THE GRAPTOLITES — PHYLUM HEMICHORDATA (Colour plates 7, 10)",4
193,"The graptolites are an extinct group of colonial organisms, with a geological record extending from the Cambrian to the Carboniferous.",4
194,"For many years they were regarded as colonial coelenterates, but it is now certain that they are unrelated to the jellyfish and their allies, and in fact are distant cousins to a small group of tube-dwelling organisms with little fossil record, which belong to the minor phylum Hemichordata.",4
195,Hemichordates are a primitive group that probably share a common ancestor with the chordates (including vertebrates).,4
196,The graptolites swarmed in the seas of the Ordovician and Silurian periods.,4
197,"They are usually preserved as flattened impressions, which retain little of their finer detail.",4
198,"The impressions generally show a serrated edge like a saw, each ‘tooth’ being the crushed tube () that housed an individual of the colony ().",4
199,"The colonies vary widely in shape: some are shrub-like, with numerous slender branches, others have only a few, or even a single branch.",4
200,"The bushy ones (Order Dendroidea-dendroid graptolites) are the more primitive, and were generally rooted to the sea floor.",4
201,"The few-branched forms, which include the Order Graptoloidea or planktonic graptoloids, were derived from the dendroids at the base of the Ordovician and were successful and prolific until the early Devonian.",4
202,"They then disappeared, to be survived by their more primitive bushy relatives.",4
203,The number of branches and the arrangement of   the thecae are important in their identification.,4
204,The graptoloids are one of the important groups used in dating rocks.,4
205,"They evolved rapidly and spread widely, and with a little experience a glance at an assemblage of graptolites on a shale surface can be used to determine the approximate age of deposition of the rock.",4
206,"Most of the later graptolites had only a few branches and, in the Silurian, species with only a single branch tend to dominate the assemblages.",4
207,One advantage of graptolites is that they occur predominantly in former oceanic environments — the deeper water shales or limestones discussed in Chapter 3.,4
208,Their preservation in inner shelf habitats is much more unusual — although not unknown.,4
209,"Whether the graptolites were not living near shore, or whether the conditions were not right for their preservation, are questions that have excited some argument.",4
210,"Whatever the explanation, other organisms, like trilobites or brachiopods, were more numerous in such sites, and have been used to date the rock sequences in the absence of graptolites.",4
211,"Eight-branched graptolite,Ordovician.",4
212,"This graptolite has eight equal branches, each lined with many tiny tubes in which the individual animals of the colony lived, although most of the microscopical details have been destroyed.",4
213,species are very widespread in the early Ordovician rocks.,4
214,Some species have very slender branches.,4
215,"This species is found in the eastern United States, Texas, Britain, Canada and Australia.",4
216,The diameter of the colony is 6cm.,4
217,"Brachiopod () and bivalve mollusc () compared, showing difference in symmetry when viewed sideways, reflecting fundamental internal distinctions",4
218,"BRACHIOPODS — PHYLUM BRACHIOPODA (Colour plates 8, 11, 12)",4
219,A first collection of marine fossils will almost inevitably include a brachiopod or two.,4
220,Brachiopods have one of the longest histories and one of the best fossil records of any invertebrate.,4
221,"They are already present in early Cambrian rocks and are still with us today, although living brachiopods tend to be rather inconspicuous in shallow waters.",4
222,But during the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic they occurred in such profusion in inshore sediments that they are frequently important components of the rocks in which they are found.,4
223,"Brachiopods have two valves, and this gives them a superficial resemblance to bivalved molluscs.",4
224,"The drawing below shows that bivalves and brachiopods really differ in fundamental symmetry, and the differences in the shell reflect even more profound ones in the internal, soft anatomy.",4
225,"Brachiopods have probably always filter-fed, living off small organic particles brought on currents.",4
226,The particles are harvested by a covered in cilia — which serves the dual purpose of both creating a current and catching the food.,4
227,"Most brachiopods were attached to the substrate by a stalk, and the hole through which the stalk entered the shell can often be seen on the fossils.",4
228,This method of food-gathering and the inactive mode of life may seem sufficiently dull for us to anticipate that the brachiopods would have changed little in their long history.,4
229,It is true that one brachiopod —— is one of the most famous ‘living fossils’.,4
230,"-like species, looking much like the living form, can be found in rocks as old as Ordovician.",4
231,"But the other brachiopods have been far from evolutionarily inactive — they have gone through several major proliferations and diversifications, and suffered dramatic major extinctions .",4
232,"In the Ordovician and Silurian periods they became adapted to life in most marine environments, but were particularly numerous in shallow water habitats, in some cases forming whole banks, as mussels do today.",4
233,Although generally small (and hence easily collected) some species grew to 1O cm long or more.,4
234,"Some brachiopods are smooth, but   many became corrugated or ornamented with course or fine ribs.",4
235,"The margins of the valves are often wavy, and deeply folded in other species.",4
236,Long spines on the exterior of the shell were developed especially during the Carboniferous.,4
237,"Even more profound changes happened in the internal structures of the brachiopods, partly those concerned with supporting the lophophore — these changed from simple loops to complex ‘doubled back’ structures, or to fantastic spirals and whorls — all presumably designed to increase the ways of food-gathering, and its efficiency.",4
238,Quite complicated tooth-and-socket hinges were developed between the valves.,4
239,"Although the variety of brachiopods in the Jurassic and Cretaceous is somewhat less than in the Palaeozoic, they are still very abundant and varied fossils.",4
240,"It has been suggested that their slow decline in the last I00 million years or so has been caused by the commensurate rise in diversity of filter-feeding bivalve molluscs, which ousted them from their former habitats.",4
241,It is an attractive idea but one difficult to prove; in any case many of the greatest successes of the bivalves have been in life habits that the brachiopods adopted burrowing and swimming free for example).,4
242,"Brachiopods fall into two major classes; the more primitive have shells composed of calcium phosphate plus organic material and hinge development is imperfect — hence their name, inarticulate brachiopods.",4
243,Inarticulates can be recognized on the rock from their shiny lustre.,4
244,is one of the best known genera.,4
245,Inarticulates were numerous in the Cambrian and Ordovician periods.,4
246,"The other class, the hinged brachiopods (Articulata) have shells composed of calcium carbonate, and they comprised more varied and abundant group as fossils.",4
247,Though their long history from the early Cambrian to the present different groups of articulate brachiopods rose to prominence only to decline.,4
248,As with other invertebrates the combination of brachiopod types in an assemblage gives a quick clue to the age.,4
249,Modern studies rely particularly on the internal structures for their identification: some brachiopods with similar exteriors can have very different ‘insides’.,4
250,"But the overall shape of some kinds is distinctive enough for quick recognition — the large spiriferid brachiopod shown on Plate II is unlikely to be confused with any other, and brachiopods of this type are abundant in the Carboniferous limestone.",4
251,Above all it is the sheer variety and abundance of brachiopods that give shallow water Palaeozoic assemblages of fossils their distinctive ‘feel’.,4
252,The brachiopod is a common species on this slab of Ordovician age.,4
253,These brachiopods are preserved in a distinctive way.,4
254,The rock surface is covered with both internal and external moulds.,4
255,No trace of the original shell material remains.,4
256,"The enclosing matrix is a fine-grained sandstone, and the original calcite shell material has dissolved away to leave impressions of the shells on the sandstone.",4
257,This sort of preservation is very common in European Ordovician and Silurian rocks.,4
258,The fine radial ribbing is characteristic of many such brachiopods; internal moulds show the impressions of strong hinge teeth (showing as hollows on the rock surface).,4
259,"Species like these are abundant in rocks of Ordovician age, often forming shelly bands.",4
260,"This species is from Near Meifod, Wales, but similar species are very widespread.",4
261,"Precise identifications are difficult, and require expert knowledge.",4
262,The rock specimen is 20 cm across.,4
263,"Jurassic spiriferid brachiopod,.",4
264,"This elegant brachiopod is characterized by its broad shell, thrown into folds at its margin.",4
265,The hinge line is wide.,4
266,Faint concentric growth lines can also be seen.,4
267,The species shown here is from the Lias rocks of England and its close relatives may be found worldwide.,4
268,It does not exceed 3cm in length.,4
269,"Fossil lamp shell,, Pilocene of East Anglia, England.",4
270,"The specimen shown has both its original valves preserved, and looks today much as it did when it had just died.",4
271,"This is a particularly large brachiopod, as its Latin name ‘’ implies.",4
272,"One of its valves is larger than the other, and that valve has a circular opening at its apex, through which a fleshy stalk passed which served to attach the animal during life.",4
273,It lacks the strong ribbing seen on many brachiopods.,4
274,Species superficially resembling may be found all over the world in rocks going back to the Jurassic period.,4
275,"Its close relatives, in the Tertiary rocks, are rather rare.",4
276,Adult shells are 10 cm or more long.,4
277,SEA MATS — PHYLUM BRYOZOA (Col. plate 13),4
278,"Bryozoans are an important group of colonial organisms which form encrusting mats on other marine shells or rocks, or branching, leaf-like hummocky colonies on the scale of a few centimetres.",4
279,"Their colonies can often be seen on seaweeds stranded on the shore, where they resemble a fine, white net attached to the darker weed.",4
280,"They are rather common fossils from the Ordovician onwards, and their small size can be abundant enough to be important as rock-formers (especially in limestones).",4
281,"Bryozoans found as fossils have calcium carbonate (calcite) skeletons that have a high chance of being preserved, and the fossil forms seem to have been exclusively marine (some living bryozoans live in  fresh water).",4
282,"A microscope is essential for their proper study, but even with a hand lens a glance at the surface of a bryozoan colony reveals a number of tiny openings.",4
283,"Each one of these openings, was in life, occupied by an individual of the colony , a minute animal with tentacles covered in cilia, that entrapped passing microorganisms and edible particles.",4
284,Larger colonies would have hundreds of individual zooids.,4
285,"In more advanced bryozoans of the Mesozoic to Recent individual zooids have become specialized for particular functions — some have become totally modified to curious, snapping structures looking remarkably like miniaturized parrot heads, which may function to prevent the settling of larvae of unwanted alien organisms on the bryozoan colony.",4
286,"The zooids themselves are, or course, not preserved as fossils — we only have their vacated homes.",4
287,But from a study of detailed thin sections through the colonies we can deduce about the growth of colonies of bryozoans long since extinct.,4
288,Although they were filter-feeders like the graptolites the bryozoans have not taken to free-floating planktonic existence — they are characteristic benthic organisms.,4
289,"They are divided into a number of groups on the basis of details of structure of the individual ‘boxes’ that housed the zooids, and the construction of the colony.",4
290,It is always worth examining the surfaces of fossils like brachiopods or sea urchins to see if the fine matted or delicately branching colonies of bryozoa are preserved on their surfaces — they are easily overlooked.,4
291,"Other bryozoan colonies are more immediately conspicuous, particularly the stout, twig-like branches of the Palaeozoic trepostomes, which can make up thick limestone beds, and formed their own ‘reefs’, or the large, often net-like colonies of the ‘fenestrellids’ common in the Upper Palaeozoic.",4
292,"A relative of the latter, the curious, screw-like is shown on p.65.",4
293,Bryozoans are quite commonly preserved as internal moulds — the calcite skeleton is dissolved away leaving only the sediment fillings of the chambers once occupied by the zooids.,4
294,"In this case they can present a different appearance, a host of little tubes combining together into branching twigs or nets.",4
295,Such preservation is usual in sandy or silty rocks.,4
296,"The variety of colony structure in the bryozoan exceeds that even in the corals, and ranges from compact humps to cobweb-like branching colonies of exceptional delicacy, and their small size in no way detracts from the beauty and variety of form they display.",4
297,MOLLUSCS — PHYLUM MOLLUSCA,4
298,"The molluscs are one of the most varied, successful and numerous of the invertebrate phyla.",4
299,"Thousands of living species occupy every marine habitat from the shallowest to the deepest abyss, and, as every gardener knows who has tried to protect his vegetables against marauding hordes of snails and slugs, they have been remarkably successful in making the transition from sea to land.",4
300,"the most primitive molluscs lack a shell, but the most diverse groups, and those that concern us here, have well-developed hard parts that are readily fossilized.",4
301,"Molluscs have the lower part of the body developed as a muscular , which may variously function locomotion, digging or swimming.",4
302,"The molluscs were ultimately derived from a soft-bodied creature somewhat like the living flatworms, but the acquisition of hard parts happened very early on, low in the Cambrian of before, and by the Ordovician the important living classes were well established.",4
303,"A few molluscs, like the slugs and octopuses, have secondarily lost their shells, having developed other means of protection.",4
304,"As with the other phyla, the great span of geological time has seen different groups rise to prominence, decline, to be replaced by others.",4
305,But unlike the brachiopods the molluscs are probably as diverse today as they have ever been.,4
306,Measured by their total living weight (biomass) molluscs are one of the most important groups in the whole marine biosphere: the swarms of squid in the oceans are the match of any species of fish.,4
307,"The level of organization achieved by the most advanced molluscs, the octopus, is the most intricate and sophisticated of any invertebrate: one cannot over-estimate the importance of the Mollusca in shaping the patterns of marine communities we see today.",4
308,"Different molluscs fill most of the possible ecological roles available to marine organisms: some are voracious hunters, others graze on algae or feed directly on organic material in muddy sediments, others again are filter-feeders.",4
309,"The great majority of molluscs have a minute, planktonic larval stage, a small ciliated object bearing no resemblance to the adult, that drifts as part of the plankton until ready to settle and assume its mature form.",4
310,"Thus even bottom-dwelling molluscs can be dispersed widely   over long distances, and are quick to colonize vacant sites that appear in the ocean (new volcanic islands like Surtsey, ).",4
311,"Most molluscs are small, a few centimetres long and some are really tiny, but a few species have attained considerable dimensions.",4
312,"The most famous (or notorious) is the giant squid at 15 m or more in length, but some of the extinct ammonites and nautiloids were of similar dimension, and were the largest shelled animals ever to have lived.",4
313,"Fossil glass sponge,from the Devonian of New York.This exceptionally large beautiful sponge is preserved in full relief in a fine sandstone.",4

406,"The valves are composed of calcium carbonate, are quite strong in most species, and hence easily fossilized.",4
407,Between the valves a springy ligament keeps the valves in a gaping attitudes — the position used for feeding.,4
408,"If danger threatens powerful muscles can snap the valves tightly shut, and once a bivalve has closed itself in this way it can be very difficult to force it open — it has ‘clammed’ up.",4
409,"the strong muscles leave scars on the interior of the shell at the places to which they were attached (usually two in each valve), and these muscle scars may also be seen on fossil shells.",4
410,"To make the the hinge strong and efficient there are usually complex arrangements of teeth and sockets there, and the arrangement of these articulating devices is very important in identifying the different kinds of clams.",4
411,"So it is important to find the internal structures in fossil bivalves, as in the brachiopods.",4
412,The clams use their foot for digging and movement generally.,4
413,The group has adapted to a range of marine and fresh water habitats where they are often filter-feeders.,4
414,"Their fossils often occur gregariously as they lived, forming beds largely composed of fossil shells.",4
415,"Many living species burrow into sand or mud, sometimes to a considerable depth — these species maintain contact with the sea long , tubes that permit the passage in and water and bring to the animal both the necessary oxygen and the small organic particles on which it feeds.",4
416,Other species are attached to rocks tough threads () that enable them to hang on even in turbulent situations; mussels can colonize even the most inhospitable rock surfaces in this way.,4
417,A few bivalves have become free-swimming — such pectinids can escape predators rapidly by ‘clapping’ their valves together.,4
418,"Still others have taken to burrowing into wood or even into limestone, and fossils of these curious animals can be found lying in their home-made burrows (p. 21).",4
419,"With such a wide range of adaptations it is not surprising to find that the shapes of bivalves are highly varied — some are globular, others flat and plate-like, some like razor shell () have become greatly elongated to avoid burrowing, and some in forms of the usual ‘mirror image’ symmetry has been lost.",4
420,"The thicker shelled  species often carry a distinctive sculpture, which is also important in identifying fossil species.",4

425,The outer perimeter carries a raised ridge.,4
426,"Gastropods of this kind are typical of Ordovician and Silurian strata, where there are a number of genera and many species of comparable form.",4
427,"This species is from the Wenlock Limestone of Dudley, England.",4
428,Similar species can be found in Silurian limestones all over Europe and North America.,4
429,The specimen has a diameter of 6 cm.,4
430,Gastropods of this antiquity preserved in limestone can be difficult to clean.,4
431,"In this case the shell material is more resistant than the enclosing limestone, and the specimen has been weathered the rock in good condition.",4
432,Most bivalve fossils are a few centimetres long; the ideal size for collecting.,4
433,But a few giants are known.,4
434,"The Cretaceous genus sometimes grew well over a metre in length; fragments of this particular genus are frequently important components of the soft, white Cretaceous limestone known as chalk.",4
435,"The giant clam () of modern reefs is a familiar living goliath, but reports of it greedily trapping divers are legends of dubious veracity.",4
436,"The bivalves have long geological history, with a few doubtful species known even in Cambrian strata, but like many other molluscan groups they really become established and diverse during the Ordovician.",4
437,By the end of the Ordovician they had already radiated into many of the niches they occupy today.,4
438,"Their story from then on is one of slow, but steady, increase and diversification.",4
439,Bivalves seem generally to have evolved at a slow canter a brisk gallop (ammonites pp. 73–6) and some living bivalves have a very long ancestry; the small sized genus () has relatives in Ordovician rocks not very different from Recent species.,4
440,"But the ancestors of many of the modern bivalves arose during the Mesozoic, and unlike many of the animals in this book the bivalves were affected in a much lees dramatic way by the Mesozoic-Tertiary extinction events that extirpated so many other major elements in the marine fauna.",4
441,"their general conservatism the bivalves produce some short-lived, bizarre forms with no living survivors.",4
442,"Most extraordinary of these are the Cretaceous rudists (p. 47) a group in which one valve became modified to a long cone, on which the other valve rested like a lid, the whole effect being most un-clammish.",4
443,Some clams have shells composed of the form of calcium carbonate known as aragonite (like scleractinian corals) which is easily dissolved away when they are entombed in sediment: this leaves the clam preserved as an impression on the sediment of its internal and external surfaces (internal and external moulds).,4
444,"It is important to collect both ‘halves’ of the fossil to get an accurate representation of the shell — the external mould will preserve the overall shape and sculptural details, while the internal mould shows what the teeth and muscle scars were like.",4
445,"The reader may be confused to find what we here call bivalves, referred to in other books as pelecypods or lamellibranchs — these are just different names for the same animals.",4
446,The name accepted by most scientists today for the two-shelled class of molluscs is also fortunately the simplest — Bivalvia.,4
447,"THE SNAILS — CLASS GASTROPODA (Colour plates 16, 18)",4
448,‘Slugs and snails and puppy dogs' tails’— there seems to be something in the popular imagination that finds snails slightly repulsive.,4
449,"But this class of molluscs includes not only the greatest number of living molluscan species, including those that have most successfully colonized land, but also some of their shells have a financial value that may even be proportion to their aesthetic qualities.",4
450,"The gastropods are molluscs with a single, usually helically-coiled shell, with the foot modified into an efficient creeping organ with a head usually with eyes and tentacles, and with a rasp like feeding organ () composed of a series of pointed teeth.",4
451,"The gastropods have become adapted to a very wide range of habitats, from high mountain streams to deep oceans, and each habitat type has its own species confined to it.",4
452,"Fresh water gastropods are different from  marine ones, and within the marine habitat itself the gastropods are strongly zoned ecologically, even on the same shore different species will be found in different areas their relation to the tide marks, degree of exposure, their diet, .",4
453,"Usually such fine habitat details are not preserved in the fossil record, and the gastropods we find are a jumble of shells displaced from their original microhabitats.",4
454,Many gastropods are grazers: they use their radula to rasp away at algae.,4
455,"Some feed more or less directly on sediment, from which they extract edible particles.",4
456,"There are a large number of living species that are predators, some species using the modified radula as a kind of poison dart, others employing it to bore neat, perfectly round holes through the shells of prey (often bivalves) to get at the nutritious interior.",4
457,Some of these predators are specialists concentrating on one particular prey   type.,4

495,"While the majority are coiled in an upward spiral, some are modified into simple, cap-like forms (like the limpets), and others are coiled in a flat plane, like a ram's horn.",4
496,"Some genera have high spires, with many turns of the shell visible externally, others have low, broad spires in which the last overlaps the earlier ones.",4
497,"Perhaps more than any other group of molluscs the gastropods are remarkable for  the variety and beauty of the external sculpture on the shell, which may be covered with a delicate tracery of ribs and lines, or stout spines, or fine prickles.",4
498,"Many species have the aperture flared, or extended into a long tube (forms).",4
499,"Sometimes you can find a lid () preserved as a fossil, that closed the aperture when the mollusc withdrew into its shell.",4
500,"All these characters are used in the identification of fossil species, but the colour patterns that may be characteristic of living species are not available in the great majority of fossils.",4
501,"Like some of the bivalves, some gastropods had shells composed of the mineral aragonite, and these are usually preserved as moulds: but a cast taken from the external mould will replicate the fine detail of the external sculpture.",4

503,"As with most fossils of this comparatively recent date, the shell looks now much as it would have done when the animal first died, the loss of pigment.",4
504,"This gastropod is unusual in that its aperture lies on its left-hand side, not on the right as in most other species.",4
505,Its specific name ‘’ indicates this.,4

511,"These exquisitely preserved gastropods are largely free of the enclosing matrix, and look now much as they would have done 60 million years ago.",4
512,"Gastropods of this type are characterized by strong ribs produced into spines, a long aperture, and relatively low spire looking rather like a Mayan pyramid.",4
513,"There are many similar species, widespread in Tertiary times.",4
514,"These specimens are from the Eocene of Grignon, France, but similar species occur on most continents The specimens illustrated range from 2–4 cm long, the stage of growth they have reached.",4
515,"Many species of occur in clays, and the matrix can usually be removed with only gentle washing to give fine, clean specimens.",4
516,"The species shown here is in a crumbly limestone, easily removed with gentle brushing.",4
517,"There are small helically-coiled shells present even in Cambrian rocks, and it seems likely that the gastropods diverged from the other molluscs late in the Precambrian.",4
518,By the Ordovician the gastropods were a varied group present in a variety of shallow water habitats.,4
519,As might be expected most of the Palaeozoic gastropods belong to primitive groups: a few of these primitive snails survive today as inconspicuous members of the Recent fauna.,4
520,"By the Carboniferous many of the shapes we see in living gastropods can be matched in the fossils, but despite these similarities the majority of the Palaeozoic forms were not closely related to their living analogues; this is another example of similar-looking forms evolving independently probably similar life habits.",4
521,It was during the Mesozoic that the forms ancestral to many of the living gastropods evolved.,4
522,"the adoption of predatory habits was a new departure for the gastropods, and was responsible for a proliferation of the group unmatched in their Palaeozoic history.",4
523,"They continued to evolve with undiminished vigour through the Tertiary, and their fossil remains are nowhere more abundant than in the ‘crags’ of later Tertiary age.",4
524,The gastropods are one of many groups that record the faunal changes connected with the advance and retreat of the Ice Sheets during the Pleistocene.,4
525,"The invasion of the non-marine habitat probably first happened in the Carboniferous, but relatives of the living land snails are rare before the Cretaceous, at which time the familiar made its first appearance.",4
526,"The slugs were derived from this group by reduction of the shell, at which stage they become distinctly less qualified to have a fossil record!",4
527,Gastropods can leave other evidence of their activities.,4

530,"The cephalopods include the most complex and ‘advanced’ of the molluscs, and are a group of the greatest geological, biological interest.",4
531,"They have muscular tentacles in a well-developed head region, highly efficient eyes which are similar in construction to those of vertebrates (although obviously independently derived), and they feed with the aid of strong, beak-like jaws.",4
532,"They are predators, and probably always have been, and it may have been the adoption of hunting habits that favoured the development of high intelligence.",4
533,"Certainly, living cephalopods have a sophisticated nervous system and a relatively large ‘brain': octopuses seem to be capable of very rapid learning.",4
534,Perhaps H. G. Wells made the right choice when he cast octopus-like animals in the role of intelligent alien invaders in .,4
535,"The cephalopods evolved from another (gastropod-like?) mollusc at some time during the Cambrian, but their earliest history is little known.",4
536,Like most other molluscan groups they rapidly diversified in the Ordovician.,4
537,"These early nautiloids were probably predators also, and if this were so they may have been the first rapidly moving, efficient hunters in the sea.",4
538,Their impact on the marine communities of the Ordovician must have been profound.,4
539,The presence of efficient predators would have acted as a stimulus in the evolution of other groups: even algal grazers would be compelled to evolve protective devices or rapid reproductive strategies to outpace predatory depredations.,4
540,We have seen how many animal groups diversified during the Ordovician; the rapid evolution of nautiloid cephalopods at the same time may be more than coincidence.,4
541,Rapid movement in cephalopods is achieved by expulsion of water from a muscular funnel beneath the head.,4
542,"Most of the living cephalopods also have an ink sac which injects a smoky fluid into the water when the animal is threatened, under cover of which they can make their own jet-propelled escape.",4
543,"Since living does have an ink sac, this must have been a protective device evolved at a later stage in cephalopod evolution.",4
544,"Many cephalopod species behave gregariously today, travelling in swarms their favourite prey (often small crustacea).",4
545,"Fossil cephalopods belonging to one species are often  found together in large numbers and this may reflect similar gregarious habits, but there are other possible explanations — , concentrations of fossil shells may have been sorted by currents.",4
546,The living pearly ; section showing its internal division into chambers,4
547,NAUTILOIDS,4
548,"The earliest cephalopods found as fossils are nautiloids and they also have the longest history, because the living pearly belongs to the same group.",4
549,"The single Recent genus scarcely reflects the diversity attained by the group in Palaeozoic seas, and a hundred different genera have been described from the Lower Palaeozoic alone.",4
550,"Sections through the living (p.72) are often sold as ornaments, and well illustrate the distinctive features of nautiloid hard parts.",4
551,The body of the animal occupied the cavity at the end of the spiral — the living chamber.,4
552,Behind the living chamber the rest of the shell is divided into smaller chambers.,4
553,As the animal grew it secreted a wall () between the body chamber and the chamber immediately behind — walled off part of its home .,4
554,Running along the middle part of the shell there is a narrow tube — the — which connects the living chamber with the earlier parts of the shell.,4
555,"The empty chambers are usually supposed to have been filled with gas, which help to give the animal , and via the siphuncle the animal can vary its to control its position in the water column.",4
556,"Some of the early nautiloids deposit calcium carbonate in the voided chambers, which may also have been connected with controlling buoyancy.",4
557,Where the septum meets the body wall it does so in a smooth curve.,4
558,Internal moulds of fossil nautiloids often reveal a series of such lines marking the boundaries of the chambers — these are known as .,4
559,All nautiloids have simple suture lines.,4
560,When they first appear in the early Ordovician the majority of nautiloid shells are straight or slightly curved; they are ‘unwound’ forms.,4
561,"Some of these straight orthocone nautiloids achieve considerable dimensions, several metres long, and they must have been formidable predators on the other marine animals of the time.",4
562,"Quite early in their history some partly coiled or even tightly coiled species evolved, and the various coiling types seem to have coexisted successfully side by side.",4
563,"Some of these early nautiloids occurred in such abundance that they are conspicuous enough to form an appreciable part of limestone formations — the ‘Orthoceras Limestone’(Ordovician) is one of these, widely distributed through Scandinavia.",4
564,"The nautiloids achieved their widest range of adaptations and greatest variety of form in the Ordovician and Silurian periods, with various coiled forms, straight, pipe-like forms, and curious dumpy species with restricted apertures that may have adopted a sluggish (possible filter-feeding) mode of life.",4
565,Thin sections show a great variety of internal structures important in accurate identification.,4
566,"In the Devonian period the nautiloids were still abundant and varied, but they suffered a slow eclipse coincident with the rise of the ammonoids.",4
567,"Nonetheless unlike many of their Palaeozoic companions, they survived the late Permian extinction, and the ancestors of the living even underwent a minor evolutionary burst in the Mesozoic, where forms quite similar to the pearly can be common fossils.",4
568,"And in the end the nautiloids even survived the ammonites, the molluscan group that evolved more rapidly and more spectacularly than any other.",4
569,AMMONOIDS (‘AMMONITES’),4
570,"The ammonoids were derived from the nautiloids probably during the early Devonian, and from the Carboniferous until the Cretaceous are among the most abundant of fossil groups, in some rock types dominating to the exclusion of most other members of the fauna.",4
571,Ammonoids differ from nautiloids in the suture lines being wavy or crimped; this reflects an elaboration of the outer part of the walls (septa) separating the chambers in the earlier part of the shell.,4
572,The siphuncle in most ammonoids runs not through the middle of the whorl but along the outer edge.,4
573,"There has been a lot of debate about the reasons for producing complicated patterns on the suture line; what advantage would this have given the ammonoids over their nautiloid ancestors, that allowed for the explosive bursts of ammonoid evolution?",4
574,"It cannot be coincidence that the folding of the septal walls occurs at the point where they meet the body shell of the animal; this is a point of relative weakness, and all good joinery benefits from strengthening the joint.",4
575,"The earlier ammonoids had gently wavy sutures, and many of the Mesozoic ones had sutures almost incredibly folded and contorted, so it looks natural selection were generally favouring increase in the elaboration of the folds.",4
576,"One simple explanation, which is attractive  and plausible, is that the strengthening enabled the ammonoid shell to withstand the hydrostatic pressure at relatively great depths in the ocean — they need not be confined to the surface waters or to relatively shallow depths.",4
577,"Certainly individual ammonoid species became extremely widespread, and oceans were not a barrier to their distribution.",4
578,"They became masters of the pelagic realm, possibly swimming in schools like their distant relatives the squids.",4
579,Like living pelagic animals they had preferences for particular water temperatures; different types of ammonoids were found in high or low latitudes.,4
580,"Since the disposition of continents has changed, these ‘faunal realms’ offer a method of deducing the distribution of past climatic belts.",4
581,"Ceratite ammonoid,, Triassic.",4
582,"This specimen is an internal mould in limestone, and shows the suture lines well — the boundaries between chambers on the inside of the shell.",4
583,"This ammonite has only a few strong ribs, with a number of small tubercles .",4
584,The looping form of the suture lines is also characteristic Ceratites are typical of Triassic rocks and there are numerous related species differing in details of ribbing and suture lines Such ammonites are plentiful in marine limestones of the right age across the continent of Europe (though not in England).,4

588,Numerous small specimens are preserved higgledy-piggledy in an impure limestone.,4
589,"Some retain their shell, others show the dark internal moulds.",4
590,"Small size, unbranched and strong ribs, giving the shell a ramshorn appearance, are important characters This form has a number of related species, but the situation is complicated by the fact that some large ammonites have inner whorls looking rather like This specimen is from the Lias of Somerset, England.",4
591,Individuals do not exceed 2 cm in diameter.,4
592,"Whatever the reasons for their change from their nautiloid ancestors, the ammonoids were an enormously successful group: thousands of different species have been described, and their variety is so bewildering that many specialists devote their lives to studying only the ammonoids of a particular, short time period.",4
593,The changes that they underwent are an infinite set of variations on a relatively limited number of themes.,4
594,"Most important, perhaps, are the characteristics of the suture lines, which are displayed on internal moulds.",4
595,The mature shell size also varies from small species a few centimetres across to giants of a metre or more in diameter.,4
596,Some species grew in such a way that the last whorl overlaps the inner ones; often these species become flat and discus-shaped: it has been suggested that this was a more ‘streamlined’ shape for active swimmers.,4
597,"Other species have squat whorls, the whole ammonoid being so tightly rolled up as to be almost spherical.",4
598,"The exterior surface of most ammonoids is covered with ribbing — dense on some species, sparse on others — the ribs often split into two or more smaller ribs as they pass over the back of the whorls.",4
599,"Many ammonoids additionally carry spines, warts, tubercles or lumpy excrescences, the large shells can look positively burdened with sculpture.",4
600,It is difficult to imagine that such species were rapid swimmers.,4
601,"Others, particularly the discus-shaped forms, were smooth externally.",4
602,All these features are used in the classification of the group.,4
603,A particularly puzzling aspect of the ammonoids is a great resemblance between external shell features that can be produced at different times by otherwise unrelated ammonoids.,4
604,Such are presumably produced very similar life habits.,4
605,"The origins of a particular homoeomorph can usually be deduced by studying the internal features (the suture lines), or by tracing its derivation from geologically older species in underlying beds.",4
606,It is only in relatively recent years that two sexes have been recognized in ammonoid species.,4
607,"They were originally thought to have been two closely related species occurring together in the same rocks, but these ‘pairs’ were so consistently found together that it became more and more probable that they were sexual forms of the same species.",4
608,"The smaller of the two is considered to be the male, which also tends to have rather stronger ribbing, and sometimes a differently shaped aperture from the larger female.",4

619,In the Carboniferous a great variety of forms with highly zig-zag suture lines are a distinctive group of ammonoids usually known as .,4
620,By the Permian-Triassic the suture lines of many ammonites had begun to assume the highly crimped and complex form that was to characterize much of their later history; the ceratites of the Triassic combined broad loops and tight folds in a distinctive pattern (p.74).,4
621,"It was in the Jurassic that the ammonoids achieved their greatest flowering, when the clays and shales of the period may be solid with the remains of their shells.",4
622,"The whole gamut of shell shapes, ornaments, and sutural complexity was present during this time.",4
623,"Their rise was not, however, one of simple and progressive increase in variety.",4
624,"At several times, notably at the end of the Palaeozoic, they suffered massive and largely unexplained extinctions, a few survivors giving rise to the variety of forms that followed.",4
625,"their success they seemed to be vulnerable to extirpation in a way that some of the less imaginative molluscs, like the bivalves seemed to be immune.",4
626,"The group persisted, successfully, into the Cretaceous, at the end of which period the whole group, apparently rather suddenly, became extinct.",4
627,We shall return to this sudden death of an important group in Chapter 6.,4
628,"No description of the ammonoids is complete without mentioning the These are forms which abandoned the usual plane spiral mode of coiling, and instead became partially or even completely uncoiled, or became twisted in some other fashion.",4
629,"Some forms () adopted the helical spire, and were it not for the obligatory suture lines it might be possible to mistake these species for large gastropods.",4
630,"In others the coils became loose, like a watch spring.",4
631,Still others developed a bizarre backward hook in their mature stage.,4
632,"The extreme heteromorphs are perhaps to be found in the genus , which looks like a tangle of whorls where any obvious semblance of symmetrical coiling seems to have been lost (left), and which is virtually straight after its earliest whorls.",4
633,"Most of these heteromorphs were derived from ‘normal’ ammonoids, but there is one  famous example where an uncoiled form actually gave rise to a conventional-looking ammonoid by coiling up again!",4
634,"are particularly common in, but confined to, Cretaceous rocks.",4
635,At one time it was supposed that the ammonoids were suffering from ‘racial senescence’ at that time and that the uncoiling represented a kind of genetic exhaustion.,4
636,"This resulted in their reversion to resemble some of their earliest ancestors (the straight nautiloids) and squared with the observation that some of the heteromorphs even reverted to simple, wavy sutures again.",4
637,"However, the heteromorphs were extremely successful and widespread, and they are accompanied by, and even survived by other species with a perfectly usual appearance.",4
638,The explanation lies in something less mysterious than ‘racial senescence’.,4
639,Far from being an expression of decline the heteromorphs show the ammonoids adopting new (and successful) life habits.,4
640,"Some of them may have become bottom living, crawling hunters for which a gastropod-like shell would have been more appropriate.",4
641,Loss of active swimming habits may have rendered the complex suture lines superfluous.,4
642,"But their displacement from a dominant role in the pelagic habitat may have accompanied the rise of squid, sepioids, and octopods.",4
643,"Ammonoids, heteromorphs included, are almost without parallel as stratigraphic indicators.",4
644,"They evolved rapidly and spread widely, and have a range of distinctive characters to help the investigator in his identifications.",4

649,The cigar-shaped belemnoids ('belemnites') are common fossils accompanying the ammonoids in Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks.,4
650,"The fossil is an internal skeleton (enclosed within the body) of a squid-like animal, in a way comparable with the cuttle bone of the living cuttle-fish.",4
651,"The solid calcite of this internal skeleton makes the belemnoid a resistant fossil, and fragments are common survivors of erosion, often picked up on ‘Recent’ beaches.",4
652,"The chambered shell () is less conspicuous — it is tucked into the broad end of the fossil guard, where the series of closely-spaced septa reveal the cephalopod nature of these otherwise somewhat featureless fossils.",4
653,"Belemnites vary from small fossils a centimetre or two long to large specimens tens of centimetres long: these are only a fraction of the size of the living animal, with their tentacles extending well beyond the guard.",4
654,"The belemnoids disappear from the fossil record at the end of the Cretaceous, but some of the group gave rise to living squid-like animals, and so they are not to be regarded as extinct in the same, final way as the ammonoids.",4
655,OTHER MOLLUSCAN CLASSES,4
656,Some molluscs are found as fossils which belong to groups the familiar ones described previously.,4
657,"Although they are rarer fossils, some of them are of such interest that they are worth mentioning here.",4
658,One of the most exciting are the Monoplacophora.,4
659,"These are a group of extremely primitive molluscs, which are found in any abundance only in Lower Palaeozoic rocks.",4
660,"They are usually simple cap-shaped shells looking somewhat like limpets, but on their internal surfaces they carry a series of paired muscle impressions.",4
661,"Many authorities regard the Monoplacophora as lying at the root of the other molluscan groups; gastropods, cephalopods and even bivalves may have been derived from them.",4
662,For many years they were known only from fossil representatives and were believed to be extinct.,4
663,It was an amazing discovery to find that monoplacophorans were still alive and well — living ones were dredged from the deep ocean in the early 1950's.,4
664,"Not only that, the living form had hardly changed from its Silurian predecessor (p. 77).",4
665,"The monoplacophorans really reached their acme in the Cambrian, with curious forms having shapes that have never been paralleled in other molluscs ().",4
666,Another odd group that did not survive the Palaeozoic were the Rostroconchs.,4
667,These look rather like bivalves without a hinge.,4
668,"They really are extinct, but managed to compete successfully with the bivalves for a considerable time.",4
669,"Finally, the tusk shells (Scaphopoda) are a long-lived group with a record stretching from the Ordovician to the present.",4
670,"They are the only molluscs with a truly tubular shell, usually gently curved, with an opening  at both ends.",4
671,"They live today with the broad end buried in the sediment, where they forage for food using small prehensile filaments.",4
672,"Their habits have probably always been similar, and if survival is to be taken as a measure of success, their conservative way of life has ensured them of a leading place in the evolutionary marathon.",4
673,Other animals described in this book have occupied a specific ecological niche where they can quietly pursue their own speciality without embarking on any spectacular radiation in the manner of the ammonoids.,4
674,It is a curious paradox that often the most spectacularly successful and numerous organisms are also those with a finite geological record.,4
675,Primitive molluscs: Monoplacophora.,4
676,"Silurian fossils very like the ‘living fossil’(), and the peculiar Cambrian form ().",4
677,THE ECHINODERMS — PHYLUM ECHINODERMATA,4
678,"Sea urchins, starfish, sea lilies and sea cucumbers are living echinoderms — the ‘spiny skinned’ animals, the Greek name of the phylum.",4
679,"It is an appropriate name, for most echinoderms do feel prickly to the touch, and the sea urchins are equipped with fearsome spines.",4
680,"The skeleton of all echinoderms except the sea cucumbers is a relatively strong assembly of calcite plates; the animals are built from an interlocking mosaic of such plates, and mostly the skeletons are rigid enough to have a high chance of fossilization.",4
681,The geological record of the phylum is accordingly excellent.,4
682,"The echinoderm skeleton is not a truly external one, like that of the molluscs, for it is surrounded on the by a thin skin of living tissue.",4
683,"The mosaic of calcite plates is a particular feature of the phylum, and serves as one of the characters linking together such dissimilar-looking animals as starfish and sea lilies.",4
684,"Another unique feature is the water vascular system, a system of internal plumbing that drives the : mobile, club-shaped sacs arranged in serried ranks on the the animal, which operate in harmony to convey food to the mouth, or in locomotion.",4
685,They have a well-developed nervous system.,4
686,Most echinoderms also have an unique five-rayed radial symmetry in the overall shape of the skeleton.,4
687,This five-fold (pentameral) symmetry seems a peculiar number to be present over such a wide range of organisms.,4
688,"Why not four, six or thirteen?",4
689,"The answer is still not clear, but what is certain is that the five-rayed plan was established even in the Cambrian in a number of diverse echinoderms; it is evidently highly functional.",4
690,"In detail the echinoderms show evidence of bilateral (mirror image) symmetry, from which five-fold symmetry was probably derived.",4
691,"Once acquired it is rarely lost, even in echinoderms like sea urchins that (perhaps) could also function on a different symmetry pattern.",4
692,"Each plate of an echinoderm is composed of a single crystal of calcite, whereas all of the organisms we have discussed above have skeletons composed of felt-like masses of tiny crystals.",4
693,Broken echinoderm plates ‘catch the light’— the single crystals break along cleavage planes and so present a uniform reflective surface.,4
694,"Many rocks are composed of a high proportion of echinoderm debris, which is easily recognized this optical property.",4
695,"Through their long history the echinoderms have never left the sea, but within their preferred medium they have adopted most of the life habits available to marine organisms.",4
696,"They include grazers, feeding on simple plants, scavengers, mud eaters, filter-feeders extracting microorganisms from currents, and some efficient and versatile hunters.",4
697,"Like other marine organisms they have a planktonic larval stage that assists their dispersal, but almost all adult echinoderms lead a bottom dwelling  existence; a few sea lilies have successfully cast off their anchorage to the sea floor and become widespread swimmers.",4
698,The echinoderms are such a varied and important group that the different kinds have to be considered separately.,4
699,"I should add that some of the most interesting echinoderms are also some of the rarest — peculiar, plated animals that do not fit comfortably into the array of living forms.",4
700,Many of these occur in the Cambrian — it is the echinoderms tried out various designs before settling for the successful models that mostly survive today.,4
701,"The echinoderms are a phylum closely allied to the Chordates — including the vertebrates, and both phyla probably have a common ancestor in the Precambrian.",4
702,"SEA LILIES — CLASS CRINOIDEA, AND OTHER STEMMED ECHINODERMS (Colour plates 22, 23, 24)",4
703,Crinoids are abundant and important fossils from the Ordovician to the Tertiary.,4
704,"They are still abundant , although less common in shallow water sites than they were in the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic, but they are conspicuous and varied components of deep water faunas.",4
705,"The great majority of the group have long stalks, which are anchored to the bottom.",4
706,"The main part of the animal consists of a cup (or ) to which the stalk is attached at its upper end, and from the top of the calyx stretch long arms, which are five in number or more usually a multiple of five.",4
707,The arms are often repeatedly branched.,4
708,"The distal parts of the arms carry fine , which are instrumental in gathering the fine, water-borne food micro-organisms on which the animal feeds.",4
709,"Since crinoids often occur together in large numbers ('gardens') with their arms waving in the currents, it is easy to see how they came to acquire their botanical analogy.",4
710,"Food grooves in the arms channel the food to the mouth, which lies in the centre of the calyx.",4
711,"Stem, calyx, and arms are all made of calcite plates.",4
712,"The stems are often common fossils, the calyx cannot be found — many of the ‘crinoidal limestones’ are composed largely of stem debris.",4
713,The individual plates of the stem slot together like a stack of coins; they are termed .,4
714,"These can be round, or five-sided, a centimetre or so across, and have a small hole in their centre; the stems can look like corals to the casual observer, but where they are broken they show the typical echinoderm reflective surfaces.",4
715,"Detailed classification of the crinoids is based principally on the way the calcite plates are arranged on the calyx with the number and branching patterns of the arms, the external sculpture on the calyx, and important internal features of the cup connected with the nervous and respiratory systems.",4
716,In detail they are a very complicated group.,4
717,"Complete specimens of fossil crinoids are rather rare, and deserve pride of place in anyone's collection.",4
718,"Complete cups are more common — many of them were evidently rigid, and they are easily preserved as fossils.",4
719,"There are famous examples where whole ‘gardens’ seem to have been preserved, with the arms frozen, , in motion, and even the roots at the base of the stems in place.",4
720,"Crinoid,from the Carboniferous (Mississipian ).",4
721,"The species is preserved in relief in limestone, which is very fine grained, and retains many fine details.",4
722,"The long stem of this crinoid, with a small cup at the top, and stout arms composed of easily visible calcite plates, these first arms themselves dividing, are some of the more important characteristics of this species.",4
723,"There are numerous Carboniferous crinoids not unlike this one, which require expert knowledge in their discrimination.",4
724,"This specimen is from Illinois, USA, but forms related to it may be found in Carboniferous limestones in many areas.",4
725,The specimen is 15 cm long.,4
726,The crinoids have had an eventful geological history.,4
727,"True crinoids are doubtfully known before the Ordovician, but once established they diversified rapidly in the manner we have seen repeatedly with other groups.",4
728,"They soon spread to a variety of habitats, but in the Palaeozoic they were conspicuously abundant in relatively shallow environments.",4
729,"The most mouthwatering specimens tend to be found in limestones — famous sites are in the Silurian rocks of England and Mississipian rocks of the U.S.A. The group as a whole had a   major crisis in the Permian, during which most of the Palaeozoic forms died out.",4
730,A very few of these survived into the Triassic.,4
731,"In the Mesozoic there was another great radiation of the crinoids, the typical forms having flexible arms, and it is crinoids of this kind that survive today.",4
732,"Some of the most famous crinoidal deposits are of Jurassic age, and marvellous specimens have been collected from the Lias rocks of Britain and Germany.",4
733,"A new and successful innovation was the evolution of stemless crinoids — some of these acquired pelagic habits, and during the Cretaceous the genera and (p.79) were widespread enough to be useful marker fossils.",4
734,"Some of these stemless forms developed grappling hooks at the base of the calyx — with these they can attach in a favourable site, and move when conditions become adverse.",4
735,Such feather stars are very numerous in some reef habitats today.,4
736,The long and varied history of the crinoids demonstrates how well the echinoderms have attacked the problems of filter-feeding.,4
737,"The stemless crinoid , widespread during the Cretaceous.",4
738,Natural size.,4
739,"Fossil crinoid (sea lily),Carboniferous (Mississipian ).",4
740,"The specimen is unusually complete for a fossil sea lily, and lies on a fine-grained limestone.",4
741,There is a certain amount of crushing of the cup beneath the arms.,4
742,The stem is broken off.,4
743,"Note the fine, thread-like attached to the arms — used by the animal to trap food particles — and the thin and flexible stem.",4
744,"There are quite a large number of species in Carboniferous and Permian rocks which resemble the species illustrated here This species is from the limestones of Keokuk, Iowa, USA.",4
745,The arms of this specimen have a length of about 4 cm.,4
746,"Blastoid,Carboniferous (Mississipian ).",4
747,The specimen is preserved in its original calcite; its lack of distortion may be seen from its perfect five-fold symmetry.,4
748,"The five finely striated food grooves, which in this view occupy much of the surface of the animal, are typical of the blastoid.",4
749,The name ‘blastoid’ is derived from the Greek for ‘bud’the resemblance of the animal to a flower bud.,4
750,"is a large genus with many species in limestone of Carboniferous age, particularly in the Mississipian limestones of North America.",4
751,"This specimen is from Grayson co., Kentucky, USA.",4
752,"Similar species occur in North and South America, and related genera almost worldwide The specimen has a diameter of 3 cm.",4
753,"In the Palaeozoic rocks there were other stalked filter-feeding echinoderms, which failed to survive the crisis at the end of the Permian, weathered by the crinoids.",4
754,"These extinct groups can exceed crinoids in number and variety at certain horizons, and they were evidently competing on equal terms.",4
755,"The (class Blastoidea) had compact cups a few centimetres long, with five broad food grooves running down the (lacking crinoid arms).",4
756,In life the food grooves were flanked by lines of delicate armlets () which served to gather the food.,4
757,"Blastoids are sometimes abundant fossils in rocks (usually limestone) of Silurian to early Permian age, and their perfect, compact pentameral symmetry makes their calices among the most attractive of fossils.",4
758,"Like crinoids they evidently grew in gardens, for their remains (especially in Carboniferous rocks) tend to occur packed together in thousands.",4
759,"(class Cystoidea) are even odder animals: often rather irregular bags of calcite plates, or if composed of a few plates these may carry powerful ribbing.",4
760,"The five-fold symmetry is often hard to detect in the calyx as a whole, although five food grooves are usually developed.",4
761,"They are a primitive, but very interesting, group with Cambrian origins, and reached their greatest variety in the Ordovician.",4
762,"Some of them evidently lacked a stem, and must have lain loosely on the bottom.",4
763,"There are several more groups of odd echinoderms in the Lower Palaeozoic rocks — some of them only recently discovered, like the bizarre helicoplacoids, which look like nothing spinning tops (p. 84).",4
764,"All are of the greatest interest, and plated animal from the Cambrian is likely to be an important specimen.",4
765,Sometimes these early forms are found as moulds — the original calcite having dissolved away.,4
766,"The external moulds then present a characteristic appearance, like the impression of a mosaic pressed into the rock.",4
767,It is well worth keeping a   special watch for fossils of this kind when hunting in Cambrian localities — it is still perfectly possible to discover a completely new kind of echinoderm!,4
768,"18 Eocene gastropod,.",4

852,The largest specimen here does not greatly exceed 2 cm in length.,4
853,SEA URCHINS — CLASS ECHINOIDEA (Colour plates 25–29),4
854,Anyone who has waded into the clear blue waters of the Mediterranean without proper footwear may have encountered the protective covering of the sea urchins.,4
855,"Many of the living echinoids are protected by spines, some sharp and breaking off easily into the unwary foot, others stout and clublike; a few groups have taken to burrowing into sediment, and the spines have become small and felt-like.",4
856,Under the spines there is a test composed of hundreds of calcite plates.,4
857,there is no stem — the sea urchins are self-propelled.,4
858,Looking more closely at the arrangement of the calcite plates the fivefold symmetry is still in evidence — in this group there are five areas of finer plates () radiating from the centre.,4
859,"Under a lens these small plates show perforations, and during life the tiny tube feet passed through these to assist the animal in locomotion.",4
860,The perfect polygonal joinery of all the plates is a striking feature of the echinoid test.,4
861,"Some sea urchins are almost spherical, with large strong plates looking rather like shields with a boss in the centre.",4
862,These kinds of sea urchins carry the stoutest of spines attached to the bosses.,4
863,Many living sea urchins have undergone a modification of the pentameral symmetry typical of the rest of the echinoderms — they have become bilateral again.,4
864,Perhaps this is not surprising in animals that are accustomed to moving in a particular direction — they need a front and a back.,4
865,"In burrowing forms the mouth moves to one (forward) side and the anus to the back, which is obviously a sensible arrangement.",4
866,"Some species have become greatly flattened like the living sand dollar, which has a covering of very fine spines and can bury itself in sand with remarkable speed.",4
867,The sea urchins are among the most efficient scavengers in the sea-hence their somewhat unsavoury association with human effluvia.,4
868,"They also include species that eat their way through enormous quantities of sediment, extracting edible particles from it, and in the process reprocessing all the sediment; some of the fossil heart urchins probably had this habit (p. 128).",4
869,These vacuum cleaners of the sea are vital in preventing fouling of the marine environment.,4
870,Species with club-shaped spines include active hunters (although they tend to hunt sluggish animals like other sea urchins) and they have powerful jaws on the lower side of the animal that can munch their way through a sand dollar it were a biscuit.,4
871,Some urchins use their jaws to make burrows in solid rock.,4
872,Like other major echinoderm groups the geological record of the sea urchins goes back to the Ordovician.,4
873,"In my experience they are generally rare fossils in the Palaeozoic, but as so often with echinoderms there are localities where large numbers of specimens can be recovered from a bedding plane or two.",4
874,They must have been gregarious from the start.,4
875,The early sea urchins tend to have rather a large number of plates in a much less regular mosaic than their later relatives.,4
876,"By the end of the Palaeozoic, echinoids with club-shaped spines and beautifully regular tests had become well-established, and their distant descendants survive today.",4
877,"It was in the Mesozoic that a really considerable proliferation of urchins occurred, and they acquired the importance in the marine economy that they retain.",4
878,"They are abundant in Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks, represented both by the spherical spiny forms, and some of those with bilateral symmetry.",4
879,"Isolated spines are common fossils, and useful ones too, because their patterns vary from species to species.",4
880,Some of the burrowing forms have left their burrows behind .,4
881,"In England sea urchins are especially easy to collect from the Cretaceous chalk, where they have been used as one of the fossils for dating the rocks.",4
882,"STARFISH — CLASS STELLEROIDEA (Colour plates 30, 32)",4
883,The starfish are among the most important of invertebrate predators living today.,4
884,"They make major depredations on oyster beds and the recent activities of the ‘Crown of Thorns’ starfish () in chewing up great chunks of the Great Barrier Reef have become a modern ecological object lesson (and, incidentally, a source of funds for many marine biologists).",4
885,"There are two major kinds of starfish (which may not be closely related)— the familiar large, stiff-armed , and the delicate , brittle stars, with lithe, slender, snake-like arms radiating from a circular central disc.",4
886,"Ophiuroids are especially abundant in deep sea environments, and it is unusual for a deep sea dredge to miss one of these small animals.",4
887,"Asteroids often have five arms, but many species have more — about forty.",4
888,"Although they are common today starfish are not generally common fossils, but as so often with echinoderms, they seem to be local in occurrence.",4
889,"Their remains are commoner from the Mesozoic onwards, and at some levels, as in the Cretaceous chalk, they can be found in considerable numbers.",4
890,"Their history goes back to the Ordovician, although some of the Palaeozoic asteroids are distantly related, if , to the living species.",4
891,Ophiuroids have fossil representatives as old as Carboniferous.,4
892,"Cassiduloid sea urchin,, Jurassic.",4
893,"The species is preserved without flattening in a hard limestone, which fills the interior of the specimen.",4
894,"This species looks rather like a bun, but not highly convex, and with a five-sided outline.",4
895,The five ambulacral areas — like the petals of a flower — are clearly visible.,4
896,They are not sunken into hollows as on many echinoids This genus and its allies are quite commonly found in Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks.,4
897,"This species is from the Corallian rocks of England, but its relatives occur in Europe, North America and Africa.",4
898,This specimen has a diameter of 8 cm.,4
899,Related species often grow to twice the diameter.,4
900,Jurassic echinoids in this sort of preservation in hard limestones are often difficult to clean.,4
901,Sometimes the natural processes of erosion will etch a perfect specimen.,4
902,THE CARPOIDS — ECHINODERMS OR CHORDATES?,4
903,(Colour plate 31),4
904,One of the oddest groups of animals covered with calcite plates are known as carpoids (occasionally referred to as calcichordates).,4
905,Although they have been known for many years their evolutionary position is still hotly debated.,4
906,"They lack any pretence of five-fold symmetry, some are bilaterally symmetrical, but others have no obvious plane of symmetry , a most unusual thing for any animal.",4
907,They appear to have a stem: could they be related to the crinoids?,4
908,"But the ‘stem’ tapers out to a point, and in some cases had a whip-like flexibility; the same structure has been interpreted as a ‘tail’.",4
909,Similar kinds of arguments can be applied to different parts of these extraordinary fossils.,4
910,"Internally they are really quite complicated, and some possess lobes and channels incised within the plates strikingly similar to the appearance of the brain and nerves in some fishes.",4
911,Some authorities  have suggested that the carpoids may include ancestors of particular chordates.,4
912,"They have a record going well back into the Cambrian, when it might be supposed that the chordates were undergoing a major diversification.",4
913,"Regardless of whether they include ancestors or not, the carpoids do serve to demonstrate the likelihood of evolutionary links between chordates — including vertebrates — and the echinoderms.",4
914,"Carpoids are rare fossils ranging from the Cambrian to the Devonian, when they disappeared completely — unless their descendants live on in one of the chordate groups.",4
915,"Starfish,, Cretaceous.",4
916,"The starfish is preserved in soft white chalk, which fills in the interior of the animal.",4
917,The individual calcite plates can be clearly seen.,4
918,"This starfish has a broad central disc, and slender arms.",4
919,"They are stout plates around the perimeter, but tiny-plates in the central part of the animal.",4
920,"Starfish are uncommon fossils, particularly in this state of completeness, since they easily break into their component plates.",4
921,A few species generally resembling this one occur in Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks.,4
922,"This specimen is from Kent, England, but similar forms occur in the chalk over Europe and in Cretaceous rocks in North America.",4
923,Related forms survive today.,4
924,The specimen measures 10 cm across its longest diameter.,4
925,THE ARTHROPODS — PHYLUM ARTHROPODA,4
926,There are more living arthropod species than all other phyla combined; if diversity is a measure of success then the arthropods are the easy winners.,4
927,"Arthropods are those animals with an external, usually ‘chitinous’ skeleton () and have characteristic legs, feelers, etc., with joints to give them flexibility (arthropod is derived from the  Greek for ‘jointed leg’).",4
928,"They have bodies divided into segments, and their legs and jaws are arranged in pairs.",4
929,"They are mostly small and there is a good physiological reason for this: gigantism is mechanically difficult for animals with external skeletons, and above a certain size it is difficult to get enough oxygen into the organism to sustain activity.",4
930,"Despite this one limitation the arthropods have the most varied habits and habitats of any phylum: they can be found anywhere on land, sea or in the air.",4
931,They inhabit the driest parts of the desert and the deepest parts of the ocean with equal facility.,4
932,"This is partly the flexibility of the external skeleton — it can be modified into wings, fortified into claws, sealed against searing heat, or turned into eye lenses.",4
933,"Segmentation, too, has proved very versatile; individual pairs of legs, or appendages, can be specialized for particular functions without affecting the routine business of locomotion taken by the others; appendages are modified for feeding in a host of ways, for grasping, swimming, spinning, copulating, cleaning or camouflaging.",4
934,"And their small size enables tiny arthropods, some almost too  small to see with the naked eye, to live in crannies, within the soil, between sand grains, and the like.",4
935,They are truly ubiquitous.,4
936,Helicoplacoid — a peculiar and puzzling Cambrian echinoderm,4
937,"Tube of polychaete worm, Rotularia bognoriensis, Eocene.",4
938,"Serpulid tubes are preserved here in a siltstone, with parts of the original shell material adhering.",4
939,The same piece of rock also includes internal moulds of gastropods and bivalves.,4
940,"Worm tubes like these may, at first sight, be confused with gastropod molluscs.",4
941,"The irregularity of the tubes, which become straight near their apertures, distinguishes them from snail shells.",4
942,Serpulid worm tubes are found in many different sediment types in rocks of Mesozoic and Tertiary age.,4
943,"Some species are very tiny, and encrust other shells.",4
944,"This species is from Bognor, England, but related forms occur the world over.",4
945,Overall length of specimens about 3 cm.,4
946,"Cambrian trilobite,, preserved on a fine sandstone, with a certain amount of crushing.",4
947,This is one of the most primitive trilobites known.,4
948,The crescent-shaped eyes are attached to the middle part of the head.,4
949,There are a number of similar species from early Cambrian rocks distinguished on the size of the eyes and details of the thorax.,4
950,The specimen has a length of 10 cm.,4
951,"They are also an ancient group, since obvious arthropods, of primitive kinds, can be found in the earliest of Cambrian rocks.",4
952,"At this time, , they were wholly marine.",4
953,"They were probably derived from some sort of segmented worm (annelid)— a few scientists adopt the view that different arthropods may have come from different and separate worms, independently, which became ‘arthropodized’ by acquiring an external skeleton.",4
954,"With certain exceptions, the fossil record of the arthropods is not commensurate with their diversity today, and their probable diversity in the past.",4
955,Some forms have delicate exterior skeletons that are only preserved under exceptional circumstances (p. 16).,4
956,Many terrestrial forms simply did not live in environments in which preservation was possible.,4
957,"So the record of the group as a whole is patchy, with ‘jumps’ in time between one fossil find and the next.",4
958,"Some groups, those with good, solid (and especially calcified) hard parts are frequent and important fossils, with an unparalleled record.",4
959,A brief summary of the arthropods cannot do justice to all the fascinating specialized groups — sea spiders and mites — that have an incomplete fossil record.,4
960,We shall concentrate on the arthropods with the best fossil record.,4
961,"Some of these are common enough to dominate fossil assemblages, and they are among the most attractive of the common invertebrate groups.",4
962,"TRILOBITES — CLASS TRILOBITA (Colour plates 33, 34, 36, 43)",4
963,"The North American Indians had a name for trilobites that meant ‘little water bug in the rocks’, which shows extraordinary zoological acuity.",4
964,"The trilobites were one of the dominant forms of marine life in the Lower Palaeozoic, known from thousands of different species and found in every continent.",4
965,Not surprisingly they were among the first fossils to attract widespread attention.,4
966,They have a high degree of organization and a variety of form that shows how quickly the arthropods were able to exploit the advantages of their external skeleton.,4
967,All trilobites  are divided lengthways into three lobes — hence their name.,4
968,"They can also be divided crossways into three regions, a well-defined head () at the front, usually equipped with a pair of eyes, a thorax with a variable number of articulated segments, and at the back end a tail (or ) formed by the fusion of several segments.",4
969,"The parts of the animal we find fossilized are usually only the carapace, the hard parts that formed a protective covering on the back of the animal.",4
970,"If we could have turned over a living trilobite we would have seen an array of jointed legs on the underside, and flexible antennae.",4
971,"The traces of these appendages are preserved in exceptional circumstances, so we do know that trilobites had walking legs gills, antennae, and the bases of the legs modified into primitive jaws in some species.",4
972,The appendage pairs are generally similar along the length of animal.,4
973,Few examples of complete trilobites are known and we have to be content with the exterior skeleton.,4
974,Photograph of ‘happy buttons’ taken through the lenses of the eye of the trilobite (see p. 87) of Devonian age.,4
975,"Cambrian trilobite,.",4
976,"This trilobite has been preserved in a curious way: the original shell has been thickened by mineral growth, still of calcite, to give the fossil a distinctive, medallion-like appearance This trilobite has a large number of wide thoracic segments, not greatly convex.",4
977,"The tail is wide, well-segmented.",4
978,"The inflated middle part of the head tapers forwards This species occurs in great numbers in the Wheeler Shale of Utah, USA.",4
979,Related species occur over a much wider area around the margin of North America and in Europe.,4
980,Complete specimens are usually ½-3 cm long.,4
981,"They are sold in rock shops and souvenir centres, often mounted into jewellery.",4
982,Moulting in trilobites; breakup of the exoskeleton into several pieces helped the animal shed its old carapace,4
983,The great variety of form of the hard parts surely shows that trilobites were adapted to a wide range of habitats and life styles.,4
984,"We know that they could live in extremely shallow to very deep-water environments, that most lived on or near the sea bottom, but a few were adapted to open-ocean swimming.",4
985,"They probably had a variety of different habits, some were scavengers, others sediment grazers, and it seems probable that some trilobites were also active hunters, pursuing worms and other soft-bodied prey, which they shredded using the spines on the base of their legs.",4
986,The eyes of trilobites include some very sophisticated structures that show they were far from primitive visually.,4
987,Many species have thousands of lenses — like a fly's eye — which were very sensitive to detecting any movements in their field of view.,4
988,Others had fewer lenses of remarkably efficient construction; photographs have actually been taken (p. 86) using these ancient lenses in a camera — and they still focus precisely after 400 million years or so.,4
989,"The lenses, like the rest of the exoskeleton, are made of calcite.",4
990,"Trinucleid trilobite,, Ordovician.",4
991,"An extraordinary little trilobite looking like an ancient medallion, preserved in shale, with some of its original exoskeleton retained, coloured by iron compounds.",4
992,"Trinucleid trilobites are blind, and with a greatly inflated mid-part of the head region.",4
993,"Around the perimeter of the head there is a pitted fringe, which is unique to this kind of arthropod.",4
994,"Trinucleid trilobites, with various types of fringe, are characteristic of Ordovician rocks.",4
995,There are 100 species.,4
996,"This species is from Builth, Wales.",4
997,"While perhaps commonest in Europe (Wales, Scotland, Sweden, Norway, Czechoslovakia), trinucleids are also known from North America (Virginia, Nevada and various localities in Canada), North Africa and South America.",4
998,Specimens do not usually exceed 2½ cm in length.,4
999,Trilobites vary in length from a millimetre or two to fifty centimetres or more — the ‘average’ trilobite is 5 cm or so long.,4
1000,It is actually rather unusual to find a complete trilobite as a fossil — usually they are in pieces.,4
1001,"Trilobites, like most arthropods, grew by moulting (casting off the old carapace and growing a new, larger one) and many of the bits we find are probably the ‘cast offs’ and not the dead animal.",4
1002,"During moulting the head split into several pieces along special , the thorax often parted into its individual segments and the tail was displaced (p. 86).",4
1003,"The early moults, ‘baby trilobites’, have been discovered.",4
1004,"Some trilobites lost their eyes, probably those that burrowed in mud or lived in lightless parts of the ocean.",4
1005,"Many trilobites could enroll when threatened, just like the living woodlouse some of them even evolved locking devices to make their enrollment really secure.",4
1006,"In some places you can find dozens of enrolled trilobites together; these are the remains of the animals themselves, not the moults, which presumably perished together after a fruitless attempt to protect themselves from a miniature catastrophe a sudden influx of sediment.",4
1007,"Typical trilobites of several kinds are present in the earliest Cambrian rocks; they must have had late Precambrian ancestors, but of these nothing is known.",4
1008,"They swarmed in the Cambrian seas, outnumbering all other invertebrates in most localities.",4
1009,"The trilobites evolved rapidly, and can therefore be used extensively in the dating of rocks at this time.",4
1010,"They continued to proliferate in the Ordovician, although many of the Cambrian kinds had died out; the variety of forms present this period was perhaps their heyday.",4
1011,"Several kinds of trilobite failed to survive the end of the Ordovician, but other trilobites were still conspicuous during the Silurian and Devonian.",4
1012,"Only a few major groups survived into the Carboniferous, but they can still be locally  abundant.",4
1013,"The last trilobites are found in Permian rocks, and before the Triassic they had disappeared forever.",4
1014,"We might perhaps hope that one species lingered on, like the brachiopod , in some inaccessible part of the sea, but as even the deep sea faunas become well-known this possibility is fading.",4
1015,Since many of the extremely ancient rocks in which trilobites can be found are folded or otherwise distorted their remains can often be found twisted or fractured.,4
1016,"But in other sites, particularly in limestones, they can be found with every fine skeletal detail preserved.",4
1017,"The many different kinds are distinguished by the nature of the segmentation, particularly in the head region, the structure of the thorax and pygidium, the size, position and structure of the eyes, the development of the moulting sutures, and the surface patterns on the exterior of the exoskeleton.",4
1018,"New trilobites are being discovered every year, and there is always the possibility of finding one with its legs preserved!",4
1019,"Asaphid trilobite,, Ordovician.",4
1020,"This fine, large trilobite is preserved in relief in a limestone — a common mode of preservation for North American Ordovician trilobites.",4
1021,"A ‘smoothed out’ trilobite, with the head of similar size and shape to the tail, and only eight thoracic segments (contrast the Cambrian trilobites in this book).",4

1024,Many grew to an impressive size.,4
1025,"is typical of the North American continent, where it occurs in many localities.",4

1028,"CRABS, LOBSTERS, SHRIMPS AND THEIR ALLIES — CLASS CRUSTACEA (Colour plates 39, 41)",4
1029,The seas today swarm with crustacean arthropods ranging in size from the tiniest krill in the surface waters to giant bottom-living crabs with a reach like that of a man.,4
1030,"The majority of crustacea have appendages that are specialized to do different jobs along the length of the animal — some for grasping, some for swimming .",4
1031,"Most smaller crustacea have exoskeletons that are rather delicate, and for this reason the fossil record of the shrimps, , is somewhat incomplete.",4
1032,"Undoubted crustaceans are found in rocks as old as Cambrian, at which time free-swimming species were living happily alongside the trilobites.",4
1033,It is not until the Carboniferous that we start to find evidence of a variety of forms including the putative ancestors of some of the living dominant groups.,4
1034,Crabs and lobsters have the thickest exoskeleton of all the group — one like that of the trilobites reinforced with calcium carbonate — and the fossil record of this important group (only a small part of the whole class however) is much better.,4
1035,"Lobster-like animals are found as far back as the Triassic, and both crabs and lobsters are frequent and appealing fossils in Cretaceous and Tertiary rocks.",4
1036,"The group was hardly set back by the major extinction at the end of the Cretaceous, and has never been more varied than it is today.",4
1037,The most highly  specialized crustacea are probably the barnacles (Cirripedia) and individual barnacle plates are rather commonly encountered in rocks of Cretaceous age and younger.,4
1038,"Finally the diminutive, bivalved ostracods are important and abundant fossils, which we will consider with other microfossils in Chapter 8.",4
1039,"SPIDERS, SCORPIONS, SEA SCORPIONS, HORSESHOE CRABS — CLASS CHELICERATA (Colour plates 37, 38, 40)",4
1040,"This large and varied group of arthropods includes the giants of the phylum, tiny spiders hardly visible to the unaided eye.",4
1041,"They are classified together basic similarities in the appendages, they have diversified into very different-looking creatures living equally happily on land and in the sea.",4
1042,"Predatory habits are typical, and many species have specialized clutching appendages, or stinging organs.",4
1043,"None of the group is especially common as fossils, but they make up for their general rarity by their interest.",4
1044,"Most spectacular are the sea scorpions (eurypterids), which include arthropods as large as any that have lived (two.metres or more in length).",4
1045,"Appendages in the ‘head’ region often include powerful claws, and it does not take much imagination to conclude that these eurypterids were among the fiercest predators of their day.",4
1046,"They were prominent in the Silurian and Devonian, where they can be found with the fish-like animals that abounded in the fresh- and brackish water deposits of the time, although some of the Ordovician ones are in marine sediments.",4
1047,Some of the eurypterids may even have made tentative excursions the land.,4
1048,They are also probably the earliest animals in which two sexes can be certainly identified.,4
1049,"The eurypterids are probably allied to the scorpions, which originated in the Silurian or even earlier, and successfully made the transition from the aqueous environment to land.",4
1050,They are abundant enough today in warmer climates to be a serious cause of death in some countries.,4
1051,"Perhaps it was the transition to land that enabled the scorpions to survive beyond the Palaeozoic, which saw the end of the sea scorpions.",4
1052,"Spiders are known as far back as the Carboniferous, but their remains are principally known fossilized from the Tertiary ambers, where perfectly preserved specimens retain even the hairs on the legs.",4
1053,"The Horseshoe Crab () is one of the most celebrated of ‘living fossils’, and it is a genuine survivor having changed little in 150 million years (p. 91).",4
1054,It is the last of the the group of fossil horseshoe crabs that were varied and numerous in the coal swamps of the Carboniferous and have a history that extends back to the Cambrian.,4
1055,Why alone should have survived is something of a mystery.,4
1056,"It appears to have rather generalized habits, feeding on everything from worms to clams, which it can crush with its powerful appendages, using the bases of its legs like nutcrackers.",4
1057,"It can swim, flipped over its boat-like carapace, or crawl.",4

1063,"The legs are shorter than those of the other spider in this book, and the four pairs are clearly visible.",4
1064,This fossil specimen is probably unique.,4
1065,There are species living today related to this fossil species.,4
1066,This specimen was obtained from the Baltic bays.,4
1067,The spider is just over ½cm long,4

1069,"This crab is preserved in a rather soft clay, which makes it more fragile than the other crabs in this book.",4
1070,"The crab has a longer body than the other species shown here, and the legs are flattened and held the carapace.",4
1071,There are a number of species generally similar to this one in rocks of Cretaceous and younger age.,4

1073,"Length of the carapace is 2½ cm, but the species grows to twice this size.",4
1074,"INSECTS — CLASS INSECTA (Colour plates 35, 44, 45)",4
1075,"The insects — flies, butterflies, beetles, ants, fleas, bugs, dragonflies, grasshoppers, aphids, wasps, etc. — are the most varied and numerous of the arthropods both in numbers of species and individuals.",4
1076,"They are also the most perfectly adapted of terrestrial organisms, inhibited neither by extremes of climate nor altitude.",4
1077,If this book were written the number of species in the group the rest of it would have to be devoted to the insects.,4
1078,But the fossil record of the insects is perfect — very sporadic and selective.,4
1079,"Where insects preserved they seem to occur in large numbers and in variety, a few famous localities have yielded a disproportionate number of the fossil species.",4
1080,"Insects are fragile and easily damaged, and it is not surprising that they are sometimes destroyed completely.",4
1081,"Many species live, and presumably lived in the past, in inland or upland sites where little sediment accumulates.",4
1082,"Naturally the commonest insect fossils are the most durable parts, like the wing cases () of the beetles.",4
1083,But their small size also means that insect fossils are easily overlooked and they may be more common than is supposed.,4

1090,This specimen was obtained from a tunnel under London!,4
1091,"Similar specimens are to be obtained from elsewhere in southern England, in France, and in the USA.",4
1092,Diameter of the carapace 6 cm.,4
1093,"Most insects have six legs in three pairs, and are equipped with wings (a number of primitive forms are wingless).",4
1094,"The early evolutionary stages of development of wings are still in question they may have developed from outgrowths of exoskeleton from the body that assisted gliding initially, and then acquired a propulsive function.",4
1095,"In any case winged insects were well established by the Carboniferous, when some of the giant ‘dragonflies’(not really a close relative of the living species) had a wingspan of tens of centimetres.",4
1096,"many of the crucial steps in insect evolution took place during the Devonian, but of this phase of insect history there is very little record.",4
1097,"In the Carboniferous and Permian the insects were highly diverse, and there is still debate over how closely these forms are related to our living fauna: some forms, like the cockroaches, undoubtedly have a long history.",4
1098,"Flight gave the insects the chance to exploit habitats previously vacant, and unrivalled dispersal.",4
1099,"The extraordinary flexibility of the group has meant singular problems in their classification, but certain characteristics, like the structure of the mouthparts or the wing vein patterns serve to define major subdivisions.",4
1100,During the Mesozoic some of the most important types of insects still living  — like the butterflies originated.,4
1101,"Butterflies have an intimate relationship with flowering plants, which they pollinate, and themselves derive nourishment from the nectar.",4
1102,"It is difficult to imagine a butterfly without a plant to feed on, and we have to assume that both the plants and the appropriate pollinators diversified together.",4
1103,"Other kinds of insects besides butterflies have used the nectar of plants for a livelihood, including bees and some flies.",4
1104,"The living horseshoe crab,; compare with Fig. 38.",4
1105,"The fossil record of insects is at its best from Tertiary deposits, where amber, the fossil resin of coniferous trees in which insects became entrapped, yield great numbers of exquisitely preserved specimens.",4
1106,Even the most delicate are present.,4
1107,The oldest amber is Cretaceous.,4
1108,"The fossil remains of beetles, including the hard elytra, have been extensively used in the interpretation of the climatic history of the Pleistocene ice advances and retreats, because the species of beetle present in peat deposits change in harmony with the climatic fluctuations.",4
1109,PHYLUM CHORDATA,4
1110,"The chordates include the dominant living animals, if you measure dominance by size, or the capacity to alter the world.",4
1111,Man is a chordate.,4
1112,The phylum at the present is dominated by its more advanced members — the vertebrates.,4
1113,But in the Cambrian or earlier the chordates included animals little more highly organized than the contemporary arthropods or brachiopods.,4
1114,A few of these survive.,4
1115,"The lancelet,, one of the standard laboratory animals for dissection, is a primitive chordate (there is a single fossil lancelet from the Middle Cambrian).",4
1116,"Hardly anything is known about the fossils from the earliest history of the phylum, possibly because the early chordates lacked hard parts, unless the enigmatic carpoids belong here.",4
1117,"The acquisition of a of calcium phosphate marked the point at which the fossil record began to contribute to the history of the group which, from our selfish viewpoint, we are conditioned to think of lying at the pinnacle of all evolutionary trees.",4
1118,Curiously enough the use of phosphatic material to build hard parts is generally primitive — calcium phosphate shells are nowhere more numerous than in the earliest Cambrian.,4
1119,"All chordates have a nerve chord running along the back, and all higher chordates were derived from forms with gill slits.",4
1120,We are mostly concerned with the history of the vertebrates.,4
1121,"Once the vertebrates were established they quickly acquired hard parts displaying great complexity when compared with most invertebrate phyla (we should except the arthropods, perhaps).",4
1122,"So it is possible to deduce more about the course of evolution from the study of vertebrate  skeletal remains than is possible with most invertebrate groups, but even now, many mysteries remain.",4
1123,"As a generality, the fossil record of the vertebrates is not as complete as that of many of the invertebrate groups, and particularly those with a continuous fossil record like the ammonoids.",4
1124,"Vertebrate remains are decidedly patchy, particularly the terrestrial species.",4
1125,"This is not altogether surprising considering the factors militating against their preservation — break-up of skeletons after death, the necessity to have a skeleton incorporated with sediment, and the activities of predatory and scavenging animals to destroy remains.",4
1126,"So land vertebrates tend to come from relatively few sites, which become exhaustively collected compared with most invertebrate localities.",4
1127,"Some of the sites are enormously rich, however, and the history of palaeontology is punctuated by quite unscientific feuds between experts trying to find and hold on to the best sites for the most spectacular vertebrates.",4
1128,The more impressive the animal the greater the feud; the fights between Professors Cope and Marsh in the last century over the dinosaur remains of North America include examples of double dealing that would not shame an oil tycoon.,4
1129,"Even fish remains are rather local, and do not adequately reflect the abundance of a group that has occupied the seas for 400 million years.",4
1130,There is room here to give only the briefest account of the different kinds of vertebrates.,4
1131,"The higher vertebrates, fossil mammals and dinosaurs , have been described in so many books that they sometimes seem to have as much flesh and blood as any animal in the zoo.",4
1132,The dinosaurs alone have commanded as much popular attention as the rest of the fossil animal kingdom combined.,4
1133,This reflects their spectacular size and the drama of reconstructions of battles to the death between and its armoured contemporaries.,4
1134,The sad truth is that the average collector is unlikely to recover more than the most fragmentary remains of dinosaurs.,4
1135,The commonest vertebrate remains are of teeth or other resistant pieces.,4
1136,Fortunately the teeth of higher vertebrates can tell us .,4
1137,JAWLESS FISH (Colour plate 47),4
1138,"The oldest fossil fish, which are the earliest known vertebrates, lack jaws — the mouth is a simple opening — and are covered on the with bony skeleton.",4
1139,"The first ones seem to have lived in the sea, but by the Silurian the jawless (Agnathan) fish were a prominent component of fresh- and brackish-water sites in many areas of the world, and continued to diversify into the Devonian period.",4
1140,Some of these freshwater fish are heavily armoured and make robust fossils — particularly the headshields.,4
1141,"The insides of the shield have been known to preserve quite tiny details of the nervous system, .",4
1142,"It is probable that the jawless fish lived by grubbing in the sediment, or perhaps by filter feeding, possibly exploiting organic material derived from the plants that were taking to life on land at the same time.",4
1143,"A few living jawless fish are the only remnant of this ancient group, and they are highly specialized forms.",4
1144,The hagfish feeds on dying fish using its rasp-like tongue a solitary tooth on the roof of its mouth.,4
1145,"The lampreys (Petromyzon) are rather nasty external parasites of other fish, to which they attach themselves with a sucker, and proceed to rasp away at the living flesh.",4
1146,"The specialized habits of both these ‘pseudo-fishes’ may have contributed to their survival, when none of their bony-plated relatives survived the Palaeozoic.",4
1147,"Modern specialists often divide the jawless fishes into two broad groups, one containing the hagfish and the other the lamprey, with the fossil jawless forms distributed between the two.",4
1148,"Jawless fish are particularly common in red rocks of the Silurian and Devonian periods, which was a time when non-marine rocks were widespread, and have survived subsequent erosion.",4
1149,"They accompany the eurypterid arthropods (which may have preyed upon them), and we can visualize the rivers and lakes of the time thronging with the first invaders from the sea.",4
1150,"The subsequent development of the jaw enabled the vertebrates to exploit a wider range of lifestyles than were available to the jawless fish, and it would not be too gross a generalization to say that much of the evolution of the vertebrates was intimately related to things that happened to jaws.",4
1151,SHARKS AND ALLIES,4
1152,The sharks and their relatives (known by the indigestible class name Elasmobranchiomorphi) are the most successful of long survivors among the vertebrates.,4
1153,"Their rapacious habits have been the subject of bloody hyperbole in films and bestsellers, so everybody knows that the shark has ranks of  fearsome, pointed teeth, an elegant, incessant swishing swimming motion, a tail with a long ‘point’ uppermost, and a big appetite.",4
1154,"Their skeleton is made of cartilage — bone has not ‘grown into’ the cartilage, as in the higher vertebrates.",4
1155,Their true jaws are of obvious advantage for grasping prey.,4
1156,"Cartilage does not preserve as fossil as a rule, so most of the evidence of the shark-like fish rests upon teeth.",4
1157,Sharks of essentially modern type go back to the Jurassic.,4
1158,"In the later Palaeozoic a number of shark-like fish include some related to living forms, others whose zoological position is still a puzzle.",4
1159,"The Devonian are an especially exciting group of fish (p. 4) with powerful, armour-plated heads and frequently fang-like teeth, the function of which is obviously predatory.",4
1160,The lower jaw of these fish is loosely slung to the brain case they had a very wide ‘gape’.,4
1161,The trunk was also protected with a shield.,4
1162,"This group may include the distant ancestors of the sharks, but they must have been somewhat ponderous animals compared with the streamlined hunters of modern seas.",4
1163,"Most of them were dogfish-sized, but was twice the length of a man, and was surely the most formidable predator of its day.",4
1164,Sharks of modern type replace their worn teeth with new ones by a sort of conveyor belt system.,4
1165,"Isolated, bladed shark's teeth are really rather frequent finds in Mesozoic and Tertiary rocks, often in the absence of any other fish remains.",4
1166,They have a handsome shiny lustre which makes them conspicuous from a distance.,4
1167,"The rays are related to sharks, and are in essence sharks that have been ‘squashed’ flat life as rather sluggish bottom dwellers.",4
1168,"The mollusc-crushing teeth of rays, with the same lustre as shark's teeth, but formed as low, ridged cushions, can also be found in Mesozoic and younger rocks.",4

1177,"BONY FISH — OSTEICHTHYES (Colour plates 46, 48, 49)",4
1178,Every experience with an unfilleted kipper demonstrates the aptness of the general name of this group.,4
1179,"The vast majority of living fish belong here (18,000 species or so), which rival the insects in their multitude of adaptations and variety of external form.",4
1180,"They can live in hot springs, or can be dredged from the deepest abyssal depths of the ocean; the latter are grotesque gargoyles that seem to belong in the paintings of Heironymus Bosch.",4
1181,"Some are rapid swimmers gathered together in silvery shoals, others sluggish bottom dwellers spending most of their time buried in sediment.",4
1182,"Most have a characteristic arrangement of paired fins, but these can be lost, or fantastically modified to form fans or poisonous barbs.",4
1183,Most species are a few centimetres to a few tens of centimetres long.,4
1184,Their rapidity of evolution is well known: dozens of species have evolved in African fresh water lakes within the last million years.,4
1185,"They have as wide a range of life habits as any group, from scavengers, grazers, filter feeders, vegetarians, omnivores, to fierce predators with reputations to rival that of the sharks.",4
1186,"A coating of is characteristic, and the gills are covered by a movable flap (the ).",4
1187,It would be difficult to overestimate the importance of the bony fish in the economy of the sea.,4
1188,"Fish of various sizes feed on the plankton (and on ), and themselves are food for larger predators, seals and many whales, and man.",4
1189,"Many of them have bizarre adaptations, as parasites, or as permanent ‘guests’ within particular species of coral or sponge, which it would be impossible to infer from fossil remains.",4
1190,"Many have good sight, but there are a few forms which have lost their eyes, some of them living in the lightless world of caves.",4
1191,"Considering their abundance in the oceans and rivers today, bony fish fossils are rather rare, and poorly reflect their true importance.",4
1192,"Where they occur, however, they are found in large numbers, and in variety.",4
1193,"Presumably these sites were protected from the kinds of influence that normally destroy fish remains, the activity of scavenging animals that disarticulate the skeletons, or currents.",4
1194,The classic fish sites produce fossils of quite outstanding beauty (see Plate 49) and ones which have considerable monetary value.,4
1195,"The fish of the Eocene and later are clearly related to today's fauna, and some relatives of the living groups can be found in Mesozoic rocks.",4
1196,"The classification of bony fish is extremely complicated, particularly fitting in the fossil forms, and there are many bones of contention (literally!).",4
1197,The group as a whole goes back to the Devonian (?,4
1198,"Silurian) period, and from rocks of this age predatory fish (and allies) have been recovered.",4
1199,Some living survivors of these early forms include the sturgeons and bichirs (the former have reverted to a cartilage skeleton).,4
1200,"The early fossil bony fish have tails with the long blade uppermost, whereas the more advanced living bony fish have a tail that is symmetrical, and more effective in producing a horizontal thrust.",4
1201,The surface of their body was covered with an interlocking series of shiny scales (‘ganoid’) which are still found in the bichir.,4
1202,"One important division of bony fishes includes the lungfish and the ‘lobe-finned’ fishes (including the coelacanth, the most famous of living fossils).",4
1203,"This group of fish was also fully fledged in the Devonian, and this is of particular significance because the origin of all land vertebrates has been considered as lying within a species of this group.",4
1204,"The freshwater lungfish retain their lungs, which help them to survive periods of drying in the rivers in which they live.",4
1205,Many fish specialists believe that in the Devonian all the bony fishes had lungs (and that the swim bladder of the recent forms was a modification of the early breathing apparatus).,4
1206,"It is not an easy business to identify the actual ancestor of the land-going organisms, and perhaps it has not yet been found.",4
1207,"For many years there have been proponents of the theory that one of the ‘lobe-finned’ fishes included the ancestor of the tetrapods, and it is not difficult to imagine their stumpy fins, with a fleshy core, making the uneasy transition into a walking leg.",4
1208,"Other features do not agree with this, and recently there has been a swing to favour the lungfishes as nearer the origin of amphibians and, ultimately, ourselves.",4
1209,"Whatever momentous steps they took in the Devonian, the lungfish and lobe fins have been very conservative since, for the living lungfish are clearly similar to their Palaeozoic relatives and coelacanth lobe fins like the living genus () are known from Cretaceous rocks.",4

1211,AMPHIBIANS —CLASS AMPHIBIA (Colour plate 51),4
1212,"Frogs, newts, and salamanders are living amphibians.",4
1213,The frogs are one  of the most diverse of the higher vertebrate groups and peculiarly endearing animals with their lugubrious expressions and vocabulary of squeaks and belches.,4
1214,"Yet the amphibia as a whole represent an early level of terrestrial organization; they are tied to water for reproduction, because their larvae have to pass through a wholly subaqueous phase, and of the adult is a constant danger.",4
1215,The amphibians had their origins in one of the freshwater lung-carrying fishes in the Devonian.,4
1216,"We have to visualize the process of change as a gradual one, with progressive forays from the water, until the first animal with true limbs developed (the bony elements of the limb are present in the fish fin).",4
1217,From the Devonian of Greenland and other localities comes a true four-legged animal (tetrapod) that is not far from the ‘fish with legs’ we might have visualized (which is commemorated in its name —).,4
1218,But as always it is not quite that simple.,4
1219,"The transition from water to land required not only the perfection of a walking limb, but modifications to the hearing system, palate, eyes , and had already established most of these terrestrial modifications, so it is in no sense an ‘ancestor’, although it has many ancestral features.",4
1220,Bony scales were inherited from its ancestors and this helped the animal against .,4
1221,"The subsequent history of the amphibians includes a further development of terrestrial forms, but others remained wholly or partly aqueous.",4
1222,These flourished in the waterlogged swamps of the Carboniferous period.,4
1223,"The earliest amphibians were certainly predators, and there was suitable prey both on land and in the water.",4
1224,"Bony fish,, Cretaceous This little fish is preserved in a soft, pale grey shale Like many shale specimens it is flattened, but the still-water conditions under which the rock was deposited have permitted complete preservation of a delicate skeleton.",4
1225,"This fish has a rather expanded, frog-like head behind which there are prominent fins; a slender body, which is flexible, supported by a host of tiny ribs, which are clearly visible.",4
1226,"A number of related fossil species are known from cretaceous rocks This species is from Cretaceous fish beds in Turga, Nertchinsk, Siberia.",4
1227,Similar species occur in Mongolia and China.,4
1228,It is 6 cm long.,4
1229,"The Carboniferous is popularly known as the ‘Age of Amphibians’, and it is true that the amphibians reached a dominance in the vertebrate world at this time which they never again equalled.",4
1230,"All of the walking species had the widely-splayed legs that gave them a slow and lumbering gait, but, in the absence of more streamlined animals, they prospered.",4
1231,The group informally known as (from their characteristic labyrinth-ridged teeth) included some impressive animals almost a man: perhaps the alligators of the time.,4
1232,"Most of the fossils recovered are of wholly or partly aquatic amphibians, the sort that were easily preserved in the coal swamps that were characteristic of the Carboniferous non-marine environment.",4
1233,"Other environments, particularly later in the Permian period, which was one of general ‘drying  out’, probably included species that were more truly terrestrial in their habits.",4
1234,"But even during the Carboniferous the first true reptiles had evolved, and this was the group that was to make itself wholly independent of the water.",4
1235,The living amphibians have turned the limitations of the aqueous connection to advantage.,4
1236,"Frogs have their origins in the Triassic (they are a relatively recent amphibian innovation, and highly specialized).",4
1237,"Their tadpoles can exploit bodies of water not excessively populated with competitors, and some are adapted to very restricted niches.",4
1238,"The adult frogs have a different diet (worms, flies, etc.), and the species therefore get ‘the best of both worlds’.",4
1239,Frogs throng in almost any site with high humidity and standing pools of water.,4
1240,"The large amphibians of the Palaeozoic did not survive beyond the Permian, and so our inferences about their modes of life have to be made entirely from the bony fossils that survive.",4
1241,"Palaeontologists recognize fossil Palaeozoic amphibians from their teeth, their flattened skulls and the arrangements of bones on the skulls.",4
1242,"They are not generally common fossils, but there is always a chance of turning up a skeleton from the coal deposits, or finding a fossil frog (Fig. 51) in the Mesozoic.",4
1243,REPTILES — CLASS REPTILIA,4
1244,"The living reptiles are almost all predators, and the vast majority are also small, the only giants remaining being the crocodiles, alligators and caymans (and one or two big lizards).",4
1245,"We tend to think of the reptiles as somehow past their ‘prime’, but it would be more accurate to say that they had been displaced from the top jobs in nature, while more than holding their own in the shop floor.",4
1246,"The warmer the climate the more they are in evidence, because the living reptiles are ‘cold blooded’(without their own internal heat regulator) and they cannot successfully live in very cold climates.",4
1247,"Living snakes and lizards are highly varied, and manage to live in some environments (e.g. dry deserts) where the mammals are pushed to survive.",4
1248,"Most living reptiles and all of the primitive ones lay eggs, and this egg, from which perfectly-formed baby reptiles hatch, marks the complete emancipation from the necessity of returning to water for reproduction.",4
1249,And a scaly skin solves the problem of drying out even in intense heat.,4
1250,"Add to this the change in orientation of the legs in many reptiles, which can be used in an efficient running action, unlike the ungainly waddling of the amphibians and it will be apparent why the reptiles were better adapted to terrestrial life than the amphibians, and why they largely displaced them.",4
1251,"This was instantaneous, and the Permian period saw both advanced amphibians and early reptiles living side by side.",4
1252,"The reptiles were probably derived from an amphibious ancestor, probably early in the Carboniferous.",4
1253,"Once established they underwent a number of evolutionary ‘bursts’ in which diverse kinds of reptiles occupied a variety of habitats, the most spectacular of which was the dinosaur radiation in the Mesozoic, to which we shall return later.",4
1254,of the large reptiles that are found in the Mesozoic rocks are dinosaurs — the reptile groups that took up life in the sea or the air were only distantly related.,4
1255,"One of the most important steps for the complete colonization of the land was the evolution of (plant-eating) reptiles, tapping a prolific and nourishing source of food that opened up a new dimension to the ‘food chain'.",4
1256,"Larger and better herbivores meant larger and more ferocious carnivores to prey upon them, scavengers to clean up the mess, and a whole host of subordinate trades for other animals.",4
1257,"The reptiles underwent tremendous changes in their skeletal structure, their jaws and their teeth during over their history of two hundred million years, some of the predators developing razor sharp rows of fangs, other herbivores losing their teeth and acquiring beak-like jaws.",4
1258,"At some time in the Permo-Triassic one group of reptiles (‘mammal-like reptiles’) actually gave rise to the warm-blooded mammals, which were to lead a rather subordinate existence during the heyday of the dinosaurs.",4
1259,And the birds probably had their origin in a particular group of dinosaurs.,4
1260,"So in a sense the reptile dominance is still with us, transmuted by time and evolution.",4
1261,"The scenes of Jurassic or Cretaceous landscapes in picture books show dinosaurs swarming over the landscape, giving the impression that we know the whole story.",4
1262,"The truth is that there a few sites (especially in North America) where abundant remains of complete animals have been recovered, and from which a passable idea of the fauna of the Mesozoic can be obtained, but there are still great gaps in our knowledge, and many of the dinosaurs are known from a handful of individuals, or even a single specimen.",4

1356,"there is little chance of an amateur collector acquiring an appreciable part of one of these great animals, but in the right site fragments of dinosaur skeletons may be picked up.",4
1357,"The term ‘dinosaur’ includes a number of really rather separate groups of animals, with more or less independent evolutionary history during the Jurassic and Cretaceous.",4
1358,"The real giants were the lumbering , etc.), four-legged dinosaurs, with enormously long necks only matched by equally long tails.",4
1359,The giant predators that walked on their hind legs (and other theropods) share structures of the hip bones with the sauropods that show they are more closely related to them than to the rest of the dinosaurs.,4
1360,"These latter (Ornithischians) include some animals that walked on their hind legs like , but with vegetarian habits (, the first dinosaur to be discovered); the group also includes various types of vegetarian armoured and plated dinosaurs, often shown in pitched battle with their carnivorous contemporaries.",4
1361,"These well-protected dinosaurs each diversified into a number of genera; the three main groups are: the stegosaurs of the Jurassic, with paired plates along the back and a nastily spiked tail (); the ceratopsians, horned, rhinoceros-like dinosaurs of the Cretaceous, including the familiar ; the spiky armoured ankylosaurs, tanks on stumpy legs.",4
1362,"Specialized ornithischians in the late Cretaceous were the remarkable duck-billed dinosaurs, animals that lost their front teeth and had arrays of tiny grinding teeth at the back of the jaw that were continually replaced, like those of the shark, and must have been able to cope with tough vegetation.",4
1363,Some of the duck-billed forms  evolved crests and protuberances their heads.,4
1364,"All the dinosaurs, vegetarian and carnivore alike, became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period (p. 135).",4
1365,A whole range of other reptiles were present in the Jurassic and Cretaceous; none of them are dinosaurs.,4
1366,"They include the products of the spread of the reptiles back into the aqueous environment from which their distant ancestors emerged, and, for the first time in the history of the vertebrates, the conquest of the air.",4
1367,"The marine , with their long flexible necks and sharp teeth, were formidable hunters of Mesozoic fish.",4
1368,"The limbs were modified into efficient paddles, perfectly adapted for sculling through the water.",4
1369,"Even more streamlined for marine life were the ichthyosaurs ('fish lizards'), which, as their name implies, include species that look remarkably fish-like, although perhaps the better analogy would be with the porpoises, a group of mammals that ‘returned to the sea’, and may fill a similar role in modern seas to that of the ichthyosaurs in the Jurassic.",4
1370,"These marine reptiles have a higher chance of preservation than many of the terrestrial species, and their carcasses often seem to have sunk to the sea floor, some localities have yielded numerous complete specimens.",4
1371,The Liassic (Lower Jurassic) rocks of Europe furnished many of the magnificent specimens which are now on display in museums.,4
1372,"Some of the ichthyosaurs include baby individuals within their skeletons which either implies cannabalistic habits, or, more probably, the ability to give birth to their young alive.",4
1373,Isolated vertebrae of marine reptiles (Fig.50) are one of the reptilian fossils that are the easiest to collect.,4
1374,"The pterosaurs, flying reptiles, also had their origins in the Triassic and became widespread and varied during the Jurassic and Cretaceous.",4
1375,"Like the bats, the pterosaurs had membranous wings stretched between highly modified arms and ‘hands’ and the fore part of the legs; unlike the bats some of them grew to an enormous size and the front support for the wing was provided by only one finger of the hand, grotesquely extended.",4
1376,"Most of them, and particularly the larger ones, combined slow, flapping flight with gliding, spending a large part of their lives effortlessly aloft.",4
1377,"As in the case of the sauropod dinosaurs they seem to have got bigger and bigger during the Cretaceous — some of these later pterosaurs are supposed to have had wing spans exceeding lo metres, which would make them almost comparable to a man-made glider.",4
1378,Why this large size evolved is something of a mystery: it may have been that larger gliders cruise at slower speeds without ‘stalling’.,4
1379,Quite how these amazing animals landed and took off (if they did) can only be guessed at.,4
1380,"Like the plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs, they were successful and varied for a long time, but all three groups failed to survive the Cretaceous.",4
1381,"Examples of the two major kinds of dinosaurs, showing the structure of the hip bones which distinguishes them.",4

1384,"Crocodiles and lizards have a fossil record extending back to the Triassic, snakes to the Cretaceous.",4
1385,The turtles and tortoises have almost as long a history as the crocodiles.,4

1388,MAMMALS — CLASS MAMMALIA,4
1389,"Mammals animals with mammary glands that suckle their young — were certainly present during the Triassic, and were a continuous if subordinate component of fossil faunas throughout the acme of the dinosaurs.",4
1390,It was only after the demise of the ruling reptiles that the class had the opportunity to capitalize on the evolutionary advantages which propelled them to the dominance they have enjoyed ever since.,4
1391,"Many of the early mammals were probably insect eaters, as are many of the primitive representatives of the group today.",4
1392,"Small mammals were present in the Triassic — shrew-like animals with long noses, and probably insatiable appetites for smaller items of the fauna.",4
1393,We can imagine animals like these darting through the undergrowth food while the colossal reptiles lumbered obliviously around them.,4
1394,"It would be wrong to suppose that there was no evolutionary activity among these early mammals: in fact there were considerable changes, which by the late Cretaceous had established early members of several of the principal groups of mammals which dominate the terrestrial world today.",4
1395,"The marsupial (pouched) and placental (womb-bearing) mammals had separated, and lived side by side.",4
1396,Many of the early mammalian remains are fossil teeth.,4
1397,"More than those of any other vertebrate group, the teeth of mammals have changed in distinctive ways, and the different types of mammals can be reliably identified from a study of their dentition alone.",4
1398,"This is particularly fortunate, because teeth have a high fossilization potential, exceeding that of other parts of the skeleton.",4
1399,The sediments filling caves or fissures in limestone are frequently repositories for fossil teeth.,4
1400,Sampling for mammal fossils often involves the patient sieving of great quantities of sediment to extract the fossil teeth.,4
1401,If you are very lucky you might find a whole jaw (p. 100).,4
1402,"Mammal jaws often have specialized teeth for particular jobs — nipping, chewing, biting, gnawing teeth — which function in perfect cooperation between the upper and lower jaws.",4
1403,Mammal teeth often have distinctive patterns of crests or bumps () that serve to identify large groups within the mammals.,4
1404,"Teeth for grinding vegetation are often large and ridged, while the rodents have their fast-growing gnawing teeth at the front of the jaw.",4
1405,"The most specialized dental structures of all are probably the baleen plates of the largest whales, modified for straining plankton from sea water.",4
1406,"The evolution of mammals after the Cretaceous was both extremely rapid and very complex, and we can do no more than give the roughest sketch here.",4
1407,"Compared with what was happening in contemporary marine invertebrates, the visible changes in mammalian skeletons during the early part of the Tertiary were fast and dramatic; it did not take long before the roles of larger herbivores and carnivores were filled by mammalian animals.",4
1408,"By the end of the Palaeocene, only a few million years from the Cretaceous extinction of the giant reptiles, there were representatives of many of the living mammalian orders, including, , the primates (the order to which man belongs), the carnivores (cats dogs, and most living predators) and the rodents (rats, mice).",4
1409,"The history of the mammals in the Tertiary involved not only this one major diversification, but several, with major extinctions between, the largest mammals of the earlier parts of the Tertiary are not related to the large mammals of the Recent.",4
1410,The roots of our present European fauna extend back to the Miocene.,4
1411,The whole story is complicated by the fact that this was also the time of break-up of the supercontinent Pangaea.,4
1412,"Mammalian faunas on isolated continental fragments could evolve, for a time, separately from faunas in other parts of the world, producing a whole series of peculiar animals that have no direct relationships to animals with a similar mode of life elsewhere.",4
1413,"The obvious example is Australia, which was separated early, and in which the marsupial mammals had the opportunity to adapt to a whole range of ecological niches, which they managed with remarkable success a low cranial capacity and a primitive mode of reproduction.",4
1414,Some of the largest marsupials () seem to have survived to a time tantalisingly close to the present.,4
1415,"Similarly, in South America a whole range of peculiar mammals evolved largely in isolation, including giant sloths, specialized grazing species, and the extraordinary glyptodonts (p. 100).",4
1416,"A lot of argument among mammalian palaeontologists  seems to centre on how and when links between North America, Europe and Asia existed, resulting in interchange and invasions of animals between the two regions.",4
1417,"It is clear that some groups of animals, like the proboscideans (elephants and allies), are much reduced now compared with the late Tertiary, both in variety and geographic distribution.",4
1418,"A late stimulus for the evolution of distinctive mammals was the Pleistocene Ice Age, although a variety also became extinct at this time.",4
1419,"A number of species, adapted to the widespread cold conditions, roamed widely around the northern hemisphere, including woolly mammoths and rhinoceros, and extinct species of tigers.",4
1420,"On the other hand interglacial periods were very much than conditions in temperate latitudes today, and these climatic fluctuations resulted in periods when hippopotamus and tropical rhinoceros thrived in the areas occupied by Europe's capital cities today.",4
1421,"With the final retreat of the ice many of the cold climate specialists perished (possibly with the help of man), although some of the species that accompany them, like lemmings or musk ox, survive today in the harsh conditions of the arctic tundra.",4
1422,BIRDS — CLASS AVES,4
1423,"Fossil birds are distinctly rare, and to find a well-preserved and complete example is a palaeontological event.",4
1424,"The evolution of flight led to generally light and fragile skeletons, and it is perhaps not surprising that avian fossils are so uncommon, and when found, so often fragmentary.",4
1425,"The derivation of the birds from a reptilian (possibly dinosaur) ancestor is certain, and because the earliest fossil bird,, is Jurassic in age, it is usually assumed that the split from the reptiles occurred in the earlier part of the period.",4
1426,"Unfortunately, there is much that is not understood about the history of the birds between (p. 101) and the good assemblages of fossil birds undoubtedly related to living species in the   Eocene and Miocene.",4
1427,"Cretaceous birds are generally scarce, and some of the ‘toothed’ birds that are known, like the flightless, aquatic , seem to be difficult to relate to any of the living species.",4
1428,"It is probable that like the mammals the roots of the great variety of living birds are to be found in the Cretaceous, but fossils, which could document this, are only now slowly coming to light.",4
1429,"The Berlin skeleton of the early bird,",4
1430,"Some of the specialized mammals which evolved in isolation in South America: top ; middle,; bottom,",4
1431,"Lower jaw of Pleistocene bear showing typical mammalian specialization of teeth: sharp canines, chewing teeth at the rear",4
1432,FOSSIL PLANTS,4
1433,The fossils of plants are some of the most attractive that the amateur collector is likely to find.,4
1434,"Those plants that concern us here were terrestrial or lived in bogs, rivers or lakes.",4
1435,"Like animals that dwelt on land, the terrestrial flora also arose from ancestors that lived in the seas, a change that is known to have happened before the end of the Silurian.",4
1436,"However, marine algae were very important in the early history of the evolution of the earth, and they are described in some detail in Chapters 7 and 8.",4
1437,They are not generally conspicuous fossils in the field.,4
1438,"A few algae, however, produced hard calcareous skeletons, and were abundant enough to produce small gardens beneath the sea.",4
1439,"Such (Plate 52) have a long history, extending back into the Precambrian, and they are still numerous today.",4
1440,"They were often components of reefs, and in some environments it is the algae that bear the full brunt of the attack by the breakers on the exposed, seaward side of the reef.",4
1441,They are also important rock builders; in northerly latitudes today limestones are being formed from the skeletal debris of such calcareous algae as .,4
1442,The first land plants must have been derived from a marine alga.,4
1443,"We have to visualize this as a very gradual process, the early transitional plants perhaps creeping across mud flats, or partially submerged.",4
1444,"The change involved the production of a protective ‘skin’ to ensure that water loss to the atmosphere was not excessive, and the stems had to acquire sufficient rigidity to stand up without the support of surrounding water, but also the cellular structure had to allow the passage of nutrients to the growing shoots (ultimately, a system).",4
1445,The evolution of such a plant could not have been achieved at a single stroke.,4
1446,Reproduction in these early plants was minute spores.,4
1447,"Quite a variety of Silurian plants are now known, and by the end of the Devonian it is apparent that most of the problems of terrestrial living had been solved, to the extent that large tree ‘ferns’ of the time would have had dimensions comparable with forest trees today.",4
1448,"The fossil record of plants is not good enough simply to ‘read out’ the story of their evolution by collecting from successively younger, non-marine rock formations.",4
1449,"Some of the earliest plants do not appear to be the most primitive, and .",4
1450,"True, there is a general drift through time towards more complex plants, more perfectly adapted to life water, but primitive species have persisted alongside the innovations.",4
1451,The fossil record is full of curious plants that do not fit comfortably into classifications — this is one of the things that makes the study of fossil plants so fascinating.,4
1452,"Consequently there are arguments among botanists about the relationships of many plants, living and fossil, and some classifications have quite large categories containing only a few plants, which may be rare.",4
1453,"Not all of the major groups will be described here, but only those that are likely to be found by the non-specialist collector.",4
1454,"Some important groups, like the mosses and liverworts, have a sporadic fossil record extending back to the Carboniferous, but they are not likely to be encountered without a special search.",4
1455,"Plant fossils are often to be found in particular beds, reflecting conditions of deposition that were just right for their preservation.",4
1456,", the rocks that contain abundant plant remains are mostly those which were deposited in freshwater lakes, or on deltas, or the fossilized remains of peat beds.",4
1457,"There were probably plants living in hilly regions from quite early which have left little fossil record, and this may account for some of the gaps in the preserved fossils.",4
1458,"Many fossil plants are now more or less black, carbonized (‘coalified’) compressions.",4
1459,"In some cases, however, the fine structure, even down to individual cells, is splendidly preserved, and these are the most important specimens from a scientific point of view.",4
1460,The problems of associating the different organs of the same fossil plant species were mentioned earlier in this book (p. 23)..,4
1461,"Seed fern,, Carboniferous.",4
1462,These fossil seeds are preserved in a relatively coarse-grained sandstone.,4
1463,"Although they are uncrushed, only parts of the original seed covering remain — they are largely internal moulds.",4
1464,"They are the seeds produced by the fern-like plants , but because they are difficult to link with their foliage they have been given separate names.",4
1465,The three raised ridges on their surface are typical.,4
1466,Seeds of similar type have been found associated with a number of the Carboniferous seed-fern leaves.,4
1467,"They are from Ayrshire, Scotland; length, 2 cm",4
1468,EARLY LAND PLANTS — DIVISION PSILOPHYTA,4
1469,"The earliest land plants, to be found in Silurian and Devonian rocks, had simple shoots that arose from a creeping ‘axis’, which were little different in structure from the shoots themselves.",4
1470,"Leaves, if they were  present , were humble scales or spine-like projections.",4
1471,"The upright twigs often branched in a simple way, forking into two, and then into two again, and sometimes terminating in little capsules that carried the spores.",4
1472,"The plants are often preserved as dark markings on shales, and were less than half a metre in length.",4
1473,"The best-preserved examples, from which their cellular construction has been described, are from the Devonian Rhynie Chert (p. 17).",4
1474,FERNS — DIVISION PTEROPHYTA (Colour plate 60),4
1475,"Some of the commoner types of fern-like foliage from the Carboniferous Such foliage often belongs to the seed ferns, the true ferns",4
1476,"The feathery and delicate fronds of the ferns make them among the most beautiful of the foliage plants, and they attract a fanatical group of devotees dedicated to growing exotic species in inhospitable cities.",4
1477,"They are also a very ancient group, with many Carboniferous representatives and a number of preferns in the Devonian (plate 59).",4
1478,Then as now they are generally preferred humid environments in which to live.,4
1479,"They reproduce minute spores, which form in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, or sometimes on specially modified fronds.",4
1480,"To be really sure that one is dealing with a fossil fern it should be possible to see the spore cases, because other kinds of plants can produce fern-like foliage.",4
1481,"In practice, many of the fossil fronds that one finds are sterile, and for these there a number of , units of classification based on the shape of the fronds alone (p. 23).",4
1482,"Although many ferns are low herbaceous plants, they have periodically attained the dimensions of trees; forests of such tree ferns exist today in humid regions, in New Zealand.",4
1483,Large ferns were present as early as the Upper Devonian and different genera as large or larger were significant components of forests during the Carboniferous to Cenozoic.,4
1484,"In these cases one never finds a whole tree fossilized, and it is necessary to piece together the whole plant by making intelligent guesses about whether a frond of one kind is persistently found with a particular fossil trunk.",4
1485,SEED FERNS — DIVISION PTERIDOSPERMOPHYTA (Colour plate 57),4
1486,"Many of the fern-like fronds that can be found in Carboniferous rocks belong to an extinct group of plants sharing a common ancestor with the ferns, but distinct enough to be regarded as entirely separate.",4
1487,These seed ferns had much-enlarged female reproductive bodies — forming true seeds which were fertilized by pollen born on separate organs.,4
1488,"Some of the seeds hung like bells from the ends of the ferny frond, and in some species they were several centimetres long.",4
1489,"The plants were generally bushy shrubs, but some may have been climbers, and others robust enough to form small trees.",4
1490,"A lot of the species belonging to the commonest of the Carboniferous and   Permian ‘leaf genera’— like and were seed ferns of this kind (true ferns), but associations of seeds with foliage are extremely rare.",4
1491,The seeds themselves (see p. 103) can be locally common.,4
1492,"Although they are commonest in rocks of the Late Palaeozoic, some Mesozoic plants have been regarded as a later branch of the seed ferns.",4
1493,"Fossil fern,, Cretaceous.",4
1494,"This delicate fern is preserved in a very fine-grained sandstone, which fractures rather irregularly.",4
1495,Slender and delicate branching patterns with many fine subdivisions are characteristic of this kind of fern.,4
1496,"There are a few similar species, known rarely from rocks of Cretaceous and Tertiary age, distinguished on the branching patterns of the fronds.",4
1497,"This specimen is from Sussex, England.",4
1498,Related forms occur in North America.,4
1499,"The total length of the frond is 12 cm, but it was originally part of a much larger plant",4
1500,"LYCOPODS — DIVISION LYCOPHYTA (Colour plates 53, 54, 56)",4
1501,"Many of the great trees of the Carboniferous were lycopods, the trunks of which contributed largely to the formation of coal.",4
1502,This large and important group of plants is represented today by a mere four genera of humble herbaceous plants —and — living fossils which have survived with little change from the Mesozoic or even the Carboniferous.,4
1503,"The lycopods have long, narrow leaves like little straps, each of which leaves a characteristic scar on the stem at its point of attachment.",4
1504,"The plants reproduced spores, which were born in cones; the spores were often of two kinds — large (female) megaspores 2 mm in diameter and much smaller (male) microspores.",4
1505,The study of the spores of these plants is important in correlating rocks of late Palaeozoic age.,4
1506,"The large trees had extensive roots, which grew nearly horizontally through the soil, repeatedly forking, and often bearing long rootlets.",4
1507,"Fossil roots (Fig. 5 6) are quite common, and may be preserved the trunks are not.",4
1508,"The distinctive patterns formed by leaf scars are visible on fossils of the bark, which is often found in coal and in the deposits overlying ones containing roots.",4
1509,"has many spiral rows of lozenge-shaped leaf scars, while has long rows of elliptical scars; both are very common fossils coal measures.",4
1510,"Cones are much rarer; these are about the size and shape of an asparagus spear, with rows of cavities, which contained spores, if they are flattened they can appear almost segmented in the manner of an arthropod fossil.",4
1511,"Some of the best specimens of trunks were preserved cell by cell in silica, and these show even the finest details if they are cut and polished.",4
1512,"The lycopods can be found in Devonian or even Silurian rocks, but they are generally uncommon in rocks younger than Permian, and all the tree species apparently disappeared before the end of the Palaeozoic.",4
1513,HORSETAILS —ARTHROPHYTA (Colour plate 58),4
1514,"On any walk through a bog or fen one can see the delicate shoots of the horsetails, looking almost like miniature fir trees, sometimes clustering into dense masses.",4
1515,"If one plucks a piece from one of these plants it will almost certainly break along one of the numerous joints that divide the whole plant into segments, right to the tips of the branchlets.",4
1516,"These joints give the arthrophytes (‘jointed plants’) their scientific name, and the little whorls of tiny branches produce the bushy appearance which accounts for their popular one.",4
1517,There is only one living genus of horsetails —— although its many species are very widespread.,4
1518,"The group were formerly varied and numerous, and even included trees perhaps 20 metres in height.",4
1519,"The horsetails reproduce spores, which are born in small cone-like structures at the tip of the branches or on modified shoots.",4
1520,"They are among the easiest of fossil plants to recognize, for even flattened stems retain the characteristic jointing, and the feathery distal branches cannot be mistaken for anything else.",4
1521,"The flattened whorls are particularly easy to recognize, and are frequently encountered in the soft, dark shales associated with coal seams.",4
1522,As with so many of the primitive plants the arthrophytes had their heyday in the Carboniferous after a probable origin in the Devonian.,4
1523,"Because they are common in aquatic environments they have a rather good fossil record, and are not uncommon in freshwater sediments of Jurassic and Cretaceous age.",4
1524,It is a mystery why only one genus of this formerly diverse group should have had the capacity to survive to the present day.,4
1525,CYCAD-LIKE PLANTS,4
1526,"In the forests of the Mesozoic there were large numbers of trees and shrubby plants that looked at first glance like palm trees, with leafless stems crowned with bouquets of stiff, large leaves, deeply divided into long, unbranched leaflets.",4
1527,These were cycads and bennettites.,4
1528,"A small number of cycad genera survive in the tropical and subtropical regions today, but they are much less conspicuous today than they were 120 million years ago.",4
1529,"The resemblance to palms is no indication of their true relationships, because the cycad-like plants were not true flowering plants like palms.",4
1530,"They do, however, have a most extraordinary fructification, a large knob arising from  the centre of the crown, looking something like a corncob, and bearing numerous, very large seeds.",4
1531,"Nowadays botanists divide the cycad-like plants into two major groups which may not be particularly closely related: the Cycadales, which include the living species, and the Bennettitales, an important Mesozoic group of plants which have smaller fructifications scattered among the bases of the leaves.",4
1532,"Marie Stopes, who later became a famous pioneer of birth control started life as a palaeobotanist interested in the cycads.",4
1533,"Some specimens of the trunks of bennettites (p 107) are among the most spectacular of fossils, and they even attracted the attention of the Etruscans, who included them among their sacred relics four thousand years ago!",4
1534,"The amateur collector is most likely to come across the cycad foliage, with its characteristic narrow central rib and flat leaflets.",4
1535,"Their fossils are commonest in Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks.",4
1536,"Reconstruction of a Carboniferous coal swamp, showing large lycopod and cordaite trees, an amphibian, giant dragonfly and millipede",4
1537,CONIFERS — DIVISION CONIFEROPHYTA,4
1538,The conifers are as varied and successful a group of plants today as they have ever  been.,4
1539,"But again they are an ancient group with ancestors back in the Carboniferous forest, a melting pot for plant evolution.",4
1540,"Botanists are not fully in accord about how many separate groups of plants there are within the conifers, and they are all lumped together here.",4
1541,"The fir cones of modern species will be familiar to the reader, often littering forests in their thousands, and containing seeds, which may be equipped with wings.",4
1542,"The close, needle foliage of most modern conifers, which seems as much immune to desert heat as arctic cold, was probably derived from lusher leaves in the later Palaeozoic.",4
1543,"In the Carboniferous swamps large trees with leaves, of the genus grew to 30 or more metres in height, with long slim trunks terminating in branches that bore strap-shaped leaves a metre in length.",4
1544,The cordaite ‘cone’ was a longer and more complex structure than that of any living conifer.,4
1545,"The leaves of this tree are rather common fossils, striped with longitudinal veins that give it a superficial resemblance to the leaf of an iris.",4
1546,Most of the steps leading to the modern conifers   seem to have taken place by the end of the Palaeozoic; no other group of organisms of such antiquity has retained such an unbroken hold over vast areas of the earth as the conifers.,4
1547,"Some primitive conifers, like the monkey-puzzle tree Araucaria, have survived with little change since the Triassic.",4
1548,"Large trunk of a bennettite , Cretaceous, USA.",4
1549,These conspicuous fossils are often over half a metre across.,4
1550,"Varied shapes of leaves of fossil ginkgos, typically Mesozoic, with photograph of fossil example, natural size ().",4
1551,"Frond of a cycad,, Jurassic.",4
1552,The fossil is preserved on the surface of a fine-grained siltstone.,4
1553,"There are many other fragments of plants in the same block, but the frond is unusually complete.",4
1554,Cycad leaves have characteristic flattened leaflets arranged in rows on a very slender axis.,4
1555,There are a number of species of from the Jurassic distinguished on the form of the leaflets.,4
1556,"Related genera include many species with a wide distribution, and there are living representatives occurring in tropical regions today.",4
1557,"This specimen is from the famous plant beds of Yorkshire, England.",4
1558,"Other well-known bennettite localities are the Black Hills of Dakota and from Maryland, USA.",4
1559,The frond has a length of 15 cm.,4
1560,"The long-leafed plant (Plate 55) is something of a botanical puzzle, but probably belongs within this broad group.",4
1561,"It is common in later Palaeozoic rocks of South Africa, peninsular India, Australia and South America, and is thought to have lived almost exclusively in the cooler areas of the supercontinent Pangaea (p. 32).",4
1562,The ginkgos are often placed in a separate group.,4
1563,"They are represented today only by the maidenhair tree , one of the obligatory ‘living fossils’ to be found in every botanical garden, and many parks in inner cities.",4
1564,"Ginkgo leaves are particularly beautiful, perfect fans with splayed veins, and specimens of this general type are found in many localities from rocks of Triassic age onwards (p. 108).",4
1565,"The Mesozoic ginkgos were a varied and numerous group of plants, but unlike the spruces and pines they slowly declined in variety throughout the Tertiary.",4
1566,FLOWERING PLANTS — DIVISION ANTHOPHYTA (Colour plates 61 64),4
1567,"The flowering plants dominate the floral world today, except perhaps in the lonely spruce stands of the Arctic.",4
1568,"They are the broad-leaved trees, the grasses, and myriads of tiny creeping plants, the showy flowers which attract man and pollinating insects (p. 91) alike.",4
1569,Their diversity is truly extraordinary: in tropical forests there are hundreds of species of trees alone.,4
1570,"Yet a good deal of this diversification probably happened in the last 70 million years, during the Tertiary.",4
1571,"However, like the mammals and the birds, the flowering plants certainly originated, and probably did much of their evolutionary groundwork, during the Mesozoic and especially the Cretaceous.",4
1572,The details of their origins are still not clear.,4
1573,"For one thing, flowers do not readily fossilize — and leaves alone can be misleading.",4
1574,"The flowering plants (angiosperms) appear almost ready-made in the Cretaceous, and many of these fossils can even be placed into living genera.",4
1575,"There is still much to discover of their even earlier history, and we hope that the crucial steps did not all take place in some site where fossils have little chance of preservation.",4
1576,"Whatever their early history, fossils of flowering plants — leaves, seeds and wood — are common in rocks of Tertiary age.",4
1577,"They do not even have to be rocks deposited under fresh water conditions, because wood and seeds are perfectly capable of drifting long distances before becoming waterlogged enough to sink to the bottom of the sea.",4
1578,"Leaves, however, tend to be preserved in the deposits laid down in lakes and the like.",4
1579,"Where the sediments are fine-grained the leaves form fossils of exquisite beauty, preserving even the finest veins, which can be directly compared with the leaves of their living relatives.",4
1580,"Another mode of preservation of Tertiary plants is beneath flows of lava (Oregon and the island of Skye, ) where whole floras can be preserved in enough detail to reconstruct the detailed botanical ecology of the time.",4
1581,"Fossil plants are of great use in plotting the many shifts of climate that happened during the Tertiary: a humid-tropical flora may be found in what is now an arid region, or a warm-climate flora may be found in an area that is now decidedly cool.",4
1582,"This makes the assumption, , that the plants have not changed their habits since they were fossilized.",4
1583,"During the dramatic climatic fluctuations of the last ice age — warm to cold to warm repeated several times — the flowering plants acted as thermometers for the climate, sensitive recorders of the shifts that affected everything from beetles to man.",4
1584,"Oligocene sumac tree,.",4
1585,"These leaves are beautifully preserved in a flat-bedded and very highly fissile shale, laid down at the bottom of a fresh water lake.",4
1586,"Long, graceful leaves are divided into about twelve spindle-shaped leaflets with undivided margins, and a terminal leaflet.",4
1587,Each leaflet carries a prominent vein in the middle.,4
1588,A few other fossil species of are known from the Tertiary rocks.,4
1589,"Living sumacs are familiar in temperate regions, their leaves turning a beautiful dark red late in the year.",4
1590,"The specimen shown here is from the renowned Florissant beds of Colorado, USA.",4
1591,"Other fossil Rhus have been recovered from Eocene rocks in Colorado, Utah and California.",4
1592,The longest leaf here is 12 cm long.,4
1593,BRINGING FOSSILS BACK TO LIFE,4
1594,"In this chapter some of the ways in which palaeontologists determine the way fossil animals lived are described, reanimating the dead fragments to build up a living creature.",4
1595,"Since popular ideas of life in the past are often founded on vividly coloured reconstructions of ‘The World in the Jurassic Period’ and the like, it is important to remember that these imaginative scenes are all inferences from bones, and similar fragments.",4
1596,"In fact there is nothing fixed about such interpretations, because the way the fossils are understood may change over the years, but it is usually some time before new discoveries percolate into the popular presentations.",4
1597,Even the most solid-looking dinosaurs may have changed their habits in the last few years!,4
1598,Many different lines of evidence may be used to flesh out the bare bones of the fossils.,4
1599,The first of these is the evidence of the rocks from which the remains were recovered.,4
1600,"The sediments themselves reveal much about the environment of deposition, as was shown in Chapter 3.",4
1601,"It is important to establish whether the fossil animal actually lived in the environment which furnished its sedimentary cover, or whether its remains were swept in from some other place.",4
1602,Fortunately it is usually easy to spot such intruders.,4
1603,"The type of sediment and the associated fossils will show whether the environment was marine, freshwater or terrestrial, providing the basic information into which the ecology of the animal has to be accommodated.",4
1604,The sediments themselves may have preserved some of the tracks left by the animal (p. 20) to give direct evidence of its past activities.,4
1605,"From the tracks alone it is possible to be certain of the bipedal stance of certain dinosaurs, and to measure their stride.",4
1606,"The character of the rocks, and their setting in the past geography at the time when they accumulated, diagnoses the climatic setting in which the extinct fauna lived, and climate imposes certain restraints on possible modes of life.",4
1607,"Savannah animals differ from those of tropical rain forests, and these again from inhabitants of the tundra at high latitudes.",4
1608,"Looking at the fossil animal itself, the first necessity is to reconstruct it as accurately as possible from its fragmentary remains.",4
1609,"Sometimes this is a very complex business, particularly for vertebrates with numbers of small bones.",4
1610,To proceed from the reconstruction to an assessment of probable life habits two different but complementary approaches are used.,4
1611,One method attempts to compare the structures of teeth or limbs or some other feature of the extinct animal with living .,4
1612,These do not have to be biologically related organisms.,4
1613,The basic argument is that structures that are closely similar were probably adapted to a similar function.,4
1614,"Sometimes these similarities are quite obvious: the ferocious teeth of a predatory dinosaur are a sure indication of hunting habits, with hardly a glance at the fangs of living mammalian carnivores.",4
1615,"But the structure and functioning of grinding or chewing teeth in other mammals, in which opposing teeth co-operate in action, and which can be matched in extinct, unrelated mammals, is a much more subtle matter, involving detailed studies on the operation of living dental systems to help elucidate the functioning of fossil ones.",4
1616,"The technique of ‘hunt the analogue’ is a favourite one practised by palaeontologists, but it is certainly not a foolproof one, because there are many fossil animals that defy comparison with living organisms, and some analogues do  not stand up to detailed scrutiny.",4
1617,The second method tries to analyse the structure of the fossil almost it were a piece of engineering.,4
1618,"If the fossil is constructed in a certain way, then there are only a limited number of ‘jobs’ that the structure could perform.",4
1619,The idea here is to decide which of the possibilities is the most likely one.,4
1620,This assumes that nature only manufactures efficient designs.,4
1621,this is a reasonable assumption to make.,4
1622,"Most animals today do seem to have bodies that accord well with the functions they have to carry out to survive: flyers are aerodynamically efficient, active swimmers have suitable streamlining, herbivorous mammals have teeth appropriate for grinding plant food, .",4
1623,"Ideally one could construct a model of the fossil to test out these various functions in experiments, but the number of examples where the analysis has been pursued this far are limited.",4
1624,it can never be known whether the right answer has been reached (unless somebody dredges up a ‘living fossil’ from the depths of the ocean)— there are only varying degrees of probability.,4
1625,"But the best answers are probably obtained where the functional design of the fossil points to the same life habits as a living analogue, and where both are consistent with the geological circumstances in which the fossil remains occur.",4
1626,SWIMMING TRILOBITES,4
1627,There are thousands of different kinds of trilobites.,4
1628,All of them were marine and all of them are extinct.,4
1629,"Since many kinds of trilobites co-existed at any one time they were probably occupying different ecological niches, behaving in different ways, corresponding with the wide variation in shape that they show.",4
1630,"We can use the methods described above to elucidate some of these occupations, and get a glimpse, albeit an imperfect one, of the trilobite as it lived.",4
1631,"I will take an example where the methods can be used, and where all point in the same direction, the answer is probably correct.",4
1632,"Most trilobites were broadly oval-shaped being rather longer than wide, not greatly convex, and with eyes that occupy perhaps a quarter of the length of the head.",4
1633,"There are a few trilobite species, however, with enormous, globular eyes (see below).",4
1634,By examining the way these animals were put together it is possible to suggest a likely mode of life.,4

1636,Twice its natural size.,4
1637,Enlargement shows a section through the lenses to show the direction of the field of view.,4
1638,We can take the eyes first.,4
1639,"The trilobite eye was of a compound type, and each lens was made up of a calcite crystal.",4
1640,From the optical properties of this mineral we know that the lens was able to interpret light coming from a direction more or less at right-angles to the lens surface.,4
1641,"So we can deduce what the field of vision of our globular-eyed trilobite was, by looking at the directions in which all the lenses face.",4
1642,"It turns out that our animal was able to see in almost every direction — upwards, downwards, sideways and forwards, and even backwards, because the eyes bulged out beyond the line of the rest of the body.",4
1643,Most other trilobites have a predominantly lateral field of view.,4
1644,"If the animal lived on the sea bottom, it seems unlikely that it would have eye lenses specialized for looking , and we begin to suspect that the animal habitually dwelt above the sea floor.",4
1645,Other features of its shape are consistent with this.,4
1646,"At the   edge of the eyes are a pair of long spines, and these point downwards at a steep angle, at very awkward attitude for resting comfortably on the sea floor.",4
1647,"Most ‘normal’ trilobites have a more or less horizontal rim around the forward margin, which may have rested on the sediment surface.",4
1648,The thorax of the large-eyed trilobite is remarkably long compared with the average trilobite (compare Fig. 33).,4
1649,"The convex, middle part of the thorax contained the musculature that operated the appendages (which, , are not preserved), and the relatively large volume of this region shows that the musculature was powerful.",4
1650,"The construction of this giant-eyed trilobite suggests that it lived an actively swimming life well above the bottom, and possibly in the surface waters of the sea.",4
1651,"because there are no living trilobites we cannot find direct confirmation of this hypothesis, but we look for other arthropods that have the same modifications of the eyes, , in the present day oceans.",4

1736,Giant-eyed living crustacean (),4
1737,"If it is correct that our trilobite lived above the sea bottom, actively swimming in the water, there are certain predictions we can make about its geological occurrence which can be tested by looking in the rocks.",4
1738,"Most bottom-dwelling trilobites preferred to live at a particular water depth, or on a particular type of sea bottom (mud, sand or lime).",4
1739,No such restriction should apply to our large-eyed species; it should be found with all other different kinds of trilobite assemblages without preference.,4
1740,"This has been proved in several places: in some arctic localities it is found with trilobites that lived at great depths in the muds of the Ordovician ocean, while in Canada the same species occurs mixed with the inhabitants of the shallow-water seas, where limestones were accumulating.",4
1741,"By the same token the free-swimming trilobite may be expected to have a very wide geographical distribution, for oceans would be no barrier to it.",4
1742,"And again this proves to be the case: our example is found in Arctic Canada, in the high Arctic  island of Spitsbergen, thousands of miles away in what is now the desert country of Nevada and Utah in the United States, in western Ireland, in Russia, and in northwestern Australia.",4
1743,"So in this case the different sources of evidence all point in the same direction, whether derived from a detailed consideration of the way the trilobite is constructed, or by analogy with living animals with similar adaptations, or from the evidence of the rocks or the distribution of the fossils.",4
1744,"These giant-eyed trilobites of the Ordovician were active swimmers in the surface waters, as near certainly as we can ever know.",4
1745,"There are all kinds of different questions we can ask about the life habits of these trilobites, which are not the same kind of careful scrutiny.",4
1746,"What did they eat, ?",4
1747,"Because we do not have the legs preserved, it is not possible to see how the mouth appendages functioned in feeding, and neither are the stomach contents preserved.",4
1748,So here there are only more or less likely speculations.,4
1749,"Active swimmers in the surface waters of the present oceans are likely to feed directly on the plankton, and the trilobites may have had a method of harvesting large quantities of minute food.",4
1750,"Or they may have been hunters after larger prey, in which case when appendages are eventually discovered they may prove to have adaptations for grasping and manipulating larger food.",4
1751,"Puzzles remain, we can be certain of the rudiments of the story.",4
1752,CONTROVERSY AMONG THE GIANT DINOSAURS,4
1753,The giant sauropod dinosaurs like were the largest land animals the world has seen they weighed 80 tonnes and present quite different problems in the interpretation of their life habits from the diminutive trilobites.,4
1754,"Such spectacular animals have obviously attracted much attention, and one might suppose that the problem of how they lived would have been satisfactorily solved long ago.",4
1755,"Most of the popular books showing the Mesozoic giants in their natural setting portray them wallowing about in swamps flanked by deep vegetation, their bodies largely under water.",4
1756,"Surely an animal of this bulk, it was argued, must be partly supported by water, and their relatively inconsequential teeth must have been adapted for chewing on the kind of soft, luxuriant vegetation that flourishes in and around swamps.",4
1757,Because their nasal openings were on the top of their heads they could even continue to breathe if it became necessary (p. 115) to totally submerge.,4
1758,Recently the life habits of the giants have been looked at in a way that disproves most of these traditional notions.,4
1759,Consider the structure of their legs.,4
1760,"The sauropods have relatively long, pillar-like legs, resembling those of the elephant, the largest land animal, and may have been well adapted for supporting the huge bulk of the animal.",4
1761,"The feet of the sauropod are small (relatively speaking!), with short, stubby toes, yet animals that walk on soft mud tend to have spreading feet to distribute their weight more evenly.",4
1762,"It is difficult to see how the compact feet of the sauropod could avoid becoming stuck fast in the soft, muddy bottom of a lake.",4
1763,"If the dinosaur did, after all, live on dry land, then the long neck could have usefully functioned to allow the animal to browse the high foliage of trees (p. 116).",4
1764,It has been suggested that an animal of the size of could not have breathed under water the pressure on the lungs.,4
1765,"Their fossil remains seem to occur with other animals and plants, which are generally accepted as terrestrial.",4
1766,There is even some evidence from the tracks they have left behind that and its allies moved about in herds.,4
1767,"They may have been the gigantic reptilian analogue of the elephant, and it may be no coincidence that the elephant also has its nasal openings the skull, with the nostrils in this case sited at the end of the trunk it has been suggested that some sauropods may have had a proboscis of some sort.",4
1768,The balance of evidence seems to be swinging the original idea of swamp-dwelling giant dinosaurs to fully terrestrial habits.,4
1769,But other aspects of the dinosaur living habits are still more strongly debated.,4
1770,"In the last few years a powerful controversy has arisen over whether the dinosaurs as a whole were cold-blooded, like all living reptiles (and there is no doubt that dinosaurs reptiles), or warm-blooded, resembling mammals in this respect.",4
1771,Cold-blooded animals have to ‘warm up’ before they can be fully active; that is why lizards and snakes bask in the sun in temperate climates.,4
1772,For this reason they cannot cope with climates having greatly extended winters.,4
1773,"Warm-blooded animals have the same body temperatures at all times, and can be more continuously active, but they use far more energy — and hence need more food — than cold-blooded animals of the same size.",4
1774,"The posture of many dinosaurs, and particularly the carnivorous theropod dinosaurs, was fully erect with the legs beneath the body, and unlike the sprawling legs of living reptiles (p. 116).",4
1775,"The long back legs of such hunters look highly suitable for running, and as they did so the long tail may have been held erect as a kind of counter-balance (p. 116).",4
1776,"For any kind of prolonged activity, warm-bloodedness would have been a distinct advantage.",4
1777,Under the microscope even the bone structure of these dinosaurs looks more like that of living mammals than cold-blooded reptiles.,4
1778,"On the other hand it can be argued that the sauropods like were large, and with a relatively small surface area through which to cool compared with their enormous volume, that their cooling rate could have been slow enough to allow them to sustain more continuous activity than smaller, living reptiles.",4
1779,"It has also been argued that the small mouths of the giants simply could not have downed enough food to support a warm-blooded metabolism, particularly plant food that needs a lot of processing before it becomes available as energy.",4
1780,"The armoured or plated dinosaurs include some species that seem too heavily burdened with protective armour to have been very active, but this does not necessarily mean that they had to be cold-blooded.",4
1781,Protagonists of the warm-blooded theory will show some of the horned dinosaurs charging over the Cretaceous plains like furious reptilian rhinoceroses!,4
1782,"One idea about the life habits of the dinosaur giants, published in in 1935",4
1783,The warm-blooded supporters tend to ally themselves with the supporters of a theory about the relationships of the dinosaurs.,4
1784,"This is that the dinosaurs, or a close dinosaur relative, included the ancestors of the living birds.",4
1785,"Some of the smaller, and most certainly highly active dinosaurs were about the size of a chicken, and there is more than a passing similarity between a running ostrich and the kind of reconstruction that shows fleet-footed, running dinosaurs.",4
1786,"The point is that birds themselves are warm-blooded, like mammals, and if birds and dinosaurs are as closely related as now seems likely, then it obviously increases the likelihood  that the dinosaurs themselves may have been warm-blooded.",4
1787,"The pros and cons of this theory are the subject of much contentious debate by experts, but it would probably be correct to say that the greater number of specialists believe that the more bipedal of the dinosaurs, including small and large carnivores, were warm-blooded, active animals.",4
1788,A lot of the argument among the authorities on these animals is about the equivalence or otherwise of certain bones in dinosaurs and bird skeletons (and particularly the Jurassic bird ); this makes for rather dry reading for the layman.,4
1789,"But the end-product is the accurate reconstruction of the Jurassic and Cretaceous terrestrial world, over which the dinosaurs were indisputably dominant.",4
1790,GRAPTOLITES — FLOATING COLONIES,4
1791,In the 1830s and 40s geologists were beginning to unravel the mysteries of the early Palaeozoic rocks.,4
1792,The past world recorded in the rocks could not have seemed more alien.,4
1793,"Many of the organisms that left fossil remains were of kinds now extinct, although some, like the trilobites, could obviously be placed into a phylum with many living representatives.",4
1794,"The graptolites, however, were initially completely enigmatic; they were first described as plants!",4
1795,Their remains were so abundant that they could not be ignored.,4
1796,"Their colonies, looking like so many miniature hacksaw blades, often completely covered bedding planes, and usually they were found in the absence of other kinds of fossils.",4
1797,It also became apparent that they could be useful in subdividing the intractable stretch of time from Late Cambrian to Silurian; they changed in obvious ways from one rock formation to the next.,4
1798,"Ones with numerous branches seemed to dominate the earlier rocks, ones with fewer branches were later, while in rocks we would now recognize as Silurian and early Devonian, forms with but a single branch (or ) were abundant.",4
1799,With the discovery of better-preserved material it became apparent that the graptolites consisted of rows of tiny cups which were interconnected by a common canal — they were colonial animals.,4
1800,"As noticed (p. 59) it is now known that the graptolites were an extinct branch of the phylum Hemichordata, an insignificant group today, consisting of a few encrusting colonial organisms.",4
1801,How did these mysterious organisms live?,4
1802,"In this case it is difficult to apply argument from analogy, because the graptolites  are really rather different from any animals now alive.",4
1803,The modern hemichordates are all encrusters and virtually all colonial organisms (corals or bryozoa) are bottom dwellers in the sea.,4
1804,"On this argument the graptolites should have been bottom dwelling-colonial organisms, living by filtering small particles of food from the water.",4
1805,"Some of the graptolites (dendroid graptolites) were shrubby colonies, looking very much like living hydroids or some bryozoa.",4
1806,"These were equipped with ‘roots’, and an inference of bottom-living habits seems eminently reasonable for them.",4
1807,"But the great majority of the class, including all those with typical saw-blade profiles (graptoloids) which were widely used in the dating of rocks, certainly lacked any kind of rooting structure.",4
1808,When they were looked at in more detail it was found that the colonies grew from one single tube (sicula) which is often facing in a different direction from the tubes inhabited by the rest of the colony (see below).,4
1809,A slender rod (nema) usually grows from the top of the sicula.,4
1810,"Since some of the graptoloids are large and robust, this slender rod seemed an inadequate basis for attachment to the sea floor, particularly in any sort of turbulent environment.",4
1811,"Then there were some forms, like (see p. 118), in which the colony grew over the slender nema to leave no visible means of attachment .",4
1812,"It begins to look the graptoloids could have been free-floating animals, of a kind without any living counterpart.",4
1813,"A modern reconstruction of the life habits of the giant sauropods, which could scarcely be more different from the 1935 version",4
1814,The posture of a dinosaur compared with that of a living reptile,4
1815,"The active, running posture of a dinosaur in the modern interpretation",4
1816,"Growth and budding of a graptolite colony, enlarged about 20 times",4
1817,Now the geological circumstances in which the most abundant graptolite faunas are found can be introduced into the argument.,4
1818,"The most typical occurrence of these fossils is in dark, often sooty, black shales.",4
1819,"In many localities graptolites are the only fossils to be found, but they occur in abundance.",4
1820,Sometimes they occur with cherty rocks that contain the remains of indubitably planktonic radiolaria.,4
1821,"Some, , of the graptolitic black shales are what we can recognize, with the hindsight of plate tectonic theory, as the deposits laid down of the edge of the continental shelf, in a truly oceanic environment.",4
1822,These are frequently associated with volcanic rocks of oceanic type.,4
1823,So there seems little room for doubt that the graptolites capable of living in an open-ocean environment.,4
1824,"The fact that they occur in shales without other benthic remains makes it very likely that they were free floating, and this is consistent with the way some of the species were constructed.",4
1825,Dead graptoloids simply drifted down to the bottom where they were preserved by dark muds at a depth at which there was little oxygen in the water to support bottom-dwelling organisms.,4
1826,A few examples have been found where a number of graptoloids seem to have been associated together attached (by the nema) to a ‘float’.,4
1827,Other species seem to have the nema extended into a kind of vane.,4
1828,There may have been some species which were attached to floating seaweed.,4
1829,", many graptoloids also drifted into shallower water, where they are associated with a more normal kind of fossil assemblage.",4
1830,"Like the pelagic trilobites, individual graptoloid species are very widespread, which is what one would expect of an animal with the wide ocean as its habitat.",4
1831,"It is not surprising to find that the widespread  species have been used extensively to correlate rocks between different continents — they form the standard for the Silurian period, where the graptolite faunas are nearly the same all over the world.",4
1832,", a graptolite colony with no means of attachment.",4
1833,About twice natural size.,4
1834,A sample of the different shapes achieved by the brachiopods: different shapes for differing modes of life,4
1835,In this case a combination of geological evidence and the evidence of the shape of the animal itself has been used to say something about how the animal lived.,4
1836,Many problems remain.,4
1837,Which way up did they float?,4
1838,Were there species adapted for living at particular depths?,4
1839,Why did graptoloids have an evolutionary trend from many branches to few branches?,4
1840,"There are plenty of different answers available to these questions, but, like the metabolism of dinosaurs, no concensus has been reached .",4
1841,ANIMALS WITH TWO VALVES,4
1842,"Graptolites, trilobites, and dinosaurs are all extinct, and so in the examples we have considered so far there is no direct recourse to the study of living animals to help us bring our fossils back to life.",4
1843,"Any analogies have to be with living creatures that are distantly related in the zoological sense, although there may be reasons to suspect that they have similar life habits to those that the fossil animals once enjoyed.",4
1844,"Some of the fossils with the simplest construction are those with the soft parts encased within two valves, principally the bivalves and the brachiopods.",4
1845,"These two groups of animals are quite unrelated, but both still have living representatives in the oceans, and so it is possible to look at living animals to help with the interpretation of fossil examples.",4
1846,"Of the two, the bivalve molluscs are much the most significant in the sea today.",4
1847,"The brachiopods are still numerous in some environments, but these tend to be rather inaccessible, in the deep sea, which inhibits their direct study in the field.",4
1848,"Most brachiopods lead a rather uneventful life, attached by a stalk to a hard surface, like the underside of a rock, or another shell, filtering food from the surrounding sea water.",4
1849,There is nothing to suggest that the innumerable fossil brachiopods had any other method of feeding.,4
1850,"Yet it is obvious that there are a great variety of shapes (above) among the fossil forms, many of them unmatched in living species.",4
1851,There must have been many different ways for brachiopods to exploit their simple mode of life.,4
1852,"For a filter-feeding animal, it is sensible to  separate the inhalent current, bringing food, from the exhalent one, which carries away waste products.",4
1853,"Brachiopod feeding is carried out by the (p. 61), a ciliated band usually carried on a loop, which also creates the currents used in feeding.",4
1854,"Many brachiopods have developed a broadly wavy margin of the valves (below), with the middle bent downwards.",4
1855,This form of the shell reflects the separation of the feeding currents from the exhalent currents.,4
1856,"Currents pass in through the sides of the shell, over the ciliated lophophore where the food is extracted, and then out through the depression in the margin of the valves.",4
1857,The lophophore is supported in several different ways.,4
1858,In some species the support is on a spiral made of calcium carbonate (p. 120).,4
1859,"This increases the length of the lophophore available to extract food from the feeding current, and so increases the efficiency of the process.",4
1860,Brachiopods begin to seem rather more complex animals than their simple shape suggests.,4
1861,"Many species have a finely folded margin, crumpled like corrugated cardboard.",4
1862,"Since the shell grows at the margins, a ribbed shell is produced, with fine or coarse ribs the species.",4
1863,"A ribbed shell of this kind is often stronger than one without ribs (for the same reason that corrugated iron is used for roofing), and it is probably no coincidence that ribs may be developed on bivalves too.",4
1864,But the wavy margin may serve another function.,4
1865,"For one thing it increases the of the margin, allowing the animal to admit more food per unit of length.",4
1866,"The wavy margin also prevents the entry of irritating particles of sand, with which the animal cannot cope.",4
1867,"However, there is still a problem at the crests of the corrugations, where the gap between the valves is larger; many brachiopods solve this particular problem by having fine, hair-like spines which cover the crests of the corrugations, and so prevent the intrusion of unwanted particles.",4
1868,Wavy valve margins in brachiopod.,4
1869,Note also the ribbing.,4
1870,Four times life size.,4
1871,"Although most brachiopods were attached to a firm substrate by a stalk which emerges through a hole in the pointed end of the animal, there are some in the fossil record in which there is no opening for such a stalk.",4
1872,These must have lain freely on the surface of the sediment.,4
1873,In some of these species one valve is greatly thickened.,4
1874,"This is likely to have been the lower valve, and fossils are sometimes found in ‘life position’, which confirms this.",4
1875,"The other valve sits in the thick one like a lid, and the whole animal is curved the margins of the valves were kept clear of the sediment.",4
1876,"The end result is an animal that looks very much like some kinds of oyster, although a glance at the internal feeding structures shows that they are brachiopods, unrelated to the bivalves they superficially resemble.",4
1877,"Some species had long spines (anchors?) attached to the lower, thicker valve.",4
1878,"Unlike the brachiopods, many of the modes of life of living bivalve molluscs can be more or less directly matched in fossil   examples.",4
1879,So by studying how the life habits of living bivalves are reflected in the shapes of the shells we can make deductions about how the fossils lived.,4
1880,"A major difference between brachiopods and bivalves is that the latter are capable of moving freely, using their foot to crawl or dig.",4
1881,", some bivalves, like mussels and oysters,remain fixed throughout their adult life, and it is possible that these fill the ecological role today of some of the large brachiopods of the Palaeozoic.",4
1882,Some of these lived in shallow water sites and were gregarious like mussels.,4
1883,"But since brachiopods were unable to do many of the things that bivalves do very efficiently, it would be unwise to attribute the decline of the brachiopods to diversification of the bivalves.",4
1884,Swimming in bivalves: living escaping starfish predators,4
1885,Burrowing bivalve mollusc in life position; the siphons retain contact with the surface,4
1886,"Spiral supports for the brachiopod feeding system, preserved inside one of the valves, and etched out with acid",4
1887,"Burrowing bivalves, which are typically found in the soft bottoms of shallow seas today, dig themselves down into the sediment, where they escape the attention of many predators (except birds with long bills!).",4
1888,"Many of them retain contact with the surface of the sediment long (left), which enable them to breathe and feed on small organic particles.",4
1889,"Most bivalves with siphons develop a gape at one end of the valves, they do not close  entirely in the region from which the siphons protrude.",4
1890,"It is easy to recognize such gaping valves in fossils, and there are accompanying changes on the internal structure of the shell which are associated with species with long siphons.",4
1891,Hence bivalves as old as Palaeozoic can be identified with some confidence as ancient burrowers.,4
1892,It can be confirmed by discoveries of fossils preserved in their life position.,4
1893,"Often the process of ‘digging in’ is assisted by a characteristic pattern of chevron-shaped ribs on the surface of the shell, which are also obvious features of some fossil shells.",4
1894,"Such V-shaped ribs are not found on brachiopods, which have never developed the capacity for burrowing.",4
1895,"Other kinds of bivalves have used their capacity for free movement to the utmost by becoming efficient swimmers, clapping their valves together like castanets to move through the sea to find new feeding grounds or to escape the threat of predators.",4
1896,"These bivalves have fan-like shells, often strongly ribbed ().",4
1897,"While the bottom-dwelling or burrowing bivalves mostly have a pair of strong muscles to pull the valves together, in the swimming forms the muscles have become modified there is one particularly powerful muscle, centrally placed, to produce the powerful clapping movement that propels the animal through the water.",4
1898,"This muscle leaves a conspicuous scar on the inside of the shell, an impression which is easily preserved in the fossil state.",4
1899,So it is possible to deduce swimming habits in fossil bivalves by comparison with the living forms.,4
1900,"These swimming habits go back into the Palaeozoic, to the Carboniferous or earlier.",4
1901,There are a few bivalves which are found in rocks deposited in the same sort of black shale environment that was mentioned above in the discussion of graptolite life habits.,4
1902,"Some experts maintain that these molluscs were able to swim in the open ocean, or that they were attached to floating seaweed: some such mechanism has to be invoked to explain how these bivalves came into an environment that lacked bottom-living animals.",4
1903,I have only selected a few examples of deducing modes of life from these fossils with two valves; the examples could be multiplied many times.,4
1904,"The most important point is that relatively complicated life habits can be inferred from a careful consideration of the anatomy of even the simplest looking animal, particularly when there are related, similarly adapted animals for comparison.",4
1905,PALAEONTOLOGICAL ENIGMAS,4
1906,Every now and then the fossil record throws up fossils which are palaeontological puzzles.,4
1907,"They are obviously the remains of some kind of animal, but the problem is to decide what kind.",4
1908,"They tend to be rather rare, preserved in a special way.",4
1909,"And, , like so many palaeontological matters, they stir up arguments between specialists who think they have a way of solving the enigmas.",4
1910,Some of these puzzling fossils are quite small.,4
1911,"A few years ago a minute fossil only about 2 mm long was recovered from limestones of Ordovician age, and christened .",4
1912,It looks remarkably like a trumpet.,4
1913,"The ‘mouthpiece’ and the ‘horn’of the trumpet are both open, and a coil hangs down from the middle.",4
1914,"The end of the coil is closed, and it seems reasonable to assume that the animal started growing as a coiled shell.",4
1915,"Then it must have changed its mind, and started to grow in two directions, a narrower tube into the ‘mouthpiece’ and a broader one into the ‘horn’, and there is some evidence that the ‘horn’end continued to get wider and longer.",4
1916,The problem is that it is hard to equate this kind of growth with that of any known animal group.,4
1917,"It like some kind of mollusc, but no mollusc fits easily into this pattern of growth; various people have suggested it might be some kind of snail, or perhaps a monoplacophoran (p. 76).",4
1918,It remains a puzzle.,4
1919,It is found fossils of planktonic organisms and it is possible to explain the change in growth between coil and trumpet as a change that happened when the larval shell settled on the bottom.,4
1920,"But since virtually all phyla of animals have planktonic larvae, this is no help in solving the puzzle.",4
1921,"A palaeontological enigma:, a small Ordovician fossil of unknown relationships",4
1922,Some larger fossils are even more puzzling.,4
1923,A number from the famous Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale of western Canada are so strange that they have even been claimed as the representatives of ‘extinct phyla’.,4
1924,Certainly they are difficult to accommodate comfortably in groups alive today.,4
1925,"One of these,is shown opposite.",4
1926,This curious animal has  what was probably a gut and a set of tubules arising from it; below this are curious pointed structures.,4
1927,What can it be?,4
1928,One suggestion is that early on in metazoan evolution there were a number of experimental designs which were not to give rise to direct descendants; naturally these do not fit into the pigeon holes based on living animals.,4
1929,may have been one of these.,4
1930,"There are problems with designating these as new phyla, not least that nobody can define a phylum objectively, and my own view is that, marvellous though these animals are, we should still try to relate them to other organisms (fossil and living).",4
1931,would defy all such attempts at the moment.,4

2,Susanne MacGregor and Ben Pimlott,5
3,The essays in this book do not amount to a programme: but they are intended to provide a springboard for one.,5
4,The aim is to analyse a problem which economic growth alone has failed to cure — and to consider possible new forms of public action.,5
5,"The biggest single difficulty in drawing attention to urban poverty is that it is not new, but simply — in some of its most worrying manifestations — getting worse.",5
6,"Like the poor themselves, the inner city has long been with us.",5
7,"Ever since the Industrial Revolution created a mass urban society, the conditions of the poorest city dwellers have given rise to anxiety among the better off.",5
8,"The inner city has been variously regarded as a cause for moral outrage, a threat to public order, or as a stain on the nation's conscience.",5
9,"Meanwhile bad housing, bad sanitation, lack of education, and other perennial ills associated with overcrowding and poverty have been routinely denounced by political leaders and social reformers.",5
10,"A central objective of the post-war welfare state was, indeed, to alleviate the problems of the urban poor, over whom Beveridge's Five Giants (Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor, and Idleness) had for so long held sway.",5
11,"In the early 1940s and 1950s, the belief was widely held that a combination of government intervention — in the form of town planning, housing and health programmes, and the provision of social security — and permanent male full employment, together with an increase in real wages, would reduce suffering poverty to manageable proportions.",5
12,"The 1964 Labour Government was elected on a tide of impatience at the slackening pace of social reform, but also of optimism that little more than economic growth, fuelled by technological change, was needed to remove the main causes of urban deprivation (MacGregor, 1981).",5
13,Disillusion swiftly followed.,5
14,"The work of Peter Townsend and others showed that, far from presiding over the elimination of poverty, the Wilson Government actually failed to prevent some of its features from worsening (Townsend and Bosanquet, 1972).",5
15,Evidence began to mount that much of the social welfare paternalism of the post-war period had created almost as many problems as it solved.,5
16,"Neither the Butler Education Act of 1944, nor the introduction of comprehensive schools, prevented a high proportion of children from under-achieving.",5
17,"Post-war reconstruction and housing programmes seemed to do nothing to prevent, and seemed even to encourage, a rise in crime and mental illness.",5
18,"Meanwhile, in many parts of the country, a problem as old as cities themselves — tension between cultural groups, between earlier immigrants and newer ones, between black, brown, and white, and (increasingly) between large sections of urban youth and the police — came to be identified as the key inner-city issue.",5
19,Rising unemployment turned a lingering and growing malaise into a crisis.,5
20,"As in the United States, so in Britain it was an outbreak of violence that dramatically brought the plight of the inner cities to public notice.",5
21,"In the early 1980s, at a time when manufacturing industry was collapsing and the outlook for the unskilled looked particularly bleak, frustration boiled over in a series of riots in London, Bristol, Birmingham, Liverpool, and elsewhere.",5
22,"All were spontaneous outbursts: none, some claims, were politically inspired or orchestrated (except in Northern Ireland where urban problems existed on a grander, more devastating scale, and where there was a unique heritage).",5
23,"Many had an ‘ethnic’ dimension, in the sense that many of the rioters were black.",5
24,"Unlike, however, the 1958 Notting Hill riots, few of those involved were immigrants — the vast majority were British born.",5
25,And the disturbances could not strictly be called racial: the most prominent feature was that of violent clashes between young people and the police.,5
26,"The problems, however, were not confined to violent upheavals of this kind.",5
27,"Paul Harrison's focused on Hackney, a London borough ranked among the worst off on any scale of urban deprivation  (Harrison, 1983).",5
28,"Harrison describes (p. 369) the way in which the inner urban powder-keg leads to a vicious circle, with many victims, but few individual villains:",5
29,The police force face the virtually impossible task of keeping the lid on the explosive mixture of ingredients that the dynamics of British society have assembled in the inner city.,5
30,"This mixture, heated by recession and high unemployment, inevitably generates a high level of crime.",5
31,"This necessitates, in turn, a far more numerous and ubiquitous police presence than in other kinds of area, far more frequent unpleasant contact with the public as potential suspects, and far greater opportunities for police misjudgment or abuse.",5
32,"The inevitable sufferers, , are the poor, of whom those who actually commit the offences that concern the police are a tiny minority and whom, indeed, it should be the purpose of the police to protect.",5
33,"Not only are the most disadvantaged on the receiving end of most crime, argues Harrison, they also have to put up with the heaviest police presence.",5
34,"They are more likely to be stopped and searched, and to be the victim of mistaken arrest or conviction.",5
35,"At the same time, the residents of the poorest areas have to suffer, in a way that is not true of those who live elsewhere, a growing fear of attack on themselves or their property.",5
36,"Improved police methods might help, writes Harrison, to contain the problem.",5
37,"But, without other changes, the result is likely to be a ‘society of barricaded self-defence, and a steady erosion of civil liberties’.",5
38,"And he concludes, ‘of all the warnings that the inner city has to offer for the direction British society is taking, this is perhaps the most sinister’.",5
39,"Harrison's vision of a nightmarish future for inner cities, locked in a cold or hot war between have-nots and the forces of public order, was echoed by Robert Chesshyre (1987, p. 95), who concluded that by the late 1980s:",5
40,"The basic social contract, whereby citizens enjoy certain rights — including health care, decent education and housing and a job — which they observe the rule of law, was breaking down.",5
41,"As a consequence an underclass was evolving — football hooligans, muggers, inner city rioters — somewhat more frightening than their Dickensian forebears because they were mobile and all too visible.",5
42,"Recently, , there has been an added dimension — part media-and-politician inflated, part real: drugs.",5
43,"The spiral in drug abuse and trafficking, with direct consequences for the AIDS epidemic, has created a new kind of alarm.",5
44,"The early 1980s witnessed a radical change in patterns of heroin taking, alongside the global increase.",5
45,Smoking heroin (‘chasing the dragon’) was one feature of the upsurge.,5
46,"Another was the increased availability of, and demand for, cocaine.",5
47,"Sensational media and police reports in 1989 seemed to suggest an increased use of ‘crack’ among young people in parts of south London, Liverpool, and Birmingham — with attendant fears that this particularly dangerous substance might become widespread, as it was reported to be in parts of the United States.",5
48,"for the moment, however, the pattern of drug abuse in Britain remains as varied as ever — with home-produced drugs amphetamines as serious a problem as those that hit the headlines.",5
49,"It is a symptom of public anxiety about urban squalor — and, less creditably, of class and racial prejudice — that ‘drugs’ and ‘inner cities’are automatically linked in the popular consciousness (MacGregor, 1989a).",5
50,"Nevertheless, drug-taking and more particularly the disruptive social consequences of addiction, are especially serious in areas of city poverty (Burr, 1989).",5
51,", if life was always harder in the inner cities than elsewhere, and if conditions may temporarily have been alleviated by the impact of the welfare state and rising incomes, the last decade has been widely represented as a period of deterioration.",5
52,"Moreover, few would dispute that this apparent decline is a reality: the first words of the Prime Minister herself, after the result of the 1987 election was known, were an acknowledgement of the challenge posed to Government by the ‘inner cities’.",5
53,What has been lacking however — the political will to do something — has been any shared agreement on the cause.,5
54,Can the problems of urban poverty be blamed on individual pathology?,5
55,On feckless parents and grandparents?,5
56,"Or on the social or physical environment — the replacement of companionably unhygienic slums by soulless tower blocks with broken lifts (Coleman .,",5
57,1985)?,5
58,"Or would a simple injection of resources transform Kafkaesque honeycombs into happy living-spaces, with a consequent  decline in inner-city ills?",5
59,"‘A duke can live comfortably in a castle, after all’, the architect Cedric Price is quoted as saying.",5
60,‘You and I would die of frostbite.,5
61,"Same building — just a matter of money and management’(Parkin, 1989).",5
62,The view that only ‘outstanding management’ could meet the problem was held by the Audit Commission (1987).,5
63,The picture painted by the Commission's report on inner London is as gruesome as any ever presented (and is itself revealing of common prejudices in its choice of indicators of deprivation):,5
64,"In some London boroughs, unemployment among young men exceeds 45%; in some places, among young blacks, it exceeds 60%.",5
65,one child in three is born into a single parent family.,5
66,Half the school leavers have no O levels or their CSE equivalents.,5
67,"Homelessness, housing conditions, crime are worsening year by year, as the cycle of urban deprivation becomes more established (p. 1)",5
68,"Drawing on North American experience, the Commission concluded that ‘poor management was an important contributory factor to New York's problems’, and sought to apply the same lessons here (p. 2).",5
69,"The Government's post-1987 initiatives have, to some extent, reflected a diagnosis based on the need for better management — though on the principle that central authorities can provide a firmer grip than local ones — but combined with an anti-collectivist belief in the restorative powers of capitalism.",5
70,"Leech and Amin (1988, p. 14) summarize this approach, not unfairly, in the following terms:",5
71,"the encouragement of private investment and the liberation of the market; the containment of the forces of social discontent; the control of the powers of the local authorities; and the encouragement of the movement of the wealthy into the inner city thus creating buffer areas of Tory support, accentuating inequalities and injustice and (hopefully though not necessarily) reducing the potential for conflict among the urban poor.",5
72,"The main thrust of the Government's policy is contained in the January 1988 White Paper on Regional Policy and the Enterprise Economy, in the new Employment Training programme, and especially in the March 1988 programme — all  resting on wider reforms to local government structure and finance, and to education and housing.",5
73,"The most striking feature of this package, its aim actively to involve employers and entrepreneurs, is a sharp reduction in the role of local government.",5
74,"Despite the contemporary tone of much of , the programme's heritage can be traced to the early 1960s studies which provided the basis for the 1965 Milner–Holland Report on housing and the 1967 Plowden Report on education, as a result of which general improvement areas and education priority areas were established.",5
75,"The 1970s ‘Urban Programme’ had a social, economic, emphasis and was administered by the Home Office.",5
76,"It was initiated partly the furore caused by Enoch Powell's 1969 ‘rivers of blood’ speech, much as disturbances at the 1976 Notting Hill Carnival prompted further steps the Department of the Environment —‘A riot makes a much bigger impact on government thinking’, as Donnison (1987) has pointed out, ‘than any amount of earnest and accurate research’.",5
77,"The Urban Programme consisted of grants and initiatives under the 1969 Local Government Grants (Social Need) Act, which was intended as a flexible instrument to provide supplementary help to local authorities in the fields of housing, education, and health.",5
78,"Originally, the Programme supplemented existing central and local government schemes designed to meet special needs in urban areas.",5
79,"The scope was extended in an ‘enhanced’ Urban Programme, which included economic and environmental social projects, and was specifically directed at the inner urban areas where the problems were most severe.",5
80,"Earlier, the change of emphasis from a ‘social’ to an ‘economic and environmental’focus had been reflected in a switch of responsibility for the Programme from the Home Office to the Department of the Environment.",5
81,"The ‘enhanced Programme resulted from the 1978 Inner Urban Areas Act, based on a White Paper, published the previous year, on (DoE, 1977), the first comprehensive policy statement on the subject to acknowledge it as a definable and cohesive problem.",5
82,"The White Paper drew on studies conducted earlier in the decade in Liverpool, Birmingham, and London which pointed to a debilitating flight of capital and skilled labour from the critical areas of deprivation.",5
83,A key aspect of the 1977 White Paper was the stress it placed on the wider effects of poverty: that it was not just those with acute needs who suffered.,5
84,"It argued that in talking about inner cities it was vital to think in terms not just of individuals, but of society; that the multiple deprivations of the worst hit areas affected all the residents; that the consequences included a pervasive sense of neglect and decay, a decline in community spirit, a low standard of neighbourhood facilities, and an increase in crime and vandalism; and that, without government intervention, the future was one of reduced job opportunities, deteriorating housing, and a decline in public services.",5
85,"The document, and the legislation that derived from it, pointed to a positively discriminatory approach: with both central and local government supplementing existing programmes in such a way as to strengthen local economies, the physical and social environment.",5
86,"Such measures constituted the present Government's heritage, when it took office in 1979.",5
87,"None of them, , anticipated the scale of the problems which were caused by the slump and collapse of much of what remained of inner urban manufacturing industry in the early 1980s.",5
88,"Neither, , did the incoming administration foresee the impact of rising unemployment, which was to be especially serious among the urban young.",5
89,"True, the new Secretary of State for the Environment laid stress, from the outset, on the need for economic regeneration, and indicated his sympathy for the voluntary sector in the tackling of urban problems.",5
90,"The previous Government, however, had already pointed to the need to revitalize urban economies, and the shift was more rhetorical than real.",5
91,"Michael Heseltine (1987, p. 138) has since claimed that ‘we set a new objective: to make the inner cities places where people would want to live and work and where the private investor would be willing to put his money’.",5
92,became his slogan — the partnership of public and private brains and money.,5
93,"A new Urban Development Grant was devised, to pump-prime with public funds schemes which would then attract private investment.",5
94,"Heseltine's vision was of ‘partnerships which recognise  that there are some things that only governments can pay for, but also that the ingenuity and flexibility of the private sector is indispensable’(p. 156).",5
95,"He claims that serious work on inner-city policy began in 1979: but it was, undoubtedly, the riots of 1981, coinciding with the biggest drop in employment and job vacancies since the war, which gave impetus to the new approach.",5
96,"Urban Development Corporations were introduced in 1981 in London Docklands and Merseyside, and the Urban Development Grant came in late the following year.",5
97,"Conservative instincts were, , to minimize — within the ‘partnership’— state involvement and expenditure, that of private enterprise.",5
98,"Yet, the irony of the early 1980s — as a deteriorating, but perennial, urban problem rapidly became the most acute aspect of the crisis of mass unemployment — was that a Tory government, willy-nilly, found itself presiding over an increase in state intervention through a variety of agencies.",5
99,The increased scale of operations also ushered in another fashion of the 1980s — new management structures.,5
100,Thus in 1985 City Action Teams were introduced to each ‘Inner City Partnership’ area to co-ordinate the work of the three government departments involved.,5
101,"Task forces, meanwhile, were directed to tackle youth unemployment.",5
102,"By 1986/7 the Urban Programme was supporting 1,380 starter units and 400 business starts in enterprise workshops.",5
103,"It was providing 27,500 training places (often the Manpower Services Commission): some 2,500 buildings were being improved; estate action aimed to tackle run down housing; and a large number of new ‘partnerships’(which some might see as subsidies, or discredited regional grants, in a new guise) were in operation, in an effort to bring private investment to run-down urban areas.",5
104,By 1988 it was claimed that £200 million of Urban Development Grant and Urban Regeneration Grant had successfully ‘levered’ £800 million of private investment into the inner cities (although how much of the latter sum might have been invested in any case is difficult to say).,5
105,"Meanwhile, there were other incentive schemes — Enterprise Zones, , and simplified Planning Zones, which aimed to lift tax and planning ‘barriers’ to facilitate investment.",5
106,"Indeed, while with one hand trying to hold down expenditure by  local authorities, the Government found itself by the late 1980s involved with the other hand in massive ear-marked spending on inner urban areas.",5
107,"The Department of the Environment alone by 1988 was spending half a billion pounds an Action for Cities total, involving most Home departments, estimated at £3 billion.",5
108,Perhaps a Labour government would have spent even more: it would certainly have spent it in different ways.,5
109,"It is a curious comment on Thatcherism, however, that the administration most committed to a reduction in the role of the state, and in the need for an independent private sector, has spent more on urban regeneration and employment schemes and incentives to private investment in urban areas than any other in recent history.",5
110,"One of the most bizarre aspects of government policy has been the effective murder of the voluntary sector, and its appropriation, by subterfuge, into the Tory version of the corporate state.",5
111,"Conservatives have always lauded the ‘voluntarist’ principle in welfare, and encouraged it from platforms.",5
112,"Faced, however, with the catastrophic increase in unemployment and the need to occupy large numbers of workless people without directly employing them (which would have run counter to the economic doctrine which had led to the redundancy of many of them in the first place), the Government poured money into any ‘voluntary’ agency willing to put in a bid for government-funded cheap labour.",5
113,"One result was the triumphant expansion of some charitable organizations, which rejoiced both at their new-found importance and at the Government's munificence.",5
114,"Another was the transformation of many such bodies, already heavily subsidized from public funds, into agencies of the state, which financed them and indirectly determined their policy.",5
115,"Nowhere was the impact of this clumsy sleight of hand more evident than in the inner cities, where voluntary organizations had been most active, and where the Government was most anxious for them to mop up unemployment.",5
116,"However, the later withdrawal of government support, with the scrapping of the Community Programme as unemployment receded, left many of these voluntary organizations high and dry.",5
117,"The National Council for Voluntary Organizations (NCVO) has suggested from a recent survey that  around 3,000 projects had been affected and had lost £285 million in funding (MacGregor, 1990).",5
118,"There was, , a crucial element in the Government's anxiety: the high concentration of ethnic minorities in the areas of concern.",5
119,In 1981 nearly 40 of ethnic minorities in the UK lived in ‘partnership’ or ‘programme’areas.,5
120,"There is a danger in reading back from this figure another stereotype, similar to the Pavlovian ‘drug addiction/inner city’ assumed link.",5
121,"Some urban areas have serious problems without a major ethnic dimension (Newcastle, Teesside); not all members of ethnic minorities are poor or deprived.",5
122,"Nevertheless, the high proportion of inner urban populations composed of people from ethnic minorities, and the high incidence among these groups of all the indices of poverty and social and environmental hardship — combined with the specific problem of inter-racial rivalry, harassment, and tension — make race and ethnicity an aspect that is central to any analysis of the inner cities and of any ameliorative approach.",5
123,"It was with the aim of contributing to such an improvement, as the representative body of employers and business investors, that the 1988 Confederation of British Industry (CBI) Task Force on business and urban regeneration came to three conclusions: first (the Government's own beliefs), that business must take the lead in reversing urban decline; second, that charity — governmental or voluntary — cannot in itself deal with problems, and any regeneration must spring from private investment, commercially motivated; and third, that the potential exists for such investment, early projects are seen to succeed (CBI, 1988).",5
124,"Echoing the Government, the CBI stressed the ‘partnership’ theme, involving developers and (for the CBI) local authorities.",5
125,"Leadership in such ventures, however, should come from businessmen, not local government.",5
126,"The essence of the CBI approach — as it admits, and as the Government approves — is enlightened self-interest: salvation will only come when investors want to invest, not when well-meaning local politicians and bureaucrats decide that they ought to do so.",5
127,Notably absent from the CBI's understanding of the problems of inner cities was any notion that they should be met by national economic policy.,5
128,"The assumption, rather, was one of  special, even isolated, blackspots that can be dealt with by localized attention.",5
129,"As an organization of businessmen, the CBI — naturally perhaps — looked on the inner city primarily as a business opportunity.",5
130,"Thus a special report of the CBI London Region Urban Regeneration Task Force in October 1988 concluded that there was a need for partnerships in which government, local authorities, teachers, church leaders, and residents would all play a part, but with business taking the lead — helped by government subsidy or pump-priming.",5
131,"The bottom line to private investment remains, as always, the extent and nature of government funding.",5
132,"One paradoxical consequence of central government limits to rate support grant was a real-money leap in business rates in some areas, and a sizeable increase in the proportion of local budgets paid through rates by the business community.",5
133,"This heightened business interest in local spending and revenue raising, and fermented anxiety about the operation of the uniform business rate and the community charge: the CBI, previously concerned about fluctuating rates, is now concerned about the commercial consequences of fluctuating services, as local authorities try to manage their finances.",5
134,To the CBI's worries about the future of the inner city is added a very real concern that business services may be placed high on the list for cuts by budget-chopping local authorities.,5
135,"While echoing the Government's ‘partnership’ theme in its rhetoric, and paying dutiful lip service to the principle of , the coded message of the CBI is an urgent demand for more government funding, not less.",5
136,"So far, the Government has been unreceptive.",5
137,"the Audit Commission and the CBI, Business in the Community (BIC) has taken up the theme of ‘partnership’.",5
138,"The problem, however, is turning phrases that are warmly applauded at rotary club or chamber of commerce lunches into serious investment.",5
139,Why should genuine money-makers bother?,5
140,"‘We all like to be liked’, as one Northern businessman recently put it.",5
141,"‘But, in reality…what we are doing is serving our own best interests….",5
142,The more successful the town and country is the more chance we as individuals have of being successful.’,5
143,"The trouble is, however, that the linking of individual with group  self-interest is not a sufficient incentive for smaller firms struggling to make a profit, nor indeed for large, profitable organizations.",5
144,"One of the causes of the inner-city crisis has, precisely, been the withering of the ‘Victorian value’ of civic philanthropy which once encouraged locally-based businesses to link commercial considerations with the welfare of the wider community.",5
145,"It is naïve to imagine that such an ethic can be revived by exhortation alone, or by the use of in uplifting but empty phraseology.",5
146,"It is possible, indeed, to turn the logic of the opponents of traditional regional policy and incentives, and of the proponents or a ‘partnership’ approach, on its head.",5
147,"‘Partnership’ is an acknowledgement that business will not invest without encouragement, combined with a view that long-term investment needs to be self-sustaining.",5
148,"But if the aim is to encourage serious investment, there is also a need for serious spending on infrastructure and services, is well as for start-up finance or subsidy.",5
149,"There is a need, above all, for an environment in which a fledgling (or established) business will feel comfortable and wish to remain, local amenities and the availability of a healthy, happy, well-equipped workforce.",5
150,"It is certainly arguable (and many progressive employers would agree) that the wisest use of public money from a strictly economic point of view would be on schools, houses, and medical services, together with relevant training and measures to reduce discrimination; , that the agencies which most obviously have the capacity to produce strategic planning of a business-friendly kind are precisely those which this pro-business administration wishes to bypass — central government departments, and local government, properly funded.",5
151,"That, more or less, was the conclusion reached by the 1985 report of the Archbishop of Canterbury's Commission on Urban Priority Areas,(1985), a remarkable document roundly condemned by some Conservatives for its alleged implicit Marxism.",5
152,"Focusing on economic decline, physical decay, and social disintegration as distinctive features of contemporary urban poverty, the report stressed the Commission's view — quite different from that of the Government, the Audit Commission, or even the CBI — that ‘the inner city and the peripheral estates  are creatures of the whole society, not simply of their inhabitants’(p. 24).",5
153,"It dared to question the assumption that the creation of wealth, at whatever social cost, was necessarily the first priority of an economic system.",5
154,"Contemplating ‘the displaced fragments of inner city decline’— peripheral council estates — it suggested that wealth-creation ‘must always go hand in hand with just distribution,— offering, thereby, an alternative interpretation of ‘partnership’(p. 53).",5
155,"It commented, too, on the environmental and ecological consequences.",5
156,"For the Archbishop's commissioners, partnership needed to mean not just a link-up between business and the public or voluntary sectors, but a conscious attempt to meet the powerlessness felt by the ‘people in the street’(p. 186).",5
157,"The Archbishop's investigators did not search for, or embrace, a fashionable solution.",5
158,On the contrary.,5
159,"Their main call was for a return to the 1977 White Paper, namely: ‘a specific commitment central and local government to the regeneration of the inner areas…both central and local government will be judged by their willingness to implement new priorities, to make funds available, to change policies and to adapt their organisations,(DoE, 1977, para. 25).",5
160,concluded bluntly that the 1977 White Paper's ‘policy proposals have not been tried and found wanting.,5
161,"They have not been tried’(Archbishop of Canterbury's Commission, 1985, p. 193).",5
162,"So far from treating the problems of the inner city as local difficulties which a bit of capitalist enterprise could clear up, it regarded them as evidence of systemic failure.",5
163,"The retreat from the principles of the 1977 White Paper occurred in the context of the economic crisis of the 1970s, which culminated in the 1976 resort to the International Monetary fund.",5
164,"The scale of expenditure on all aspects of local government, and the greatly increased proportion of total public expenditure which it represented, meant that, when the crisis came, some were led to blame local authorities, and in the cuts that followed inner cities inevitably suffered most acutely.",5
165,"A serious blow, , was also dealt to the reputation of the Labour Party, which controlled many of the councils with the greatest needs and which made the heaviest demands on the public purse, and whose members were least apologetic about  doing so.",5
166,"When Anthony Crosland declared that the ‘party is over, he cannot have realized that the Government's cuts presaged a long period in which the Labour Party itself would be seriously threatened — partly its association with supposedly spendthrift urban policies.",5
167,In the early and mid-1980s a handful of ‘municipal socialist’ Labour councils (triumphantly declared ‘loony’by Norman Tebbit and the right-wing press) were used as a symbol of the party's alleged financial irresponsibility.,5
168,"With Labour welfarism fashion, and neo-liberalism in vogue, the scene was set, not only for the downgrading of local authority power (including the outright abolition of the Greater London Council and the metropolitan authorities which, though actually limited in their spending power, were nevertheless the coordinators and vocal champions of many inner urban schemes), but also for the injection of national party dogma into the management of local affairs.",5
169,"‘This Government is a radical government with a radical message…’, wrote Secretary of State Nicholas Ridley (1988, p. 32).",5
170,"‘Conservatives have a strong localist tradition, but the danger of too much localism is that the Party's voice and through the Party the political interpretation of the Government's voice is not heard.’",5
171,"This was one ‘problem’, , which the present administration has proved highly successful at solving.",5
172,"So dramatic, indeed, has been the impact of privatization and contracting services, and of other local government changes, that a reduction of over a third in the total number of local authority employees over the next five years has been predicted by one senior official (Davies, 1988).",5
173,"It remains to be seen whether the restructuring will save money, or merely shift essential expenditure between agencies, or simply reduce available services.",5
174,"What it will not do, , is tackle the inner-city problem — nor indeed is it designed to do so.",5
175,"If there ever was a Thatcherite economic miracle, it has, to an alarmingly divisive degree, passed the urban poor by.",5
176,"Jobless growth, changes in the composition of the workforce, increased ‘flexibility’ of labour's terms and conditions, have all contributed to an economic revival which has had minimal benefits where these are needed most.",5
177,"‘The effect has been to  reinforce the concentration of unemployment in traditional inner city areas’, the Centre for Local Economic Strategies (CLES) reported in (1988), ‘and in the regions which were already suffering the worst unemployment before 1979.’",5
178,"Yet the critical question for the 1990s and the twenty-first century remains unanswered: is there an approach — through central government intervention, decentralization, the encouragement of participation, or any other method — which avoids the insensitivities of bureaucratic welfarism, and yet produces results?",5
179,PROGRAMME FOR THE 1990s,5
180,Responding to this question — by asking new questions as much as by offering solutions — is the purpose of this book.,5
181,"It is, indeed, easier to point out the irrelevance of much of what is happening at the moment than to have confidence in any particular alternative.",5
182,"Still, some things may be said with reasonable assurance.",5
183,"Almost everyone agrees, , that enterprise zones alone are of limited value, that tax incentives are relatively ineffective and deregulation is no solution.",5
184,"Despite government rhetoric, the impact of such measures on people places — as several authors in this volume show — has been marginal.",5
185,Contributors also agree on another point: that public expenditure and public services based on principles of universalism and citizenship for all are central to any real programme.,5
186,The chapters in this book deliberately provide a balance between experts with direct political or administrative experience of the areas they describe (Nick Raynsford and David Mallen) and academic observers.,5
187,Several contributors have both political/ administrative and academic credentials.,5
188,The original intention was to provide a critical accompaniment to government promises of action on the inner cities made at the beginning of this Parliament.,5
189,"them, however, has emerged the kernel of a view of the future.",5
190,"If there is a consistent bias public intervention and against inertia, there is also, we hope, little shirking of awkward issues — though the collection does not claim to be  comprehensive, and there are aspects of a huge topic that are barely touched.",5
191,"What the book does attempt to do is to provide a framework of problems and ideas, exploring major themes.",5
192,"Some chapters look at the manifestations of urban breakdown-John Benyon and John Solomos writing about racial conflict and disorder, — others, like Robert Reiner, at the evidence on rising crime rates and the complex ethical dilemmas which are often presented as simple.",5
193,"Several contributors are concerned with how urban dwellers actually live their lives: Peter Townsend, , shows the impact of social polarization upon health and well-being by indicating differential rates of mortality and morbidity, and the widening gap between the experiences of rich and poor.",5
194,Others look at local government and central-local relations in practice.,5
195,"Susanne MacGregor points to the impact of a growing climate of social Conservatism, a climate that is encouraged by aspects of government policy.",5
196,"John Gibson highlights the regressive aspects of recent local government financial reform, and predicts dire consequences for the urban poor.",5
197,The chances of the new system of local government finance surviving seem slim.,5
198,"Particular services are examined by two writers closely involved with implementation: Nick Raynsford looks it recent developments in policies on housing, and David Mallen considers how education might effectively be used as a key instrument of social improvement.",5
199,Hilary Land examines women's systematic loss of rights and claims for social protection and its effect on the family and children during the 1980s.,5
200,She demonstrates that policies of amelioration will do in more than touch the surface unless fundamental gender inequalities are addressed.,5
201,"A consistent underlying theme is that a reliance on market forces cannot be the answer: in every area, public action is urgently needed.",5
202,"Alternative approaches are reviewed by Franco Bianchini, who points to the potential role of an adequately funded arts programme in fostering civic pride and countering alienation, and Doreen Massey who emphasized the need for a combination of progressive national and local economic strategies.",5
203,She turns the Government's self-help approach around by arguing that urban recovery will only be achieved by empowering the people who live in cities.,5
204,"Her final essay, indeed, echoes the theme of the whole book: the focus must be on democracy and on a sensitivity to local and individual needs and aspirations.",5
205,"In the early post-war period, the British welfare state was thought to be the envy of much of the industrialized world.",5
206,"Today, it is a cause for embarrassment, especially in the context of moves towards European integration.",5
207,One reason is relative economic decline.,5
208,"Another is the failure of vision of successive governments, Labour and Conservative, since 1951.",5
209,"A third, since 1979, has been a conscious (and accelerating) ambition to limit public provision.",5
210,"To a large extent, however, fashionable doctrine has been the excuse for actual incompetence and neglect.",5
211,"There has been a consistent failure to direct the fruits of growth to the areas, industries, and groups that need it most.",5
212,"Outside London and the South-East, mass unemployment persists even among ‘prime-age males’, and much of the increase in employment has taken the form of low-paid, so-called ‘part-time’ work usually undertaken by women their child-rearing and ‘community care’activities.",5
213,"Contempt for the public sector has led to a deterioration of the infrastructure, and a visible collapse of key public services.",5
214,"Meanwhile, as Layard and Nickell (1989) have shown, Britain's recent record on education and training has been notably inadequate.",5
215,The pragmatic short-term remedies suggested by W. J. Wilson (1987) in his study of inner cities and public policy in the United States could serve as one starting-point for discussion of policy in Britain.,5
216,Wilson warns of the long-term effects of discriminatory policies.,5
217,"‘Long periods of racial oppression’, he writes, ‘can result in a system of inequality that may persist for indefinite periods of time even after racial barriers are removed’(p. 146).",5
218,"Bad policies in the past may continue to cause problems, long after they have been replaced by good ones.",5
219,Similar problems follow from centuries of unequal treatment of men and women.,5
220,"Conversely, positive policies should not be abandoned because they do not show immediate miraculous results.",5
221,"What the Right regards as  wasteful —‘throwing money at the problem’— , , income support to the unwaged, non-means-tested family and child benefits, may actually be a prudent investment in the future, with social and economic dividends.",5
222,Wilson's conclusion — universal programmes — is one that needs to be reasserted for many areas of policy in Britain.,5
223,"Here, too, Richard Titmuss's exposure of the inadequacies of the ‘residual’ model of the welfare state bears re-examination: so does his healthy disrespect for econometric models as a foundation for social policy.",5
224,It is not just that a ‘market’ approach to the administration of services dehumanizes people and makes doubtful assumptions about the way organizations actually work.,5
225,"It also ignores the complexity and variability of social relations and human needs, ‘chopping people up’ into consumers of this, clients of that, institutionalized service.",5
226,"Thus, Titmuss ridiculed the contortions of some economists in trying to base models on unreal statistical categories, that of the ubiquitous ‘average family’(Abel-Smith and Titmuss, 1987, p. 9).",5
227,"their claims, ‘targeted’ programmes frequently miss some of their most needy would-be clients, and stigmatize those they do succeed in reaching: selectivist policies deepen social divisions heal them.",5
228,"Such programmes treat people as consumers in a supermarket, an approach which is the hallmark of Thatcherite social policy best epitomized in their poll tax legislation.",5
229,"Another, more fundamental lack is the absence of a view of the recipients of services as social participants.",5
230,An obsession with cutting costs and with theories of self-help has downgraded public services and re-evoked images of the poor law.,5
231,There is no simple way to turn local administration — which increasingly means delegated central administration — into what John Stewart and Gerry Stoker (1988) call ‘community government’.,5
232,"Participation is an easier word to use than to implement, as was discovered by the would-be implementers of the 1969 Skeffington Report, and by many idealistic councillors in the 1980s.",5
233,"But to say that it is hard does not make it less desirable, neither does it mean that governments should abandon the attempt.",5
234,"What is clear is that civic or community pride — essential  if urban decline is not to turn into urban collapse — and the view of local government as an honourable profession, cannot survive unless the public service which local authorities provide rests on principles of local democracy.",5
235,Simply handing over powers to local government (or stopping the removal of them) is not enough.,5
236,But it is the of progress towards a more sensitive management of urban affairs.,5
237,Decentralization and local democracy should be the slogans of all who are concerned about the inner city.,5
238,CONCLUSION,5
239,"The essays in this book do not present a monolithic view, and they reflect widely differing perspectives.",5
240,"However, they share common perceptions, as we have already indicated.",5
241,"Though they are neither statist nor paternalist, the authors see a larger role for democratic central and local government in the reduction of urban poverty.",5
242,"They do not — as this administration, despite its early assurances, appears to do — regard urban life as marginal to the issue of economic progress.",5
243,"On the contrary, they place the crisis in the inner cities at the centre of any national programme — of critical importance to this country's future social, economic, and constitutional well-being.",5
244,"They see urban decay not as a peripheral manifestation nor as a growing pain, but as a chronic condition of social polarization that is becoming firmly entrenched in British society.",5
245,"The authors are unconvinced that a reliance on business, left to its own devices or even pump-primed, is sufficient, without full-scale and direct attention to the needs of all residents, those in both the paid and the unpaid workforce, and their dependants.",5
246,"In the ancient world, during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, even in the twentieth century, the word ‘city’ was frequently associated with wealth, success, culture, and opportunity.",5
247,The word ‘civilization’ itself — and the word ‘citizen’— derives from it.,5
248,"It is a bitter indictment of our own time that the phrase ‘inner city’ should today universally conjure up images of disorder, poverty, fear, vandalism, and alienation.",5
249,"If capitalism can be credited with historic levels of prosperity for many, the inner city  is the cockroach at its heart.",5
250,"Homelessness, drug addiction, beggars in the streets give the lie to the assumption that the standardized values and comforts of the suburbs are universally available.",5
251,This book does not pretend to offer an answer.,5
252,"Its authors seek, rather, by challenging old approaches and re-analysing the problem, both to assert its importance and to suggest new ways of tackling it.",5

255,INTRODUCTION,5
256,Civil disorder and unrest were recurring phenomena in many British inner-city areas during the 1980s.,5
257,"In 1980, 1981, and 1985 major riots in Bristol, London, Liverpool, and Birmingham commanded the headlines and became a key theme in policy debates about the future of the inner cities.",5
258,"It is worth stressing that in year since 1980 there have been examples of serious street disorder (Benyon, 1984; Benyon and Solomos, 1987).",5
259,These outbreaks of disorder have presented a major challenge to the Thatcher Government's image as the guardian of public order.,5
260,"More importantly, however, they have given added urgency to the long-running debate about the future of Britain's inner cities.",5
261,"The sight of violent confrontations on the streets of major cities helped to stimulate yet further the acrimonious political debate about how to regenerate depressed inner-city localities (Robson, 1988).",5
262,"This chapter explores the political and policy debates surrounding the major outbreaks of urban unrest during 1980–1 and 1985, and the ever-present threat of more violent disorder.",5
263,"After providing a brief overview of the chronology of urban unrest during the 1980s, the chapter concentrates on two main themes.",5
264,"First, the political debates about the origins and causes of the unrest are assessed, and second, the impact of the unrest on the policy agenda is examined.",5
265,"This entails a review of the impact of the Scarman Report, and other important policy documents, on the agenda of both the Government and other political institutions.",5
266,"Finally, the chapter concludes by providing some reflections about the prospects during the decade ahead.",5
267,THE CONTEXT OF URBAN UNREST: 1981 AND 1985,5
268,The first notable instance of urban unrest during the 1980s took place in the St Paul's district of Bristol on 2 April 1980.,5
269,"The immediate reaction to this event was one of shock and surprise, with public and media attention focusing particularly on the interplay between racial and social deprivation in the St Paul's area (Joshua and Wallace, 1983).",5
270,"A year later further serious violence occurred during the weekend of 10–12 April 1981 in the Brixton area of south London; this resulted in many injuries and widespread damage, and it attracted enormous media attention.",5
271,Further disturbances took place in many parts of the country in July 1981.,5
272,"On Friday, 3 July a pitched battle occurred in Southall between hundreds of skinheads and local Asian people, and the police quickly became embroiled.",5
273,"On the same night in the Liverpool 8 district of Merseyside, an apparently minor incident sparked off rioting which lasted until Monday, 6 July.",5
274,The disorder in Liverpool 8 was particularly violent.,5
275,"For the first time ever in Britain, CS gas was fired at rioters by the police.",5
276,"Looting and arson were widespread, and the damage was estimated at some £10 million.",5
277,"On the night of 7–8 July 1981, disorder occurred in Moss Side, Manchester.",5
278,"During the following week disturbances were reported in places Handsworth in Birmingham, Sheffield, Nottingham, Hull, Slough, Leeds, Bradford, Leicester, Derby, High Wycombe, and Cirencester.",5
279,Disorder again erupted in Brixton on 15 July 1981.,5
280,"At 2.00 a.m. eleven houses in Railton Road were raided by 176 police-officers, with a further 391 held in reserve.",5
281,"The police had warrants to look for evidence of unlawful drinking and to search five houses for petrol bombs, although no evidence of either was found.",5
282,"During the operation the houses sustained very considerable damage — windows, sinks, toilets, floorboards, furniture, televisions, and personal possessions were smashed.",5
283,The resultant outcry led to an internal inquiry which exonerated those involved and stated that the police officers had been issued with sledgehammers and crowbars ‘to effect speedy entry’.,5
284,"Compensation of £8,500 for structural damage, and further sums for damage to personal property, were paid by the Metropolitan Police.",5
285,"This  raid, and the resultant violence on the streets of Brixton, convinced many people that the way policing is carried out is a vital factor in the context of urban unrest.",5
286,"An inquiry into the Railton Road raid by the Police Complaints Board discovered ‘serious lapses from professional standards’ and an ‘institutional disregard for the niceties of the law’(Benyon and Solomos, 1987).",5
287,"Disorder was again evident in 1982 and in subsequent years, although on a reduced scale (Benyon and Solomos, 1987).",5
288,"The attention of the news media was firmly focused on the Falklands, and so few accounts of disturbances in British cities were reported.",5
289,"It is clear, though, that urban unrest continued to occur in parts of London and Liverpool, and similar disorder seems to have taken place in 1983.",5
290,"The following year, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner reported that during 1984 there were many mini-riots which had the potential to escalate to Brixton 1981 proportions, and he added: ‘London is nowadays a very volatile city.’",5
291,"A MORI opinion poll in February 1985 reported that 64 of those surveyed expected further riots to occur in British cities, and seven months later their fears were justified.",5
292,In September and October 1985 serious urban unrest again became the focus of popular attention.,5
293,"The first major eruption occurred on Monday, 9 September 1985 in the Lozells Road area of Handsworth, Birmingham.",5
294,"The riot resulted in the deaths of two Asian men, Kassamali and Amirali Moledina, who suffered asphyxiation in their burning post office.",5
295,"Another 122 people, mainly police, were reported injured and the value of damaged property was put at £7.5 million.",5
296,"Further rioting occurred the next day when Douglas Hurd, the Home Secretary, visited the area.",5
297,"Other disturbances, widely regarded as ‘copycat’, were reported elsewhere in the West Midlands, in Moseley, Wolverhampton, and Coventry, and in the St Paul's district of Bristol.",5
298,"The Handsworth/Soho/Lozells area, with a population of 56,300, is regarded by Birmingham City Council as the most deprived district in the city.",5
299,"Unemployment is a major affliction, and at the time of the riots 36 of the workforce in Handsworth was work, while the figure for people under 24 years was 50 .",5
300,"It is an area in which it was claimed that  reasonably good relations existed between young blacks and the police, as a result of the practice of community policing introduced in the late 1970s.",5
301,"However, at the end of 1981 a new superintendent instituted changes which included moving a number of the area's community police-officers to other duties and clamping down on the activities by local youths which had previously been tolerated.",5
302,These changes resulted in an increase in tension between youths and the police.,5
303,"In July 1985 two serious disturbances occurred in Handsworth, but both were played down and went unreported in the media.",5
304,"The context within which the eruption on 9 September occurred was thus one of deteriorating relations between young people, especially blacks, and the police, one of widespread unemployment and social disadvantage.",5
305,"The tinder merely required a spark, which was provided when a black youth became involved in an altercation with an officer over a parking ticket.",5
306,"It was alleged that during the incident, at which more police arrived, a black woman was assaulted.",5
307,Three hours later some forty-five buildings in Lozells Road were ablaze.,5
308,"Brixton was the scene of the next outbreak of violent disorder, during the weekend 28–9 September 1985. 724 major crimes were reported, 43 members of the public and 10 police-officers were injured, and 230 arrests were made.",5
309,"As in Handsworth, the event which led to the rioting involved police-officers and a black person.",5
310,"At 7.00 a.m. on 28 September armed police entered Mrs Cherry Groce's house in Normandy Road, Brixton, looking for her son.",5
311,"Two shots were fired by an officer, and a bullet damaged Mrs Groce's spine causing permanent paralysis.",5
312,"At 6.00 p.m. the local police station was attacked with petrol bombs, and during the next eight hours large numbers of people, both black and white, took part in burning and looting which caused damage estimated at £3 million.",5
313,During the riot a freelance photographer sustained injuries from which he died three weeks later.,5
314,"Two days after Mrs Groce was shot, rioting occurred in Toxteth (Liverpool 8).",5
315,"In this instance, the disturbances were precipitated when four black men were refused bail at Liverpool Magistrates' Court.",5
316,"During the summer there had been reports of rising tension in the area, and on 30 August a crowd demonstrated outside Toxteth Police Station and then attacked police  cars and the station itself.",5
317,A number of assaults on police-officers were also reported.,5
318,"As in Brixton and Handsworth, police relations with youths, and especially with young black people, were a significant factor in the explosive mixture, and in Toxteth, too, the disorder was precipitated by an incident involving police officers and black people.",5
319,"The most serious of the disorders occurred at the Broadwater Farm Estate, in Tottenham, London.",5
320,"The rioting began about 7.00 p. m. on Sunday, 6 October 1985, and during a night of extraordinary violence Police Constable Keith Blakelock was stabbed to death, 20 members of the public and 223 police-officers were injured, and 47 cars and some buildings were burned.",5
321,"Guns were fired at the police, causing injuries to several officers and reporters, and the forces were issued with CS gas and plastic bullets, although these were not used.",5
322,"As in Handsworth, Brixton, and Toxteth, the context within which the disturbances occurred in Tottenham was one of deteriorating relations between the police and young people, especially blacks, and the trigger event involved police-officers and black people (Gifford, 1986).",5
323,"The chief superintendent for the area was a firm believer in community policing, and he put as his first priority the prevention of public disorder.",5
324,"However, it is clear that many of his police constables and sergeants did not agree with this approach.",5
325,"During the summer of 1985 there was evidence of increasing tension, and a prominent member of the Hornsey Police Federation was quoted as saying that rank and file officers ‘desperately wanted to go in hard and sort out the criminals’.",5
326,"Some serious incidents occurred during this period on the Broadwater Farm Estate, an attack on police by youths which resulted in one officer sustaining a bad head wound, and there was also a series of attacks on an Asian-owned supermarket.",5
327,"Senior police-officers appeared to play these incidents down, but black youths complained that on the estate they were increasingly harassed by the police.",5
328,"The incident which precipitated the riot began when police-officers stopped a car driven by Floyd Jarrett, a 23-year-old black man well known in the area.",5
329,"One of the officers decided to arrest Jarrett for suspected theft of the car, but after an altercation Jarrett  was in fact charged with assaulting a police-officer.",5
330,"On 13 December 1985 Jarrett was acquitted of this charge, and was awarded £350 costs against the police.",5
331,While he was detained at the police station a number of police-officers used a key taken from the arrested man to enter his mother's home.,5
332,During the police search of the house Mrs Cynthia Jarrett collapsed.,5
333,The family alleged that her death was caused by a police-officer who pushed her over; the police denied that this had occurred.,5
334,On 4 December 1985 the inquest returned a verdict of accidental death.,5
335,"Mrs Jarrett was certified dead at 6.35 p.m. on Saturday, 5 October, and news of the tragedy spread quickly around the estate during the evening.",5
336,"The next day, after sporadic incidents, violent disorder erupted at about 7.00 p. m.",5
337,Disorder occurred again in 1986.,5
338,During the spring there were renewed reports of increasing tension in some areas.,5
339,"In Notting Hill, , there were allegations of assaults by the police, and the planting of drugs, while in Nottingham a number of forced entries into black people's homes and a series of street searches caused widespread anger.",5
340,On the Broadwater Farm Estate virtually every black male under 30 was interrogated — over 350 people were arrested although most were released without charge.,5
341,"In July 1986 the Metropolitan Police mounted a huge raid in Brixton, involving nearly 2,000 officers, aimed at selected premises in which cannabis offences were allegedly being committed.",5
342,In early September 1986 serious disorder occurred on the streets of the North Prospect Estate in the Devonport constituency of Plymouth.,5
343,"A large crowd of white youths set up burning barricades and smashed windows, doors, and fences on the estate.",5
344,A few days later the Avon and Somerset Police organized a large raid in the St Paul's district of Bristol.,5
345,"Almost exactly one year after the Handsworth riots, 600 police moved into the area to search several premises drugs and drinking offences.",5
346,"The reaction was serious rioting and attacks on the police involving petrol bombs, bricks, and stones.",5
347,In 1987 disorder occurred in Wolverhampton after a black youth died of asphyxiation while being arrested on 20 February.,5
348,"Later in the year, violent clashes occurred on the streets of ",5
349,MAKING SENSE OF THE 1981 RIOTS,5
350,Reactions to the riots have concentrated on a number of key variables that are said to characterize the localities in which the riots have occurred.,5
351,"Lord Scarman's report on the 1981 disorders highlighted the importance of unemployment, urban deprivation, racial disadvantage, relations between young blacks and the police, the decline of civic consent, and political exclusion as the key issues.",5
352,Other reactions have concentrated on the issue of the interplay between inner-city decay and racial disadvantage in contemporary Britain.,5
353,"Yet others have argued that the unrest can be seen as a symptom of the breakdown of law and order in British society (Gaffney, 1987; Hall, 1987; Keith, 1987).",5
354,The main issues that were prominent in debates during 1980–1 were ‘race’ and ‘law and order’.,5
355,"This was an accident, since throughout the 1970s a powerful body of media, political, and academic opinion had been constructed around the theme of how Britain was drifting into a ‘violent society’, and how the basis of consent was being shifted by the pressures of immigration and the growth of multi-racial inner city areas.",5
356,A glimpse of the impact of the 1980–1 riots at this level can be achieved through two important debates in Parliament.,5
357,"The first took place in the midst of the July 1981 riots, and had as its theme: ‘Civil Disturbances’.",5
358,"The tone of the debate was set by Home Secretary William Whitelaw's introductory statement in which he spoke of (a) the need to ‘remove the scourge of criminal violence from our streets’, and (b) the urgency of developing ‘policies designed to promote the mutual tolerance and understanding upon which the whole future of a free democratic society depends’(, vol. 8, 16 July 1981: col. 1405).",5
359,"The ‘scourge of criminal violence’ was, Whitelaw argued, a danger to the whole framework of consent and legality on which the  political institutions of British society were based.",5
360,"In reply Roy Hattersley supported the call for the immediate suppression of street violence, but warned that the roots of such riots could not be dealt with until all people felt they had a stake in British society (ibid.: cols. 1407–9)",5
361,"The second debate took place on 26 November 1981, on the publication of the Scarman Report, and had as its theme: ‘Law and Order’.",5
362,"The importance of the riots in pushing the law and order issue, and specifically policing, the main political agenda was emphasized by the Liberal leader, David Steel, who argued that ‘urgent action’ to prevent a drift into lawlessness was necessary from both a moral and a political perspective (, vol. 13, 26 November 1981: cols. 1009–11).",5
363,"A subsequent debate on the same issue in March 1982 was also full of references to the experience of 1981, the impact of street violence, crime, decaying urban conditions, the breakdown of consent between the police and many local communities, and the spectre of ‘more violence to come’ if changes in both policing tactics and social policy were not swiftly introduced (, vol. 20, 25 March 1982: cols. 1107–81).",5
364,"The need to support the police was accepted by both the Labour and the Conservative speakers in the parliamentary debate on the riots, and was established as a benchmark for the official response to the riots long before the Scarman Report was published in November 1981.",5
365,Any substantive disagreement centred around the issue of what role social deprivation and unemployment had in bringing young people to protest violently on the streets.,5
366,"Intermingled with the discourses about race and law and order were constant references to unemployment, particularly among the young, and various forms of social disadvantage and poverty (Solomos, 1988, pp. 186–911).",5
367,"Throughout 1980 and 1981 debates about the riots in the media, in Parliament, and in various official reports hinged around the interrelationship between racial, law-and-order, and social factors.",5
368,"The importance of this debate can be explained, partly, by the political capital which the Opposition could make from linking the social and economic malaise of the country with violent street disturbances.",5
369,"Conversely, throughout this period Government Ministers strenuously denied  that unemployment and social deprivation were significant causes of urban unrest.",5
370,"Although the Scarman Report is often taken to be the central text which argues for a link between ‘social conditions’ and ‘disorder’, the terms of the debate were set by Scarman.",5
371,During both April and July 1981 vigorous exchanges took place in the press and in Parliament about the role that deteriorating social conditions and unemployment may have played in bringing about the riots.,5
372,"During the 16 July parliamentary debate on ‘Civil Disturbances’, Roy Hattersley's formulation of this linkage provided a useful summary of the ‘social conditions’ argument.",5
373,"After some preliminary remarks about the Labour party's support for the police, he went on to outline his opposition to the view of the riots as essentially anti-police outbursts:",5
374,I repeat that I do not believe that the principal cause of last week's riots was the conduct of the police.,5
375,"It was the conditions of deprivation and despair in the decaying areas of our old cities — areas in which the Brixton and Toxteth riots took place, and areas from which the skinhead invaders of Southall come.",5
376,"(, vol. 8, 16 July 1981: col. 1408)",5
377,Much of the subsequent controversy about this analysis centred on the question of youth unemployment.,5
378,"Hattersley had suggested that the riots were a ‘direct product’ of high levels of youth unemployment, and a furious debate ensued in both Parliament and the media about this assertion.",5
379,"The final symbolic cue used to make sense of the 1980–1 protests is more difficult to categorize, but its basic meaning can be captured by the term ‘political marginality’.",5
380,"While a number of discussions of the roots of urban unrest in the United States have noted the salience of political marginality in determining participation in violent protests (Skolnick, 1969; Fogelson, 1971; Edelman, 1971; Knopf, 1975), this issue has received relatively little attention in Britain.",5
381,"Nevertheless, during the 1980–1 events and their aftermath the political context was discussed from a number of perspectives.",5
382,"The Scarman Report, , located part of the explanation for the riots in the feelings of alienation and powerlessness  which were experienced by young blacks living in depressed inner-city areas.",5
383,"A successful policy for tackling the roots of urban disorder was seen as one which sought to involve all the community in dealing with the problems of each area they could come to feel that they have a stake in its future (Scarman, 1981, para. 6.42).",5
384,"Where such arguments did not fit in with the overarching themes of race, violence and disorder, and social deprivation they were either sidelined or pushed into the sub-clauses of official reports.",5
385,"The Scarman Report, , contained the following policy proposal: ‘I recommend that local communities must be fully and effectively involved in planning, in the provision of local services, and in the management and financing of specific projects,(Scarman, 1981, para. 8.44).",5
386,Such a move towards greater political integration was seen by Lord Scarman as essential if the gap between inner-city residents and the forces of law and order was to be bridged.,5
387,"But the concern with overcoming political marginality remained on the sidelines of the main public debate because it questioned the perception of the rioters as driven by irrational, uncivilized, and criminal instincts.",5
388,"This did not, however, stop the question of political marginality and the need to reform existing policies from being raised , as can be seen subsequently by the attempts after 1981 to introduce both locally and nationally measures which were meant to address some of the grievances of the rioters and to ensure that further disturbances did not occur.",5
389,Aspects of these measures are considered further on in the chapter.,5
390,PERSPECTIVES ON THE 1985 RIOTS,5
391,"Despite widespread predictions of further unrest in the aftermath of 1981, the scale and the location of the 1985 riots seem to have surprised even some of the most astute commentators.",5
392,"Handsworth, , was presented even shortly before September 1985 as a ‘success story’ police — community relations.",5
393,The outbreak of violence in this area was therefore widely presented as an aberration.,5
394,"Similarly the spread of violence in London to areas the Broadwater Farm Estate in Tottenham  was seen as a break from previous experience, which had centred on areas Brixton.",5
395,There are many continuities between 1980–1 and 1985 the common-sense images used in the press and television to cover the events.,5
396,"But responses in 1985 were different, degree, and probably the extent to which the riots were seen as a ‘race’ phenomenon by a wider body of opinion.",5
397,The ambiguities and sub-clauses to be found in much of the press coverage during 1980–1 had acted as a countervailing tendency against the more extreme forms of discourse which blamed the riots completely on black people.,5
398,"During the 1985 riots and their immediate aftermath, the imagery of ‘race’ was used by sections of the press without the sense of ambiguity which could still be found in 1980–1.",5
399,"The ‘silence over race’ was breached in 1980–1, but in 1985 debate about racial issues was taken a step further.",5
400,"Peregrine Worsthorne, , used the ferocity of the confrontations in Handsworth, Brixton, and Tottenham to argue that there was a major question mark over the possibility of assimilating the ‘coloured population’ into mainstream ‘British values’(Sunday Telegraph, 29 September 1985).",5
401,"To be sure there was still a strong response opposing Enoch Powell's call for repatriation, from all shades of political opinion, but the racialization of public debate about the 1985 riots went much further than 1980–1.",5
402,In this context it was the externality of British Afro-Caribbeans and Asians which was highlighted rather the racist institutions and processes which worked against blacks at all levels of society.,5
403,"The usage of ‘race’ during the September-October 1985 period took on new meanings, which had little if anything to do with the impact of racism as such, since the emphasis was on the cultural characteristics of the minority communities themselves.",5
404,"After Handsworth part of the press response was to blame the riot on rivalry between West Indians and Asians, and even after the arguments were criticized by local residents; and community leaders, they were used to ‘explain’'what happened.",5
405,", the question whether the cultures and values of the black communities, their family structures, and their political attitudes ‘bred violence’ was constantly raised (van Dijk, 1988).",5
406,"The actual facts' of who was arrested during the riots, whether black or white, were hardly debated since it was assumed that they were mostly black and mostly unemployed and involved with crime (Keith, 1987).",5
407,"The imagery of the ‘black bomber, used in Handsworth was extended to the notion that there were groups of alienated and criminalized young blacks who saw the riots as a chance to engage in an ‘orgy of looting’.",5
408,The Dear Report on Handsworth captures this image and links it to the social condition of young blacks:,5
409,"The majority of rioters who took part in these unhappy events were young, black and Afro-Caribbean origin.",5
410,"Let there be , these young criminals are not in any way representative of the vast majority of the Afro-Caribbean community whose life has contributed to the life and culture of the West Midlands over many years and whose hopes and aspirations are at one with those of every other law-abiding citizen.",5
411,We share a common sorrow.,5
412,It is the duty of us all to ensure that an entire cultural group is not tainted by the actions of a criminal minority.,5
413,"(Dear, 1985, p. 69)",5
414,"This ‘black’ criminal minority was constructed not only into the leading force behind the riots, but sometimes as the force.",5
415,"Indeed, throughout September and October 1985, and during the following months, the imagery of race continued to dominate debate about both the causes and the policy outcomes of the riots.",5
416,"As pointed out earlier, the ‘social causes’ argument was another major plank of public debate about the 1980–1 riots, particularly the highly politicized issue of unemployment.",5
417,"During 1985 this issue was raised , though by then the extent of mass unemployment and urban de-industrialization and decay was more stark than it had been in 198l.",5
418,"Images of ‘urban decay’, ‘tinderbox cities’, and ‘ghetto streets’ linked up with the images of ‘race inequality’and ‘black ghettos’to produce an analysis more complex but also more contradictory.",5
419,An interesting mixture of the various images was provided by a story in the under the headline: ‘Broadwater Farm: Like the Divis Flats with Reggae’(8 October 1985).,5
420,"The described the estate as ‘Living Hell’, and quoted one resident as saying that ‘You've no idea how awful daily life is’(8 October 1985).",5
421,"Such images were reworkings of arguments  already used about Toxteth in 1981 and Brixton in 1981, but they were used more widely than in 1980–1.",5
422,"Even the , which deployed the clearest use of ‘race’ and ‘outside agitator’arguments, ran a major story on Broadwater Farm under the headline: ‘Burnt-out hulks litter this concrete jungle…despair hangs heavy’(8 October 1985).",5
423,"A number of stories using such imagery were run by both the quality and the popular press during this period, but similar arguments are to be found in parliamentary debates (, vol. 84, 21 October 1985, cols. 30-.46, 388), and even in official reports produced by the police on the riots in Birmingham and London.",5
424,"The ‘cities of inner despair’ were conceived as the breeding ground for disorderly protest, and however hard the Government tried to break the causal link between the two, it was forced to take the need to restore order not only through the police but through promises of help for the inner cities.",5
425,"Much as in 1980–1, the ‘social causes’ argument cannot be seen separately from the broader debate about the future of the British economy and society.",5
426,"The Government's record on unemployment was a heavily politicized issue, and just as in 1981 it vehemently denied any responsibility for the riots through its pursuit of free-market policies.",5
427,But the Government did find a way of accepting a link between the riots and social problems without bringing its main policies into the debate: namely by linking the growth of violent disorder to crime and drugs.,5
428,The emphasis on ‘crime’ and the ‘criminal acts’of the rioters in the official responses to the 1985 riots took a general and a specific form.,5
429,"The general form relied on the argument that the riots were not a form of protest against the insufferable social conditions of inner-city areas or the actions of the police, but a ‘criminal act’ or a ‘cry for loot’.",5
430,"This was an argument put most succinctly by Geoffrey Dear, Chief Constable of the West Midlands (Dear, 1985) and by Douglas Hurd, the Home Secretary, Handsworth.",5
431,But it recurred as a theme in official and press responses to the other riots.,5
432,"The specific form was built upon the notion that the outbreak of violence in Handsworth and Brixton, , was brought about by ‘drug barons’ who saw the police attempting to curb their activities and control ‘their  territory’.",5
433,"Numerous examples of this line of argument can be found in Dear's report on Handsworth, and in press coverage during the riots.",5
434,"Taking the specific argument about the role of drugs and ‘drug barons’ in stimulating the riots, this seems to have served two purposes.",5
435,"First, it distanced the riots from the social, economic, political, and other grievances which had been linked to them by locating the cause outside the ‘social problems’ of inner-city dwellers and in the ‘simple greed’of the drug barons to accumulate ‘loot’.",5
436,"Second, just as Dear's image of a few hundred ‘young black criminals’ was used to explain what happened in Handsworth, the problem of drugs was used to explain what happened at a national level.",5
437,"The issue of drugs provided an everyday image, already a national issue through saturation media coverage and public debate, around which the police, the Home Office, and other institutions could depoliticize the riots.",5
438,"Responding to the Handsworth events Douglas Hurd was moved to argue forcibly that such events were senseless and reflected more on those who participated in them than on the society in which they took place: ‘The sound which law abiding people in Handsworth heard on Monday night, the echoes of which I picked up on Tuesday, was not a cry for help but a cry for loot’(, 13 September 1985).",5
439,"The Chief Constable for the West Midlands, Geoffrey Dear, took this argument further by pointing out that the day before the riots a successful carnival had taken place, with the support of local community leaders.",5
440,"He drew the conclusion from this that the riot ‘came like a bolt the blue’(, 21 November 1985).",5
441,"Such language focused attention on the individuals or groups who were ‘breaking the law’, ‘committing criminal acts’, and threatening the interests of the law-abiding ‘majority’.",5
442,SYMBOLIC POLITICS AND POLICY INITIATIVES,5
443,"The 1980–1 and 1985 riots resulted in a wide variety of responsive measures, emanating from both central and local government, other agencies.",5
444,The very multiplicity of ideological constructions of the riots is an indication of the complexity of the  responses which resulted in policies and programmes of action.,5
445,"There are, however, three analytically distinct and important political and policy responses which need to be examined:(a) the Scarman Report;(b) policing and law and order (c) economic and social policies.",5
446,The Scarman Report,5
447,"In the aftermath of the April 1981 riots in Brixton the Home Secretary, William Whitelaw, used his powers under the 1964 Police Act to appoint Lord Scarman to inquire into the events, produce a report, and make recommendations.",5
448,This brief was subsequently widened to cover the occurrence of other disturbances during July 1981.,5
449,"Lord Scarman's inquiry was not on the same scale as the famous Kerner Report in 1968 on the US riots, but since the publication of his Report in November 1981 his views and prescriptions have played an important role in fashioning political debate about the riots.",5
450,"It is therefore important to look into the basic analysis which the Scarman Report puts forward to understand how the political agenda has developed, the riots, since 1980.",5
451,The starting-point of Lord Scarman's explanation of the riots is important.,5
452,His analysis began by distinguishing between the background factors which had created the potential for urban disorder in areas Brixton and the precipitating action or event which sparked off the riots.,5
453,Scarman identified two views that were commonly held the causation of the disorders.,5
454,"The first explained them oppressive policing, and the harassment of young blacks.",5
455,The second explained them as a protest against society by deprived people who saw violent attacks upon the forces of law and order as a way of calling attention to their grievances.,5
456,"For Scarman both views were a simplification of a complex reality, or ‘not the whole truth’.",5
457,He linked the ‘social’ and ‘policing’aspects of the complex reality of areas like Brixton in an analytic model which emphasized the following issues:,5
458,1.,5
459,"the problems which are faced in policing and maintaining order in deprived, inner-city, multi-racial localities;",5
460,2.,5
461,"the social, economic, and related problems which are faced by all residents of such areas;",5
462,3.,5
463,"the social and economic disadvantages which are suffered particularly by black residents, especially young blacks.",5
464,"(Scarman, 1981, paras.",5
465,2. 1–2.38),5
466,"He saw the existence of all these features in certain deprived areas as ‘creating a predisposition towards violent protest’, which could be sparked off by incidents confrontations between local residents and the police or by rumours about the actions of the police or other authority figures.",5
467,From this account Lord Scarman drew the conclusion that once the ‘predisposition towards violent protest’ had taken hold it was difficult to reverse.,5
468,"Talking about the position of young blacks, he noted that because they felt neither ‘socially nor economically secure’ many of them had drifted into situations where more or less regular confrontations with the police were the norm of their daily experience.",5
469,"Noting that despite the evidence of academic and government reports, which had pointed to widespread discrimination against young blacks, very little had been done to remedy the position, Scarman concluded that:(a) many young blacks believed that violence was an effective means of protest against their conditions; and (b) far from the riots being a meaningless event, they were ‘essentially an outburst of anger and resentment by young black people against the police’(Scarman, 1981, paras.",5
470,3. 110 and 2.38).,5
471,"What is important to note here is that Lord Scarman's condemnation of the ‘criminal acts’ committed during the riots, the Report was a strong argument a historical and social explanation of the riots.",5
472,"Given the close link which the Scarman Report established between questions of policing and the ‘wider social context’, the programme of action which it outlined contained proposals not only about the reform of the police and the introduction of new methods of policing and riot control, but about employment policy, social policy, and policies on racial discrimination.",5
473,In a telling phrase Lord Scarman argued: ‘The social conditions in Brixton do not provide an excuse for disorder.,5
474,"But the disorders  cannot be fully understood unless they are seen in the context of complex political, social and economic factors which together create a predisposition towards violent protest’(para. 8.7).",5
475,"Although some of these issues went beyond the main remit of his Inquiry, he drew the conclusion from this basic finding that only a national government-led initiative to deal with problems of policing, unemployment, poor housing, and racial disadvantage could get to the roots of the unrest.",5
476,"Parliamentary and media responses to the Report varied greatly, although it was widely seen as making an important contribution to the debate about how to respond to the riots and prevent the outbreak of violence in the future.",5
477,"But what became clear after the immediate debate on the Report in late 1981 and early 1982, was that the Government was not going to implement all the recommendations.",5
478,"Some aspects of its proposals for reforming the police and rethinking police tactics were implemented during 1982 and 1983, but evidence of the ‘urgent action’ which it called for in other areas remained difficult to find.",5
479,"This returns us to the earlier point about the other major forces which contributed to the development of political responses to the riots: namely the media, Parliament, the political parties, and popular ‘common-sense’ debate.",5
480,"The Scarman Report formed a part — and a vital one — of this process of political debate, but its role cannot be understood in isolation.",5
481,This can be seen if we look more closely at the issues of policing and economic and social problems.,5
482,Policing and law and order,5
483,"Indeed, in the aftermath of the Scarman Report's publication, police opinion was divided on the question of whether its proposals for reforming the police and the adoption of new methods of policing could be implemented, or whether such changes could insure against further violence and unrest.",5
484,"The policy responses after the 1985 riots show some of the same characteristics as those during 1980–1, but as argued earlier, the emphasis on the ‘criminality’ of the riot participants favoured explanations that linked disorder to the pathological characteristics  of inner-city residents which pushed them towards lawlessness and crime.",5
485,"This in turn produced a sharper contrast than in 1980–1 between (a) responses which emphasized the need to strengthen and buttress the role of the police, and (b) responses which called for greater emphasis on the rejuvenation of the social and economic fabric of the inner cities.",5
486,Economic and social policies,5
487,economic and social policies the impact of the 1980–1 riots was equally ambiguous and contradictory.,5
488,"Part of this ambiguity, as outlined above, resulted from the Government's strenuous efforts to deny any link between its policies and the outbreak of violence and disorder.",5
489,"This denial was particularly important, since at the time the Thatcher administration was going through a bad period popular opinion on issues unemployment, social services, and housing.",5
490,"While Lord Scarman was careful not to enter the political dispute between the Government and the Labour party on issues unemployment and housing, his call for more direct action to deal with these problems, racial disadvantage, posed a challenge to the political legitimacy of the policies which the Government had followed from 1979 onwards.",5
491,"It also posed a delicate problem for the Home Secretary himself, since Lord Scarman had been appointed by him to carry out his Inquiry.",5
492,"Having spent the whole summer denying any link between its policies and the riots, the Government had to tread warily in responding to the economic and social policy proposals of the Scarman Report when it was published in November 1981.",5
493,The parliamentary debate on the Report showed the Home Secretary adopting a two-pronged strategy in his response.,5
494,"First, he accepted many of the recommendations of the Report, particularly the role of the police.",5
495,"Additionally, he accepted the need to tackle racial disadvantage and other social issues.",5
496,"Second, he emphasized the Government's view that, whatever broader measures were taken to deal with racial and social inequalities, the immediate priority was to restore and maintain order on the streets.",5
497,When the Home Secretary talked of  the need for the Government to give a lead in tackling racial disadvantage he therefore saw this as in issue for the longer term.,5
498,"On the other hand, he was much more specific about the reform of the police and the development of new tactics and equipment for the management of urban disorder (, vol. 14, 10 December 1981: cols. 1001–8).",5
499,"In 1985, however, the Government specifically rejected calls for another inquiry like Lord Scarman's, arguing that since the riots were a ‘criminal enterprise’ it was useless to search for social explanations or to have yet another report advising it about what to do.",5
500,"Implicitly, the Government was saying that it knew what the problems were, and how they could be tackled.",5
501,"While some senior policemen, like Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Kenneth Newman, wanted to stress the link between the police and other areas of ‘social policy’(Metropolitan Police, 1986), the official government response attempted to decontextualize the riots and see them as the actions of a small minority who were either criminalized or influenced by extreme political ideas.",5
502,The dominant approach of the Government attempted to emphasize two main arguments.,5
503,1.,5
504,"that the riots were ‘a lust for blood’, an ‘orgy of thieving’, ‘a cry for loot and not a cry for help’;",5
505,2.,5
506,"that the riots did not reflect a failure to carry out the ‘urgent programme of action’ recommended by Lord Scarman in 1981, but were the outcome of a spiralling wave of crime and disorder in inner-city areas.",5
507,"The logic of this approach, articulated by Home Secretary Douglas Hurd most clearly, was that the riots were both ‘unjustifiable’ and a ‘criminal activity’.",5
508,In a widely reported speech to police chiefs at the time of the disorders Hurd made this point clear:,5
509,Handsworth needs more jobs and better housing.,5
510,But riots only destroy.,5
511,They create nothing except a climate in which necessary development is even more difficult.,5
512,"Poor housing and other social ills provide no kind of reason for riot, arson and killing.",5
513,One interviewer asked me whether the riot was not a cry for help by the rioters.,5
514,The sound which law-abiding people heard at Handsworth was not a cry for help but a cry for loot.,5
515,"That is why the first priority, once public order is secure, must be a  thorough and relentless investigation into the crimes which were committed.",5
516,"(, 14 September 1985)",5
517,Such arguments resonated through the media and in the various parliamentary debates during September and October 1985.,5
518,They became part of the symbolic political language through which the riots were understood by policy makers and by popular opinion.,5
519,"Since the 1985 unrest, and particularly after the 1987 General Election, the Government has announced a number of initiatives on the inner city, and it has presented these as part of an effort to rejuvenate depressed areas on a sound basis.",5
520,"The evidence that has emerged since then, however, points to a major discrepancy between the Government's promises of action and the allocation of resources to implement them (Robson, 1988).",5
521,"It is perhaps too early to reach a conclusion on this point, but a repeat of the period of inaction between 1982 and 1985 seems to be evident, within the current political context.",5
522,"A number of local authorities have attempted to take more positive action to deal with the issues raised by the 1985 riots, but their experience has shown that such local initiatives are often severely limited by the actions of national government, the police, and broader economic and political pressures.",5
523,"In the years since 1981 the one consistent response to urban unrest has been the provision of more resources, more training, and more equipment to the police.",5
524,"tackling the causes of urban unrest, the Government has built up force to deal with the manifestation of those root conditions.",5
525,"Increasingly the most strident political voices are raised in the name of free enterprise and law and order, not for equity and social justice.",5
526,"For the New Right and other influential sectors of political opinion the attempt to achieve racial equality through legal and political means is naïve political folly, and a restriction on the workings of the market.",5
527,"The present political climate gives little cause for optimism that a radical change in governmental priorities in this field is likely (Solomos, 1989).",5
528,"The Government's plan of (DoE, 1987), issued  after Mrs Thatcher's post-election promise, says very little directly about racial inequality.",5
529,It remains to be seen whether it will suffer the fate of numerous other initiatives on the inner cities and fade into obscurity.,5
530,But one thing seems clear: during the past decade the Government has been more intent on reducing the powers of local authorities than on providing for fundamental changes in the social conditions of the inner cities.,5
531,CONCLUSION: LITTLE ROOM FOR OPTIMISM,5
532,"Despite the Government's recently proclaimed intention of regenerating the inner cities, there is little room for optimism.",5
533,"Unless radical action is taken, British cities seem poised to become yet more turbulent, brutalized, and trouble-torn.",5
534,The excluded black and white citizens in the urban areas seem set to continue to suffer deprivation and disadvantage.,5
535,"The remedy of using tough policing is merely tackling the symptoms of the disorder, and is liable to exacerbate the underlying malaise.",5
536,"This approach should come as no surprise, however.",5
537,History shows that the usual response to violent protest and riots was repression.,5
538,History also shows that this course was normally ineffective and that disorder only diminished when movement was made in the direction of the reforms which were demanded.,5
539,"The auguries for such reforms are not good, and further urban unrest remains in prospect.",5

542,FULL CIRCLE?,5
543,"On 13 May 1833 the National Political Union, a body organized to seek the extension of the franchise to the working class, held a meeting in Coldbath Fields, in Clerkenwell, London.",5
544,"This was to become a celebrated and controversial rite of passage for the new Metropolitan Police, then not quite four years old.",5
545,"Fighting broke out between participants and the police, during which a constable, PC Culley, was fatally stabbed.",5
546,"An inquest jury, rapidly assemble in a nearby inn, returned a verdict of ‘justifiable homicide’.",5
547,"This was quashed on appeal to the Court of King's Bench, but it symbolized the deep and widespread popular suspicion which attended the birth of Peel's ‘New Police’.",5
548,"For the conventional ‘cop-sided’ histories of British police development, Coldbath Fields marks the crucial turning-point in their battle to win consent for their very existence.",5
549,From the middle of the eighteenth century onwards a growing chorus of voices had championed the creation of a professional police.,5
550,"But they were successfully resisted by a rejectionist front which encompassed a variety of social interests and philosophies, ranging from rural Tory gentry to urban working-class radicals.",5
551,"Upper-class objectors worried about traditional civil liberties, central government encroachment on the delicate network of power relations in local parishes, and the expense of a public police.",5
552,"Working-class hostility was roused by the fear of the police being used to control industrial and political organization, and to curb their recreational activities under the guise of maintaining public order in the streets.",5
553,This alliance of opposition frustrated all attempts to establish a professional police until Peel's 1829 Metropolitan Police Act.,5
554,"In the conventional view Coldbath Fields was a shock to respectable consciences, and rallied the support of all but the dangerous classes to the Peelers.",5
555,"In fact, however, resistance to the new police continued to be expressed in the street violence and riots as ‘the plague of blue locusts’ spread throughout the country between 1829 and 1856, and as it came to the working class communities of the North (Storch, 1975, p. 94).",5
556,"Indeed, working-class assent to policing has arguably always been hesitant and brittle (Cohen, 1979; Brogden, 1982).",5
557,When PC Keith Blakelock was stabbed to death on 6 October 1985 during the rioting in the Broadwater Farm Estate he was the first Metropolitan policeman to be killed in a riot since PC Culley in 1833.,5
558,"The parallel with Coldbath Fields dramatically symbolizes the way that policing, crime, and public order have turned full circle back to echo early Victorian conditions.",5
559,"The urban disorders of the 1980s are the most explicit index of the deep hostility now felt by many inner-city residents towards the police, and of the problems of policing the inner city.",5
560,Nor are the parallels confined to the inner city.,5
561,"Another dramatic instance of historical came during the miners' strike, when it was reported that an attack had been made on the police station in Malby, South Yorkshire, scene of an anti-police riot a century earlier when the ‘new police’ first arrived there.",5
562,More recently a moral panic about ‘lager louts’ despoiling rural Arcadias has emerged.,5
563,"What has been rudely shattered is the cosy depiction of British history as the progressive ‘conquest of violence’(Critchley, 1970) which is celebrated in the conventional accounts of the British police (Reith, 1938, 1943, 1956; Critchley, 1967; Ascoli, 1979; Stead, 1985).",5
564,"But if the long-term trajectory of ‘law and order’ in Britain is not the unilinear march of civility which may once have seemed plausible, what is it?",5
565,"And how are we to understand and deal with the contemporary return of the repressed, spiralling levels of recorded crime and riotous disorder?",5
566,"In this chapter I shall try to locate our present concerns in a pattern of historical development, and seek to excavate from this a prognosis for the viability of current strategies and initiatives.",5
567,A CRISIS OF ‘LAW AND ORDER’: MORAL PANIC OR REASONABLE CONCERN?,5
568,"In the conventional view, Britain, once a legend throughout the world for its stolid, peaceable, and harmonious character, has experienced in the last decade and a half an alien and shocking advent of unprecedented incivility and disorder.",5
569,"At the visible apex of this trend come the urban disorders of Brixton and Bristol, Toxteth and Tottenham.",5
570,"Underneath lies the more regular procession of smaller-scale crowd disturbances, political, industrial, and recreational.",5
571,"Even less visible except to immediate participants and police is the routine ‘slow rioting’ of Saturday night street brawling, which (the perceptions of all the chiefs constables I have interviewed in a research project over the last year) is assuming more menacing and violent proportions throughout the country.",5
572,"Beneath it all is a growing wave of individual crimes, adding a crisis of law and order.",5
573,This conventional view is summed up by the dominant reactions to the 1981 Brixton disorders.,5
574,"Lord Scarman referred to violence and disorder ‘the like of which had not previously been seen in this century in Britain’, while one Conservative MP summed up this orthodox reaction in a parliamentary debate (on 13 April 1981) when he spoke of the riots as ‘something new and sinister in our long national history’.",5
575,The initial response of the Left and liberals to this reaction was to dub the conventional wisdom ‘moral panic’.,5
576,"What was new was the growth of a strong state control apparatus, legitimated by the fears generated by manipulation of public anxiety.",5
577,"It was pointed out that the rose-tinted spectacles view, Britain has a long history of riot and disorder.",5
578,"The conventional perspective is guilty of ‘historical amnesia’, which has forgotten the turbulent and bloody conflicts of the past (see, , Benyon, 1985).",5
579,The most thorough-going and influential example of this genre of debunking moral panic is Hooligan by Geoff Pearson (1983).,5
580,"This is a deservedly much-admired, fascinating, and lovingly collected parade of paranoia through the ages.",5
581,"Moving backwards, through four centuries of history, Pearson shows a  perennial refrain lamenting a supposedly shocking increase in crime, violence, and public disorder.",5
582,Each period seems to construct its own mythical golden age ‘twenty years ago’.,5
583,But Pearson assiduously shows how the grandads of that supposed era of tranquillity were themselves bemoaning the sad decline of standards of virtue and discipline since youth.,5
584,", in a potentially infinite regress of grandadology, wailing and gnashing teeth at the decline of family life, parental irresponsibility, declining national character, and the need for a firm reassertion of authority.",5
585,"‘Street violence and disorder are solidly entrenched features of the social landscape’, argues Pearson, at any rate in capitalist societies which necessarily generate a ‘residuum’, an under-class of the underprivileged and unemployed, unintegrated and potentially threatening to the established and respectable.",5
586,"If this reserve army is always with us, so is social reaction to it: an ‘immovable preoccupation’ with ‘the awesome spectre of crime and violence perpetually spiralling upwards’.",5
587,This perspective offers a useful corrective to the historical perception of recent levels of crime and disorder as utterly foreign and novel in British experience.,5
588,But the critique runs the danger of becoming a facile agnosticism about patterns or trends in crime and disorder.,5
589,"Piecing together a catalogue of recurring laments neither answers nor dismisses the still pertinent question: are things really getting worse, getting better, or remaining the same?",5
590,"It is as if an economic historian, collating woeful editorials every few years, were to conclude that there really were no business-cycles, longer-term Kondratieff waves of growth and decline.",5
591,"Furthermore, the litanies of ‘respectable fears’ and ‘moral panics’are only one of the discourses about ‘law and order’found in popular, political, or academic discussion over the last century.",5
592,"At the turn of the century, the very time when Pearson documents the coinage of the term ‘hooligan’ to portray a supposedly new breed of youthful folk-devil, there is found in other sources a mood of contemporary congratulation about the long-term conquest of the problem of order.",5
593,The Criminal Registrar's Report for 1901 documents a trend for declining levels of crime and violence over two decades.,5
594,The introduction  comments: ‘We have witnessed a great change in manners: the substitution of words without blows for blows with or without words; an approximation in the manners of different classes; a decline in the spirit of lawlessness.’,5
595,Nor was this position unique.,5
596,"The latest volume of the magisterial (Radzinowicz and Hood, 1986, vol. 5) shows that criminologists at the turn of the century were vexed with explaining the puzzling phenomenon of English success in conquering routine crime and violence.",5
597,Not that all was well in the sphere of order and crime.,5
598,"On the one hand, there was a variety of political and industrial threats to the order of the established classes.",5
599,"The Fenian menace legitimated the establishment of a specifically political police, which would have been utterly unacceptable in the climate of early nineteenth-century Britain (Porter, 1987).",5
600,"The industrial conflicts of the first quarter of this century stimulated a new level of centralization and sophistication in the state's coercive response to the labour movement (Morgan, 1987).",5
601,"But what differentiates the earlier part of this century from either the present or the early nineteenth century is that these problems did not all coalesce into one disturbing image of a threatening, dangerous, and disorderly criminal class.",5
602,"Various types of criminal — the political, the habitual and the recidivist, the feeble-minded, the inebriate, the juvenile — were all differentiated as separate specimens in the taxonomies of the new science of criminology (Garland, 1985).",5
603,"And with the cognitive optimism of criminology was combined a penological optimism, that the new forms of scientifically grounded interventions would provide a solution to the problems of crime.",5
604,"This penal optimism reigned throughout the first half of this century (Bailey, 1987).",5
605,Right down from the last quarter of the nineteenth century to the 1960s one can indeed construct a counter-grandadology to Pearson's ‘history of respectable fears’.,5
606,"It is possible to catalogue a chorus of social self-congratulation, as respectable commentators recount the positive achievement of tranquillity since the days of their youth, as the very epitome of social progress.",5
607,"This mood is captured, , in Leonard Woolf's autobiography (1960):",5
608,I am struck by the immense change from social barbarism to social civilisation which has taken place in London (indeed in Great Britain) during my lifetime.,5
609,but an old Londoner who has been born and bred and has lived for 50 to 60 years in London can have any idea of the extent of the change.,5
610,It is amazing to walk down Drury Lane or the small streets about 7 Dials today and recall their condition only 50 years ago.,5
611,Even as late as 1900 it would not have been safe to walk in any of these streets after dark.,5
612,This is not intended to supplant Pearson's perennial panic view with a resuscitated Whig theory of progress.,5
613,"The point is only that there long-term trends and patterns in crime, violence, and disorder.",5
614,"There may be a perennial fascination with the crimes which do exist, but more sober analytic or reflective assessments have not always been pessimistic or anguished.",5
615,"It may evoke nostalgia now, or appear quaintly naïve, but there have been periods when crime and disorder seemed soluble, if not yet totally vanished, problems.",5
616,IS CRIME INCREASING?,5
617,"The statistics on crime, for all the familiar pitfalls in their interpretation, should not be dismissed.",5
618,"They can be judiciously appraised, with an open eye for trends which may affect the relation between recorded and unrecorded crime, in combination with broader consideration of historical and theoretical issues which may affect their validity.",5
619,"The major studies of the long-term trends in crime statistics (Gurr, 1976, 1981; Gatrell and Hadden, 1972; Gatrell, 1980) concur in depicting a secular decline in the latter decades of the nineteenth century.",5
620,"This coincided, however, with an increasing prevalence of the conditions and institutions which should lead us to expect the reporting and recording of offences to grow the actual occurrence of victimization.",5
621,"As a noted historian of crime recently argued, the decrease in levels of recorded crime ‘coincides with increased court activity, with the spread and professionalisation of the new police, and with an apparent increase in public cooperation with both courts and the police.",5
622,"If the radical criminologists' assumptions are correct, then the figures for the second half of the  19th century might probably show the opposite from that which they do’(Emsley, 1988, p. 42).",5
623,The secular trend towards declining levels of crime levelled off in the first decade of this century.,5
624,The recorded rate of crime then remains on a rough plateau until the end of the 1930s.,5
625,"During the late 1930s and early 1940s there is a fairly sharp rise, but then again a rough plateau (albeit with sharp year-by-year fluctuations) in the late 1940s until the mid-1950s, when there begins a sustained and sharp increase, getting ever steeper in the late 1970s and 1980s.",5
626,"From 1975 onwards the rising crime-rate is justifiably referred to as in a stage of ‘hyper-crisis’(Kinsey .,",5
627,1986 p. 12).,5
628,"While in the quarter-century from 1950 to 1975 recorded notifiable offences per 100,000 population increased by just over 3,000, from 1,094 to 4,283, it took just the decade from 1976 to 1986 for crimes per 100,000 population to increase another 3,000, from 4,346 to 7,331 (, 1986, Table 2.2).",5
629,"In the late nineteenth century the trend to lower levels of recorded crime coincided with developments which, other things being equal, would lead us to expect rising levels of recording.",5
630,This buttresses confidence that the recorded trend is in the correct direction.,5
631,"But can we be sure that the last three decades of sustained growth in crime are not a recording phenomenon (Bottomley and Pease, 1986)?",5
632,The plain answer is that we cannot be certain about it.,5
633,"At the same time as recorded levels of crime have increased, so have many other factors which might increase the propensity of the public to report, and the police to record, offences.",5
634,"Police numbers and resources, , have increased considerably.",5
635,"The number of police-officers in England and Wales grew from nearly 76,000 in 1961 to nearly 110,00 in 1976, and nearly 122,000 in 1986. police strength his not, however, kept pace with the increase in recorded crime.",5
636,"In 1961 there were 11 crimes recorded per police-officer, but by 1986 this had grown to 32.",5
637,"Even taking account of the increase in other resources available to augment police-officers, from civilian support staff to more sophisticated technology of all kinds, there is clearly a much greater recorded crime work-load per police-officer.",5
638,The only way that we could definitely ascertain the extent of  the increase in recorded crime which is changes in reporting and/or recording practices would be if there were available victimization data over a long period.,5
639,"Such data is available for the United States since 1973, when the Federal Government initiated an annual series of National Crime Surveys.",5
640,"Overall these indicate that while the rate of victimization recorded in the annual surveys increase in the 1970s and 1980s, this was at a substantially lower rate (1 on average) than the officially recorded crime-rate (3.5–5 average annual increase; cf.",5
641,"Box, 1987, pp. 18–20).",5
642,"Moreover, the global index of either victimization or recorded offences can be misleading, it conceals quite large variations in the trends for specific offences.",5
643,", what the United States data imply is that the upward trend in recorded crime is in the same direction as actual victimization, although at a slower rate.",5
644,"The recorded figures exaggerate the increase in victimization which is occurring, mainly a greater public propensity to report certain crimes.",5
645,The experience in the United States cannot necessarily be extrapolated to the United Kingdom.,5
646,"In Britain there have been three national crime surveys, in 1982, 1984, and 1988.",5
647,Overall.,5
648,"between these years, the increase in victimization measured by the survey (30 ) roughly matches the increase of police recorded offences (41 ).",5
649,But this cannot be taken as for assuming that long-term recorded crime trends correspond to victimization.,5
650,"Not only is a comparison between only three years potentially misleading; there are very considerable divergences between trends in victimization and recorded crime for specific offences, which are concealed by the coincidence in the overall direction (Hough and Mayhew, 1985, Dowds .,",5
651,1989).,5
652,"It is often pointed out that the long-running set of victimization data in Britain, the General Household Survey's regular measurement of the extent of burglary victimization since 1972, indicates that most of the increase in recorded burglary is a reporting phenomenon.",5
653,"Combining the General Household Survey (GHS) and the British Crime Survey (BCS) victimization data reveals that while police-recorded burglaries doubled between 1972 and  1983, the level of victimization went up only by 20 (Hough and Mayhew, 1985, pp. 16–17).",5
654,Thus the considerable increase in recorded burglary during the 1970s was largely a recording phenomenon.,5
655,But this may not apply to other offences.,5
656,"Furthermore, the BCS points out (ibid.) that the gap between the trend in recorded burglaries and victimization is much lower in recent years: there has been an appreciable increase in burglary victimization between 1981 and 1983 of 9 , while recorded burglaries increased by 24 .",5
657,If this gap continues to narrow then the recorded trend of burglaries may be more confidently interpreted as showing the direction of crime.,5
658,"In conclusion, it seems that we cannot accept without question the dramatic increase in recorded crime as corresponding to a real increase in victimization of the same proportions.",5
659,"But it would be wishful thinking to explain away all, or even most, of the increase as an artefact of recording changes.",5
660,"We can plausibly infer that crime has been increasing in the last two to three decades, presenting a problem for explanation and policy.",5
661,CRIME AND INNER CITIES,5
662,"While crime overall has been increasing, it must be emphasized that both the reality and the fear of victimization are considerably greater in some areas than others.",5
663,"The British Crime Survey found, , that (as classified by the ACORN ‘Classification of Residential Neighbourhoods’ system) there were three types of area which were especially prone to both crime and fear of crime: ‘High-status non-family areas’(I), ‘Multi-racial areas’(H), and ‘Poorest council estates’(G).",5
664,"Whereas the national average frequency of being a ‘mugging’ victim (robbery/theft from the person) was 1.4 , in these areas it was: I: 3.9 ; H: 4.3 ; G: 3.3 .",5
665,"In the last two areas, the proportions of people who were ‘very worried about mugging’ were 32 and 36 , compared to an average of 20 , and (11 in rural areas — these data evidently precede the advent of lager loutishness!).",5
666,"Whereas on average 2.4 of households were victimized by burglary, in the high-risk areas it was 6.3 (Hough and Mayhew, 1985, Table M).",5
667,"These  findings are replicated by the recent local crime surveys, notably those in Merseyside and Islington, which have constituted the empirical core of the ‘New Left realism’ in criminology (Kinsey, 1985; Jones .,",5
668,1986).,5
669,"The Merseyside Crime Survey found, , that 44 of interviewees had been victims of crime in the last twelve months, and a quarter had been victimized twice or more.",5
670,Multiple victimization (two or more experiences) was twice as high in inner-city areas as in affluent suburbs.,5
671,Fear of crime varied accordingly.,5
672,"Crime was seen as a big problem by 66 in inner-city Liverpool, compared with 13 in wealthier suburbs (Kinsey .,",5
673,"1986, p. 4).",5
674,"David Downes (1983) aptly summed up the irony of ‘law and order’ being seen as a Conservative concern, when he called it ‘theft of an issue’.",5
675,"POLICING, ORDER AND LEGITIMACY",5
676,Rising crime is not an inevitable nor universal problem.,5
677,It was noted above that for an extended period of our history crime was actually falling.,5
678,"The overall trajectory since the early nineteenth century seems to be a rough U-shape: falling down to the early 1900s, a plateau until the mid-1950s, and a steepening rise since then.",5
679,It is plausible that disorder follows a similar pattern.,5
680,"It has been shown, , that levels of violence during industrial disputes fell in the first three-quarters of this century, but that this trend has been reversed more recently (Geary, 1985).",5
681,"If crime and disorder follow a U-shape pattern of long-term change, the legitimacy of the police — the extent to which they are broadly accepted as valid in mission and methods — has followed an inverse path: an upside-down U. Starting from the widespread opposition encountered at the birth of the new police, opposition gradually came to be located primarily within the less ‘respectable’ sections of the working class, in the wider working class during periods of labour conflict.",5
682,"Even here, as the fact of policing came to be established, opposition was not to the police , but to specific operations or tactics.",5
683,"By the late 1940s and 1950s, the advent of post-war political consensus and social integration was the precondition for the police achieving a pinnacle of widespread popular acceptance.",5
684,"This was symbolized in the  phenomenon: the only time that a cosy, non-action-man, ordinary uniform bobby has attained heroic stature in a country's folk-lore.",5
685,"But it was confirmed by harder evidence, above all by the national survey conducted for the 1960 Royal Commission on the Police.",5
686,"This found not only a generally high level of support for the police, but that this spread throughout the class structure (indeed was marginally higher in the working class).",5
687,"The very fact that a series of comparatively minor incidents had triggered the establishment of the Royal Commission as the only comprehensive review of the organization of policing in a century, is testimony to the widespread consensus about policing.",5
688,"Since the 1950s policing has become a highly controversial, politicized issue.",5
689,"More recent poll evidence (e.g. for the British Crime Survey, or the British Social Attitudes Survey by Jowell .,",5
690,1988) continues to show high overall acceptance of the police.,5
691,But this must be qualified in two crucial ways.,5
692,"First, there is a widespread perception recorded in the surveys of specific types of police malpractice coming to be perceived as problematic, e.g. corruption and racial discrimination.",5
693,"Second, there is a considerable and growing rejection of the overall legitimacy of the police among some sections of the population: youth, the economically marginal, and ethnic minorities especially Afro-Caribbeans.",5
694,", the Policy Studies Institute found that while 29 of Londoners overall thought the police treat particular groups unfairly, this rose to 68 amongst young West Indians (Smith, 1983, pp. 243–6).",5
695,"How can these recent trends (rising crime and disorder, and falling police legitimacy) be explained?",5
696,"CRIME, DEPRIVATION, AND MORALITY",5
697,"Criminologists have scarcely addressed, answered, the broad questions of explaining overall trends in crime.",5
698,Positivist research has generated much data about specific relationships between individual or social characteristics and the likelihood of conviction.,5
699,Radical approaches have been characterized more by theoretical or programmatic work than by grounded accounts or changing crime patterns.,5
700,"Even the recent ‘New Left realism’ does  not address the broader questions of causation, though its leading exponent Jock Young (1986) has rightly emphasized the need to return aetiological questions to the foreground.",5
701,"But so far their explanation of rising crime has largely focused on alleged deficiencies in police strategy, on counter-productive militaristic tactics which exacerbate ‘public alienation’ and therefore impede successful crime control (Kinsey .,",5
702,"1986, pp. 40–2).",5
703,"Admittedly the vicious cycle of police militarization and public alienation is seen to be kicked into play by the economic crumbling of the inner city, but thereafter the weight of the explanation is placed on inadequate (or over-heavy) policing.",5
704,"As will be indicated below, I do not feel that much (if any) of the explanation can lie at the door of the police station.",5
705,"More plausible is the analysis developed in Dahrendorf's Hamlyn Lectures on ‘law and order’(Dahrendorf, 1985, 1987).",5
706,In this the main structural precondition of growing crime is seen as the growth of an underclass.,5
707,"The social prerequisite of the long trend in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries towards lower crime and disorder, and greater police acceptance, was the historical process of working-class incorporation.",5
708,"Uneven and limited though this might have been, the gulf between Disraeli's two nations in the early and mid-nineteenth century became blurred and attenuated by the twentieth.",5
709,"The sharp end of routine policing always falls on the economically marginal, those who live out their lives in public places which routine police patrols regulate, and those who are not integrated into the mainstream institutions of economic and political life.",5
710,"Incorporation of the working class reduced the adult part of this residuum to a politically insignificant, atomistic, albeit cyclically fluctuating stratum.",5
711,"The main grist to the mill of policing was working-class youth, but the perennial conflict between youth and the police is one with ever-changing persona and is not the basis of political conflict.",5
712,"This changed with the re-emergence of long-term structural unemployment, leading to the of increasing sections of the working class, ‘who are being defined the edifice of citizenship’(Dahrendorf, 1985, p. 98).",5
713,The underclass in Dahrendorf's account is not simply the product of unemployment.,5
714,It is the consequence of the apparent structural inevitability of its position: ‘The majority class does not need the unemployed to maintain and even increase its standard of living…,5
715,"The main point about this category — for lack of a better word we shall call it ‘under class'’— is that its destiny is perceived as hopeless' (Dahrendorf, 1985, pp. 101–7).",5
716,"Now there are problems with the simple postulation of a link between unemployment, crime, and disorder, as Mrs Thatcher is only too ready to point out.",5
717,"There is an enormous literature of research on the relationship, which the late Steven Box (1987) has usefully summarized and reviewed in his very important last book,.",5
718,Box summarizes some fifty research projects on the relationship between unemployment and crime.,5
719,"Most are aggregate studies, looking at the correlation over time or across space between levels of crime and unemployment.",5
720,He sums it up:,5
721,The relationship between overall unemployment and crime is inconsistent…on balance the weight of existing research supports there being a weak but significant causal relationship.,5
722,"However, properly targeted research on young males, particularly those from disadvantaged ethnic groups, which considers both the and of unemployment…has yet to be done’.",5
723,(pp. 96–7),5
724,"Much of this debate has been vitiated by the assumption that if unemployment is causally related to crime, this must be an invariable law: true at all times and places.",5
725,"But it is more plausible to suppose that the meaning of unemployment will vary a number of factors, e.g. its duration, social assessments of blame, previous experience of steady employment, perception of future prospects, comparison with other groups, etc.",5
726,"It would be too much, therefore, to expect that there would be a universal and invariant relation.",5
727,Some support for the link between offending and perceptions of the justice of unemployment is suggested by the research evidence on the connections of and crime.,5
728,"All the fifteen studies of this reviewed by Box suggest a strong association (over time or cross-sectionally) between economic inequality and crime (though this is not true  of five studies on homicide specifically)(Box, 1987, pp. 86–98).",5
729,"This plausibly supports the view that it is which is causally related to crime, and that in conditions where unemployment is perceived as unjust and hopeless by comparison with the lot of other groups, this will act as a precipitant of crime.",5
730,"Two recent studies, one American (Thornberry and Christenson, 1984) and one British (Farrington .,",5
731,"1986), have both used a novel methodology to establish that in the present climate unemployment linked to crime.",5
732,They have looked at the commission of offences reported over time by a sample of youths in longitudinal surveys.,5
733,What is shown is that crime-rates (especially for property offences) were higher during periods of unemployment than of employment.,5
734,"This suggests that holding constant other variables, the same youths commit more crimes while unemployed.",5
735,"That there should be a link between (a) unemployment and (b) relative poverty, and crime is hardly surprising.",5
736,"Both exacerbate the incentives to commit offences and erode the social controls which would otherwise encourage conformity (relative fearfulness of sanctions, perception of the justice of the system, involvement in conventional activities and relationships, etc.).",5
737,So it is clearly right to argue as Dahrendorf does that the emergence of an underclass excluded apparently permanently from dominant economic life is a potent condition of rising crime.,5
738,This is all grist to the mill of orthodox social democratic analyses of crime.,5
739,But it cannot be the whole story.,5
740,"First, there is the problem of rising crime during the so-called period of affluence.",5
741,"It is this indeed which prompted the first ‘new realisms’ in criminology.: the right-wing realism of James Q. Wilson and his associates in the United States (Wilson, 1975); and the ‘administrative realism’attributed by Jock Young to our own Home Office Research Unit (Young, 1986).",5
742,"If the rate of crime increases when the adverse social conditions which have been linked to it are becoming ameliorated, the answer must lie elsewhere: either in the failure of the criminal justice system to deliver sanctions with sufficient certainty or positiveness (the ‘New Right’ analysis), or in changes in the availability of criminal opportunities in the environment (administrative criminology).",5
743,"Dahrendorf accepts both these as possible contributions, but encompasses them within a much broader idea: the growth of , the failure of a social structure to instil adequate commitment to its conventional moral codes, as crystallized into the criminal law.",5
744,This is more profoundly a matter of the deeper cultural instilling of conformist values than of the effective threat of sanctions by the criminal justice system.,5
745,The idea of the failure of the agencies of socialization to instil discipline and moral values the effects of post-war ‘funk’ and permissiveness is a favourite stalking-horse of the right-wing populist criminology championed by Norman Tebbit and others (and in a more sophisticated version in Douglas Hurd's Tamworth and other speeches).,5
746,The Government has eagerly seized on the ‘evidence’ provided by the new affluent and rural urban ‘lager lout’folk-devils to deny any link between inner-city deprivation and crime.,5
747,"Instead, the finger is pointed at a common moral malaise over-liberalization and erosion of discipline (Patten, 1988).",5
748,"this pedigree, the opinions of the Left and of liberals have shied examination of the issue of morality crime.",5
749,"This is a great loss, because at root there is an integral relation between the ideas of crime and morality.",5
750,"Older Marxist criminologies (notably Bonger's) saw the link between economic conditions and crime precisely as lying in the culture of egoism which was stimulated by economic advance under capitalism (Bonger, 1916).",5
751,This is more evident than ever in recent years with the amorally materialistic culture which has been encouraged by the present Government's economic and social policies.,5
752,"(Labour beginning to pick up this theme:, 2 January 1989, p. 3.)",5
753,"But uncomfortable questions must also be raised about the less traditional and disciplinarian approaches to education, to family, and to other social institutions which Left and liberal opinion have championed.",5
754,What values we want to underpin social relations and criminal law?,5
755,How can these be instilled?,5
756,"These problems are ones well recognized and analysed, though not answered, by, , Durkheim's discussion of anomie (Fenton .,",5
757,1983) and Dahrendorf's of anomia.,5
758,"As both emphasize, moral education cannot proceed effectively in an economically unjust society.",5
759,This much is social  democratic orthodoxy.,5
760,"But less authoritarian forms of moral discipline be effective and if so, how are they to be achieved?",5
761,POLICING,5
762,Traditional Left analyses have a uniformly negative image of the police as a repressive apparatus of the state.,5
763,‘New Left realism’ specifically challenges this.,5
764,The nub of its argument is that policing is a necessary function which ideally should control the criminal victimization disproportionately afflicting the most vulnerable members of our society.,5
765,But it can only be performed well if there is a profound democratization of the structure of accountability.,5
766,the police do not perform their task satisfactorily.,5
767,"Their initial response to the growth of crime, which stemmed from rising unemployment and inequality, was heavy-handed and militaristic.",5
768,This was counter-productive in alienating those sectors of the community whose co-operation was essential to criminal investigation.,5
769,"Only by restoring the confidence of these sectors can crime control by the police be successful, and the prerequisite of this is democratic accountability to local communities.",5
770,"There is an unquestioned presumption here, which pervades current thinking about the police from all perspectives: that the effectiveness and quality of policing declined.",5
771,"The evidence presented for this by the ‘New Realists’ and others is the seemingly inexorable rise of crime and the decline of ‘clear-up’rates (Lea .,",5
772,1987).,5
773,Between 1979 and 1986 the clear-up rate fell from 41 to 32 .,5
774,"But the clear-up rate is a notoriously inadequate measure of police effectiveness, open to manipulation by many factors policing skills (Reiner, 1988a).",5
775,"To take the most obvious arithmetical point, if the number of crimes per police officer increases, then, other things being equal, the detection rate fall, efficiency remains constant.",5
776,"In a recent study Lea and Young recognize this point, and say that the best indicator of police performance in crime investigation is the number of crimes cleared per officer (Lea .,",5
777,1987).,5
778,"What they do say is that on this ‘best’ measure, police performance has in  fact marginally, not declined (from 7.9 in 1972 to 9.6 in 1986.)",5
779,"Clearly in the last twenty years there has been growing controversy about fundamental aspects of policing, unprecedented in this century.",5
780,"(Reiner, 1985, charts and tries to explain this.)",5
781,"But, to put it provocatively, the growth of conflict over policing, and evidence of increasing public hostility and questioning, does not itself establish that standards of policing have declined.",5
782,(When looking at crime trends criminologists are usually hesitant about inferring objective worsening of problems on the basis of moral panics.),5
783,There are many reasons to expect that standards of policing should have improved.,5
784,"There has, , been a progressive improvement in the educational standards of recruits, and in the quantity and quality of police training.",5
785,Perhaps it is not so much that police behaviour has deteriorated as that public expectations have risen.,5
786,"What, it will be said, about the ‘obvious’ evidence of brutality and corruption?",5
787,"While there are, , many recent of police abuse (Reiner, 1985, ch. 2. 2), memoirs of earlier times (e.g. Mark, 1978; Daley, 1986) suggest that there was an enormous extent of subterranean wrong-doing in the cosy days of the traditional bobby on the beat.",5
788,"For obvious reasons the dangers of such malpractice are endemic in policing, and it may be ‘respectable fears’ about it which fluctuate more than the extent of abuse.",5
789,"tactics evidently changed (in public order policing: McCabe .,",5
790,"1988; Northam, 1988), it is as plausible to see these as a reactive response to rising crime and disorder, as the spontaneous of them.",5
791,"The ‘New Realists’ see policing as the key to crime control, and accountability as the key to good policing.",5
792,"Paradoxically, this comes at a time when both the Conservative Government and the police themselves are much more cautious about the potential contribution of policing.",5
793,"Police numbers and resources are seen as a by the police or the Government (as Hurd, , made clear in his speech to the Police Foundation Conference in Oxford on 11 April 1988)— hardly surprising after nine ‘wasted’ years.",5
794,"There is in fact a remarkable cross-party congruence on the idea that the effectiveness of  criminal justice and policing depends on the ‘involvement of the community’, though the Government denies that this requires full local democratic control, consultation.",5
795,I am myself sceptical about whether the local democratic control espoused by the ‘New Realists’ would have the dramatic confidence-building effect claimed.,5
796,"In any case, the extent of central influence over policing has grown remorselessly and may not be reversible (Reiner, 1988b, 1989).",5
797,This implies that the accountability of central government policing is the more important problem to address.,5
798,CONCLUSION,5
799,"‘New realism’, like the old ‘law and order’ Conservatism, rejects the traditional social democratic analysis that there is no panacea for crime through criminal justice policy, whether of the Left or the Right.",5
800,"But the essential precondition for order is economic justice and welfare, without which moral socialization cannot take root as fragile coercion.",5
801,", in a just and thriving economy, an effective criminal justice system has important functions to perform.",5
802,It must show that serious offences against the criminal law will be effectively dealt with.,5
803,But it is not clear that the declining overall effectiveness of the police and of criminal justice is internal failings the overwhelming growth of work-load growing social and economic inequality coupled with moral deregulation.,5
804,"The Inner-City Battlefield: Politics, Ideology, and Social Relations",5
805,Susanne MacGregor,5
806,INTRODUCTION,5
807,"From the moment in 1979 when Mrs Thatcher swept to power on a wave of uncollected garbage following the ‘winter of discontent’, her radical assault on social democracy and the welfare state was to be a continuing theme of the politics of the 1980s.",5
808,"In her famed speech on election night 1987, as she rallied her party troops on the steps of Party Headquarters not to rest on their laurels but to continue the fight (they were to be allowed one night of ‘marvellous partying’ but must start back the next day with renewed vigour), she announced that ‘we've got a big job to do in some of those inner cities…and politically, we've got to get back in there — we want to win those too’.",5
809,The connection between her public policies and the political arithmetic was precise and clear.,5
810,"In this chapter, I shall argue that the concept ‘inner city’ is a fundamentally ideological category.",5
811,"Although it is often presented as a scientific term, relating to features of urban development, its use is better understood as part of an ideological set which has been borrowed from the United States.",5
812,The use of the very term is therefore questionable.,5
813,"As used in politics and social policy in contemporary Britain, the concept ‘inner city’ is part of a move to a more conservative and punitive set of social practices and attitudes.",5
814,THE ‘INNER CITY’,5
815,The ‘inner city’ is a representation which serves as a focus for politics and policy.,5
816,"It is a public issue which represents a  constellation of social worries, to do with urban poverty, squalor, ill-health, deprivation, decay, crime, social disintegration, and social polarization.",5
817,The core issue is that of .,5
818,Poverty has been a continuing problem in post-war Britain.,5
819,Its size and shape have varied and the names used to describe it have varied.,5
820,What we have seen in the 1980s is a process by which poverty has been redefined as to do with the ‘inner city’.,5
821,"This involves an association of poverty with crime and violence, and with decay and backwardness.",5
822,The redefinition of poverty as urban poverty and as a problem of the inner city reflects also a change in perceptions of appropriate policy responses.,5
823,"Specifically, the concentration on the spatial dimension, the grounded location of poverty in certain areas, arose when attempts were being made to restrict the scope of public policy and the extent of public expenditure, to limit its focus to targeted areas.",5
824,"However, reality intrudes on such constructions, as indicated by the gradual widening of the category ‘inner city’ to refer also to ‘outer estates’and then to whole cities, like Bradford; in some cases it is even used as a code for whole regions of deprivation that other metaphor, the North-South divide.",5
825,The battle of ideas is about the very categories to be used in policy debate.,5
826,"Those who prefer limited, selective superficial policies exert pressure to restrict the scope of the categories.",5
827,"Those arguing for more fundamental change, tackling the merely the of social distress, utilize categories embracing wider sections of society, extending from the still limited concept of the ‘bottom third’ to wider notions of the ‘public’and ‘citizens’.",5
828,This chapter has a double focus.,5
829,It aims to show that closely related to the objective of resurrecting conservative social policies is a political method which involves an attempt to change Britain's political landscape.,5
830,"Mrs Thatcher's expressed aim was to rid the country of socialism forever, and part of this involved destroying the Labour party's local government base.",5
831,"In the 1980s, Labour local authorities had emerged as defenders of the poor and of public services.",5
832,"The third term reforms to local government, the ‘inner-city’ policies, were much less about doing good for the  poor and arresting decline and decay than about undermining Labour's power bases.",5
833,"The flagship reform, the poll tax, and the related flotilla of changes affecting privatization and contracting-out, education, housing and social services, specific ‘inner-city initiatives’, were designed to change the political structure and quite precisely to replace local democracy by the ‘market’.",5
834,The explicitly anti-democratic nature of the radical Right project was put succinctly in an Institute of Economic Affairs pamphlet:,5
835,it is clear that the machinery of representative parliamentary democracy has so far proved unsuitable as the mechanism for translating personal preferences into day-to-day practice.,5
836,Profoundly disturbing questions must be raised about the imperfections or obstacles in the representative political process that frustrate the wishes of the sovereign populace it is ostensibly designed to represent.,5
837,"(Harris and Seldon, 1987, p. 64)",5
838,"propose ways in which representative democracy could be strengthened and improved, these authors concluded: ‘the weight of the evidence is that a vote is much less effective than purchasing power…the market is potentially more democratic than the state’(p. 65).",5
839,DIVIDED BRITAIN: THE ASSAULT ON THE WELFARE STATE,5
840,"Britain has become an increasingly divided kingdom under Mrs Thatcher: the years 1979–87 witnessed major changes in Britain's electoral geography, reflecting growing socio-economic polarization — the divide between the relatively prosperous and the relatively deprived areas widened (Walker and Walker, 1987).",5
841,"Johnston and his colleagues (1988, pp. 325–7) have argued that",5
842,this polarisation of the country and its potential political consequences was recognised by the Conservative Government almost certainly well before the results of the 1987 general election were known…the development of policies to tackle the economic run-down and social deprivation of inner city areas was identified as a major thrust for the new government and many new initiatives were conceived in the first weeks of the new Parliament.,5
843,"To a large extent, these continued and crystallised earlier attempts to tackle similar problems…",5
844,"The nature of those policies with their emphases on private sector developments, home ownership and small businesses, suggests that the Government is seeking to produce electoral change by introducing traditional Conservative supporters to areas where the party has been very weak — as, , in many of the residential developments in London's Docklands.",5
845,"Mrs Thatcher's identification of the ‘inner cities’ as the focus of her third term's agenda was not therefore a new conversion to the need to do something about urban poverty, squalor, and alienation.",5
846,"Rather it was one more step in the approach to the reform of both local government and the politics and values of British society, which has been followed through consistently and vigorously throughout the 1980s.",5
847,"For the third term, the key policy areas, which would tackle the ‘really big job’ of the ‘inner cities’, were named as the policies for local government, education, and housing.",5
848,"Much of the right-wing discussion of policies for inner cities has been framed the attack was solely on two forms of ‘extremists’: one, the ‘Loony Left’ and the other, disorderly, criminal elements fomenting riots and social disorder.",5
849,"But the Thatcherite counter-revolution is much more all-encompassing: it is an assault on social democracy and all that that term entails, just as much if not more so than on simply ‘taking out’ pockets of resistance in specific local areas.",5
850,Key state agencies in the social democratic arrangements identified for attack were local authorities.,5
851,TACKLING THE TOWN HALLS,5
852,"The programme of reforms to local government, to reduce the power and status of local authorities, is part of a planned programme which, it is intended, will stretch into the 1990s.",5
853,Because some reforms are hidden from public view over the horizon does not mean that they have not been thought out and designed.,5
854,"As we move along the road, they will come into sight.",5
855,"Mrs Thatcher herself supported this reading: ‘I'm here because I believe in things — because I'm always thinking forward’(speaking on , 25 January 1988).",5
856,The Bradford model represents Thatcherism in action in the ‘inner city’.,5
857,"(Bradford as a whole was frequently described as an ‘inner city’ in news broadcasts in 1988, demonstrating clearly that the term signified ‘poverty and decline’a specific area in a city.)",5
858,"Shortly after the Tories won control of the council in September 1988, almost £6 million of cuts in local authority expenditure were announced.",5
859,"The Leader of the Council, Eric Pickles, speaking at the Tory Conference in 1988, had promised that these reforms would place the customer first and that Labour would be swept from control of the cities and Town Halls.",5
860,"In this constellation, the Right identifies housing particular significance.",5
861,"The long period of domination by municipal socialism is said to have produced a dependence on the local authority, especially through provision of council housing.",5
862,Low rents are seen as a form of bribery of the electorate.,5
863,And this special culture is thought to be found in a particularly acute and virulent form in Scotland and in some parts of the North of England.,5
864,Michael Heseltine was the main spokesman of the Conservative approach to the inner cities until his ministerial career was  abruptly interrupted by the Westland affair in 1986.,5
865,"He has remarked on the apparent fact that the ‘Loony Left’ were ‘increasingly to be found in the more deprived and distressed parts of our country’(Heseltine, 1987, p. 131).",5
866,"The Government had, he said, four choices.",5
867,They could let conditions worsen; or they could move power back to national government; or they could re-organise the electoral boundaries the irresponsible Left loses its tight inner urban constituencies; or they could push power out beyond local government and into the hands of the people whom it is elected to serve.,5
868,(p. 132).,5
869,"In practice, all four of these options have been pursued by the Thatcher administrations.",5
870,But it was the fourth option which the Tories emphasized in their rhetoric.,5
871,Local authorities would be encouraged to see themselves primarily as ‘service-providers’.,5
872,"Once this was conceded, the next step would be to move to their becoming semi-independent public bodies (much the same might happen to hospitals and other public services), with the ‘freedom to manage’ without regard to political pressure from local electors or ‘vested interests’(trade unions and professionals) and the freedom to cut labour costs (the main item in service budgets) by paying people only what it was necessary to pay them in that local market.",5
873,"National pay settlements and negotiating arrangements  hinder that process which would be improved, they argue, by ‘flexibility’ in wage-rates and local pay bargaining.",5
874,"The of the enterprise culture and the shape of are thus integrally related, two sides of the same coin.",5
875,And such changes mark a decisive shift local democracy.,5
876,INSTITUTIONAL REFORM AND SOCIAL ENGINEERING,5
877,"Two developments — opposition to central government policies by Labour local councils, and urban riots — forced the Government to develop policies for the ‘inner cities’(Heseltine, 1987).",5
878,That riots and local socialism were both found in the most acutely stressed parts of the country is no accident.,5
879,Each was a form of opposition to the direction and effects of government policy and protest at economic changes.,5
880,Hence the Tory Government's need to try to destroy such opposition.,5
881,"This could be done by  beating down, as in the assertion of dominance over local authorities.",5
882,Or it could be done through fragmentation.,5
883,"Fragmentation takes place where blocks of low-income poor housing and their associated populations are broken up and dispersed, either through deliberate slum clearance and dispersal of population, as in the late nineteenth century (Stedman Jones, 1971); or by the decentralizing effects of the policies of earlier post-war years, overspill outer estates and new towns; or through the later processes of ‘gentrification’(Glass, 1964)— a term first used by Ruth Glass but popularized in the late 1970s — i.e. the emergence of new wealthy areas as in Islington or Docklands and the displacement of the poorer local population, likely to be further encouraged by the impact of the poll tax.",5
884,"Both the assertion of central authority and the fragmentation of local social structures and economics are integral to the overall desire to use power to restructure social arrangements in such a way that certain interests are favoured over others, to reward supporters,to maintain these arrangements by using social institutions to entrench an alternative set of ideas, those of the ‘enterprise culture’.",5
885,"The Thatcherite counter-revolution should be seen, then, as consisting of a number of interrelated policies designed to restructure taxation, restructure public expenditure, reshape the welfare services, and curb the power of professionals, trade unions, and local authorities.",5
886,These are closely interrelated and the Government's plans for the ‘inner cities’ cannot be understood unless seen as part of this overall enterprise.,5
887,Thatcherism's social engineering — just as much social engineering as that of the Fabians or the very different local socialists they oppose — aims to ‘temper expectations’.,5
888,"The post-war boom's revolution of rising expectations is said to have fostered an insatiable appetite for more, without concern for the question of ‘who pays?’",5
889,Thatcherism is the revolt of the haves against the demands of the .,5
890,"Mrs Thatcher, speaking on (25 January 1988), said that her constituency is that of those who are working ‘for an increased standard of living for their own families’(not, we should note, for others).",5
891,"She receives more complaints, she said, from those who are but feel they  would be as on supplementary benefit; her aim is to increase the gap between those who are working and the non-working.",5
892,An interesting aspect of any ‘counter-revolution’ is that it takes the terms of the ‘revolution’and turns them to its own purposes.,5
893,"As Arno Mayer (1971, p. 45) commented, ‘by reflex, the counter-revolution borrows its central ideas, objectives, styles and methods from the revolution’.",5
894,"Thus ideas and principles are taken over, redefined, and reapplied to structure and manage discontent and political rebellion.",5
895,"Key words self-help, accountability, responsibility, hard work, thrift — many central to the tradition of the English working classes and trade unions — have been appropriated and presented as specifically Conservative and in some way under threat from socialism and collective action.",5
896,So the Thatcherite counter-revolution has redefined the idea of justice.,5
897,"John Redwood, Head of the Prime Minister's Policy Unit in 1983–5, now a Conservative MP, sees two different kinds of justice: protection for the poor; and that all who enjoy services should pay (speaking on , 11 October 1987).",5
898,"The poll tax, he said, is central to change and to improving the inner cities.",5
899,Enterprise has been driven away by high business rates and high domestic rates.,5
900,"Enterprising people, in Thatcherism's view, are those who create new jobs.",5
901,"These are the highly successful, who must be encouraged to stay and to do well for they are the motor that pulls the rest up; they create prosperity and employ other people.",5
902,"Part of the drive to improve inner cities is deliberately to reward success, increase the gap between the working and the non-working, retain business and talented and successful people in these areas, and charge those who use services the economic cost of these services, if they don't like the price they will be encouraged to move out to areas where ‘the price is right’.",5
903,This is called ‘consumer choice’ and it also opens up the possibility of charging for more services.,5
904,"The effect on the demography of the inner cities could be dramatic, as migration into and inner cities is in any case already high.",5
905,"Since housing is also crucial to mobility, the break-up of local authority control of low-income estates is also part of the package of reforms.",5
906,"Reports that the numbers registering on the electoral rolls are falling (, 11 October 1987; the , 23 February 1988, p. 6) indicate that the political arithmetic will also play its part.",5
907,"If some of those who resist and resent the imposition, opt the electoral system (and the calculation is that these will be those who are thought, either now or in the future, likely to benefit from the present array of public services), while others are more inclined to vote at local elections for a party which offers to cut and reorganize services, the electoral outcome would be dramatic.",5
908,"Michael Howard, then a Minister at the Department of the Environment, reported an opinion poll as having found that one-quarter of people who had not previously voted in local elections intended to vote in future as a result of the community charge (interview on , 21 February 1988).",5
909,"Quite how they will choose to vote is less certain, however, as the poll tax becomes labelled ‘a Tory tax’ and as environmental issues and collapsing public services assume a higher priority.",5
910,Another concept which has been taken over and reinterpreted is that of ‘decentralization’.,5
911,"One argument against the Government's third term agenda for local government and the public services has been that, by undermining local authorities, they are increasingly centralizing decision-taking.",5
912,"On the contrary, argue the Thatcherites, we are ‘putting power further away’, to parents through the education reforms.",5
913,"With the opting-out opportunity, schools will have greater responsibility and liberty than under local authorities.",5
914,", capital is said to have been spread among the people.",5
915,FROM ENTITLEMENT TO OBLIGATION,5
916,The new enlightenment's assault on social democracy has focused particularly on the concept of ‘dependency’.,5
917,"Dependence on bureaucracies (local authorities, the NHS, the social security system) is said to present people with a lack of control over their own lives, to damage the spirit of independence.",5
918,"The sole supporters or the ‘social democratic’ welfare state are, so the argument goes, the publicly employed educated classes, whose careers are linked to the state.",5
919,"Removing the supports of these state agencies — the welfare net, subsidized public services — would face people with a ‘reality test’: that if you don't sweep floors eight hours a day, you won't have any money to live on.",5
920,Young people are thought to have imbibed this dependency culture to an extent not found in their parents and grandparents — a product of the high rates of social expenditure of the 1960s and 70s.,5
921,"To effect a new social discipline, a new relationship is being established between the state and its subjects: society, that is the government, plays the role of the strict disciplinarian father; the people ate their children who have to be taught to mend their ways.",5
922,"John Moore, then Social Services Secretary, set this out explicitly in a key speech in autumn 1987, when he argued the need to move from social protection towards attacking dependency.",5
923,"In doing this, he said, ‘we are following the oldest pattern of behaviour known to man: the way parents raise their children.",5
924,"The aim of all parents is to teach their child to become an independent, self-reliant adult, able to participate in life and gain satisfaction.",5
925,This should be society's aim for all its citizens too.’,5
926,A clearer statement of the top-down direction of the people by government would be hard to find.,5
927,It demonstrates the emphasis on moral regulation and discipline which distinguishes the conservative from the liberal phases of Thatcherism.,5
928,"The American writer Charles Murray, one of Mr Moore's mentors, has justified moves the language of entitlement to the language of obligation by reference to something he calls ‘popular wisdom’.",5
929,"This he defines as characterized by ‘hostility towards welfare (it makes people lazy), toward lenient judges (they encourage crime), and toward socially conscious schools…",5
930,"The popular wisdom disapproves of favoritism for blacks and of too many written-in rights for minorities of all sorts’(Murray, 1984, p. 146).",5
931,John Moore continued his ‘assault on dependency’ in 1989 by arguing that real poverty has already been abolished in modern Britain.,5
932,Very few are really poor any more.,5
933,"To make this case, he defined poverty in ‘the old absolute sense of hunger and want’ or as ‘starving children and squalid slums’.",5
934,"By defining poverty as starvation and destitution, he was able to claim that not many people in Britain are poor and that those who argue the case for improvements to welfare provision, ‘the poverty lobby and the media’, are really intent on furthering their socialist aims through calling Western material capitalism a failure.",5
935,"Where others might see a more complex situation with a conceptual continuum between starvation, hunger, destitution, poverty (want), and inequality, Moore abolishes poverty by dividing it up between the two extremes of the continuum, also at the same time neatly side-stepping discussion of the visible increase in begging, destitution, and homelessness in major British cities.",5
936,"The sub-text, or hidden message, of Moore's attack on the poverty lobby is an attack on the poor themselves, part of the move to a harsher, conservative approach to social policy.",5
937,The poor are in reality simply experiencing the effects of inequality and can indeed be blamed for their condition.,5
938,"‘It is hard to believe that poverty stalks the land when even the poorest fifth of families with children spend nearly a tenth of their income on alcohol and tobacco’, was Mr Moore's dismissive conclusion.",5
939,"Such new social engineering is based on a specific form of behaviourist psychology — rewards and punishments directed at teach them that actions have consequences, that failures or mistakes are punished and not rewarded, behaviour changes.",5
940,This stress on merely responsibility ignores the reality of the interrelatedness of human life.,5
941,No consideration is given to the fact that actually — that one person's effort may bring reward to someone else; that one person's mistake can bring disaster to another.,5
942,The aim of the Thatcherite reforms to the public services is said to be to give consumers the power to go elsewhere if they are not satisfied.,5
943,"This policy is limited, however, in two crucial ways: first, that such ‘choice’ in effect reduces to the ability to pay, and ability to pay has been profoundly affected by other policies which have increased the differences among groups income and wealth; and secondly, that many public services must be provided in the local area if they are to be of real value and if other costs, not only financial, are not to be incurred, , in travelling or moving residence to receive them.",5
944,", proposals those to base service provision on charges or vouchers are impractical and tend only to  increase the differences between the services available in different areas and to shift the costs from the more visible budgets of the services to the less visible ones of the individual, relatively powerless consumer: either their pockets or their time and energy will be hit.",5
945,"As we have seen, the language of this welfare revolution is American, much of it popularized by writers like Charles Murray (1984).",5
946,The aim to move the language of to the language of is very different from the language of freedom and liberty which dominated the earlier phases of Thatcherism.,5
947,"As the terms accountability and democracy were redefined in the poll tax debates, so the concepts of ‘justice’ and ‘active citizenship’have been redefined in the debates about public services.",5
948,The Thatcherite assault on the welfare state involves two key aspects: lowering expectations and imposing work discipline.,5
949,"The object of the ‘training schemes’ being promoted as part of the inner-city package is to drive down wages, for without reducing wages there will be in job creation.",5
950,The creation of the enterprise culture in deprived areas of the North and the ‘inner cities’ is fundamentally about the creation of jobs at lower wages than were previously viewed as acceptable reducing entitlement to benefit and levels of benefit to increase the incentive to take on these jobs.,5
951,The end of entitlement is perhaps best demonstrated by the introduction of the Social Fund in the social security reforms of 1988.,5
952,"The Social Fund replaced the previous system of additional and urgent needs allowances and grants, which had been an area of supplementary benefit responsive to demand and welfare rights pressure.",5
953,"The solution to the complexities of the system and the growing complexity of case law adjudication was to abolish the notion of additional allowances completely, replacing them with loans from a limited budget and no right to independent appeal.",5
954,This signified a ‘campaign against the benefit culture’.,5
955,Benefits would go only to those in ‘genuine need’ so as not to ‘featherbed’the rest.,5
956,A distinction would be made between the deserving and the undeserving poor.,5
957,"The main aim of these reforms was to meet need precisely and in a neat, targeted  form.",5
958,"Rather it was precisely to change attitudes, to stress individual responsibility — you're on your own, don't expect any help from us — and to reduce the state's obligations.",5
959,THE BATTLE OF IDEAS,5
960,"‘The welfare state is Britain's proudest achievement and the biggest man-made disaster’, Sir John Hoskyns has written.",5
961,(He is another former Head of the Prime Minister's policy Unit and a key figure in the Institute of Directors.),5
962,"In a series of articles in to celebrate Mrs Thatcher's ten years as leader (11, 12, and 13 February 1985) he wrote that she had inherited ‘forty years of muddled policy’.",5
963,"The first stage of the attack on the ‘muddled policy’ involved reducing the power of the trade unions, especially the public sector unions, who were thought to dominate the welfare state itself.",5
964,"Having cowed the trade unions, we can see that the next step was to take on the local authorities and the poor.",5
965,"Next in line for the 1990s are child benefit, pensions, and the NHS.",5
966,"By the year 2000, little will remain of the 1940s social legislation, assumed by Beveridge.",5
967,Beveridge's Report was based on three guiding principles: the second of these was that:,5
968,the organization of social insurance should be treated as .,5
969,Social insurance fully developed may provide income security: it is an attack upon Want.,5
970,But Want is one only of five giants on the road of reconstruction and in some ways the easiest to attack.,5
971,"The others are Disease, Ignorance, Squalor and Idleness'.",5
972,"(Beveridge, 1942, para. 8, my emphasis)",5
973,"Thus Beveridge had assumed that the elimination of poverty was integrally linked to policies for health, education, housing and town planning, and full employment.",5
974,"Under Thatcherism, full employment commitments, family allowances, the NHS, town planning, council housing, education, social security, all will have been radically reformed.",5
975,"The battle of politics and ideas which focuses on the inner city represents a conflict between sets of interests and values which have a long history, dating from the 1830s and the New Poor Law of 1834.",5
976,"These are conflicts between democratic and  anti-democratic, socialist and anti-socialist, egalitarian and anti-egalitarian ideas.",5
977,The ideas of the radical Right are not new.,5
978,They go back a long way.,5
979,"They are old ideas stated in new form, in new language.",5
980,"In all the post-war years, both currents have been present.",5
981,What changed was the party political situation: the seizure of power by the radical Right in the Conservative party and thence in government.,5
982,", Ian Macleod and Enoch Powell (1952) had argued:",5
983,"redistribution is a characteristic of the social services, the general presumption must be that they will be rendered only on evidence of need, i.e. of financial inability to provide each particular service one's own or one's family's resources.",5
984,"Otherwise the process is a wasteful and purposeless collection and issue of resources, which leaves people in the enjoyment of the same facilities as before.",5
985,"And Geoffrey Howe (1961) argued that ‘over the whole field of social policy, the firm aim should be a reduction in the role of the state’.",5
986,These ideas were given a great push forward by the increasing impact of American thinking on British social policy from the late 1960s onward.,5
987,"The collapse of thinking about social policy in Britain, a result largely of the failure of the Labour party to develop new policies and not to defend adequately basic principles and institutions, created a vacuum into which right-wing ideas flooded.",5
988,"It was easier for the Thatcherites to attack the welfare state successfully because its principles and institutions had not been adequately defended, as Dorothy Wedderburn and others were warning as early as 1964 (Wedderburn, 1965).",5
989,"The slippage of support for universalism, equality, and public services was illustrated in comments made by Roy Jenkins.",5
990,"Writing in 1959 and Peter Townsend's calculation that a fifth of the population had not shared in the general improvement in living standards since the war, Roy Jenkins argued:",5
991,"Any believer in social justice, or indeed any believer in a civilised society, must surely give a high priority to providing such an improvement.",5
992,"Some, including Mr Townsend himself, would give it an absolute priority.",5
993,They would deny the right of those whose standard of living is already at or above the average to any further improvement until the  submerged fifth had been given more or less equivalent benefits.,5
994,.,5
995,Neither the economic policy of a nation nor the political programme of a party is likely to achieve a successful dynamism if it is based solely upon the assistance of lame ducks.,5
996,"(Jenkins, 1959, pp. 56–7, my emphasis)",5
997,Thus even in 1959 advocacy of equality was cast as extremism.,5
998,the need for incentives was accepted if economic growth was to be attained.,5
999,And any chance of winning an election on proposals for social justice was ‘realistically’ denied.,5
1000,"It is important to stress that while there is within right-wing attacks on the welfare state a concentration on shifting culture and attitudes, with the increasing emphasis on ‘business’ and ‘enterprise’, on managing tight budgets and devolving responsibility for effecting cuts to lower levels, the intentions are determinedly economic.",5
1001,Ideology provides the justification and politics the means for shifts in economic outcomes — redistribution of income and wealth some sectors and groups towards others.,5
1002,This shift requires crucially a lowering of labour-costs and restructuring of the labour market.,5
1003,Social discipline is wanted not just for itself but for these ends.,5
1004,"Much of what happened with the ascendency of the radical Right in British politics was predicted in one prescient article (Leonard, 1979).",5
1005,"What is interesting, however, is that it has taken over ten years to bring about the changes Leonard anticipated.",5
1006,This is important and tells us two things.,5
1007,"First, that the radical Right's assault has been carefully managed; the step by step approach was brilliantly conceived and managed by diligent and unerring control from the centre; secondly, that the speed of its success has varied in different areas of public provision, which tells us much about the role of resistances, resistances built on organized opposition within the public services.",5
1008,"In the areas most closely concerned with the inner city, opposition from local authorities has been crucial.",5
1009,RECENT POLICIES ON THE INNER CITIES,5
1010,"Conservative policy on the inner cities has diverged in some ways from the earlier policies of the 1970s, especially in shifting  social and environmental programmes towards an emphasis on economic and enterprise-generating ones.",5
1011,"In other ways, however, there is a continuity in these policies, especially inner-city and urban initiatives specifically target defined spatial areas and direct resources deliberately towards them through special schemes.",5
1012,"The assumptions lying behind such targeted programmes are that the ‘problem’ is a bounded one, concerned with ‘pockets of poverty or deprivation’, restricted areas of decay, which can be remedied through relatively limited expenditure and precise targeting of funds and activities to ‘special’, different, difficult problems, limited problems which remain to be rooted out, while the rest of the system is assumed to be functioning well and on course for prosperity and harmony.",5
1013,", inner cities are perceived as ‘deviant communities’, areas which need to be turned around and brought back into the mainstream, a mainstream that requires little or no restructuring or reform.",5
1014,"This shift in policy from universalism towards selectivism and area targeting was criticized as early is 1976 by Peter Townsend, who was quick to note its implications:",5
1015,The perception that the ills of society are relatively more prevalent in some areas than others has innocent and fairly obvious origins…,5
1016,But then material and environmental deficiencies become heavily associated in the public mind with other socially perceived problems.,5
1017,"For social reasons, both the degree of concentration of certain acknowledged problems and the extent to which they can be explained by internal processes of self-generation rather externally imposed processes may be grossly exaggerated.",5
1018,"(Townsend, 1976, p. 168)",5
1019,"He foresaw the dangerous drift in urban policy, which began under a Labour government, towards beliefs in contamination, self-generation of problems, individualistic explanations for poverty, pathologizing of areas and their populations.",5
1020,These perceptions were encouraged by policies which assumed that problems of urban deprivation had their origins in the characteristics of local populations and that these could be resolved simply by better co-ordination of the social services and encouragement of citizen involvement and community self-help.,5
1021,THE ‘URBAN UNDERCLASS’,5
1022,"A key feature of this situation is the extent to which public policy itself acts to create an ‘underclass’ of excluded poor, who are compressed into densely populated, poorly served physical spaces, crowded estates, and ‘inner cities’.",5
1023,"This also implies, as recognized by the community development activists of the 1970s and their inheritors the ‘local socialists’, that poverty is a political condition as much if not more than a social or economic one.",5
1024,"The powerlessness of the poor, their inability to influence the distribution of life-chances and rewards, helps to explain their poverty (Miliband, 1974; MacGregor, 1981).",5
1025,"Some political activists concluded from this that what was needed was to ‘empower the poor’, encourage their civic and political participation as a way to redress the balance, give them the strength to organize in such a way as to make effective claims on society, to receive those citizen's rights to which they were said to be entitled.",5
1026,"Much welfare rights activity and anti-poverty campaigns of local authorities, anti-racist, anti-sexist equal opportunities policies, were based on this analysis.",5
1027,", the counter-revolution has taken over the key concepts of this approach and turned them on their head.",5
1028,"The ‘enabling state’ and the concept of empowering people have been interpreted as encouraging more individual consumer choice and limited, voluntary self-help welfare activity and ‘community care’(Thatcher, 1985; Ridley, 1988).",5
1029,"The perceptions of the ‘inner city’ and of the ‘underclass’which inform government circles today are drawn from the United States, whose cities offer a terrifying picture of our future if we continue to move down the road to a residual, extremely selectivist welfare system.",5
1030,These perceptions emphasize the pathology of the victims themselves and the pathological influences found in certain areas.,5
1031,"Fear about a drugs epidemic fuelled this alarm (MacGregor, 1989).",5
1032,"‘We have seen the future and it is frightening’, said Robin Corbett MP returning from a visit to New York's Lower East Side with the Home Affairs Select Committee in 1985.",5
1033,"The picture was sketched by John Banham (1988, p. 23), Director-General of the CBI, describing Lawndale on the south side of Chicago.",5
1034,"This, he said,",5
1035,represents a future to be avoided at almost any cost.,5
1036,"There, a combination of poor housing and education, high crime rates, much of it drug-related, large-scale immigration and associated racial tensions, an exodus of jobs and the more well-off to the suburbs, high youth unemployment and welfare dependency and the break-up of traditional family structures have served to create what some commentators in the United States have described as an ‘urban underclass’.",5
1037,John Banham's understanding of the term ‘underclass’ derives from his days as a Director-General at the Audit Commission.,5
1038,"It reiterates an orthodoxy whose source can be traced to one specific article (Lemann, 1986).",5
1039,"This perception found expression also in an important Audit Commission Occasional Paper (Audit Commission, 1987) from which Banham's statement quotes and which is itself a direct repetition of Lemann's views.",5
1040,The paper set out in diagrammatic form a view of the factors causing an urban underclass (see Figure 4. 1).,5
1041,"At the centre of the conception is high youth unemployment which, it is assumed, in the case of males leads to crime and trouble with the police; in the case of females it leads to single-parent families.",5
1042,"Single-parent families, that is , are blamed for continuing this process, producing a culture of dependency and poverty in that their children are said to grow up with poor interpersonal skills, low educational achievement, and lack of marketable skills.",5
1043,Recent US research and policy have focused on ‘mothers’.,5
1044,Welfare is seen as a drug of but studies of long-term welfare recipients have found that only one in five daughters of dependent mothers themselves become dependent.,5
1045,"Furthermore, half of all mothers on welfare come off it within two years (Daly, 1989).",5
1046,"However, superficial reading of research findings, combined with prejudice, has led to a growing stress on workfare in the United States where mothers, whose children may be as young as six months in some States, could be forced to accept training or low-paid work even where the child care support services are inadequate.",5
1047,The harshly punitive impact of the new   social conservatism on these women and their children contrasts with right-wing rhetoric expressing concern for the family.,5
1048,"These views are being borrowed by right-wingers in Britain (Redwood, 1989).",5
1049,The social historian John Macnicol (1988) has criticized the ‘pursuit of the underclass’ which characterized the 1970s and 1980s.,5
1050,"He pinpoints the beginnings of the contemporary resurgence of this theme as Sir Keith Joseph's speech to the pre-School Playgroups Association on 29 June 1972, when he was Secretary of State for Social Services.",5
1051,Macnicol shows that the roots of these views lie deeper and can be found in the social debates of the past one hundred years.,5
1052,Investigations of a hereditary or hard-core social problem group have always been crucial in conservative social reformist strategies.,5
1053,"Joseph had mused: ‘perhaps there is at work here a process, apparent in many situations but imperfectly understood, by which problems reproduced themselves from generation to generation’(Joseph, 1972).",5
1054,"The focus on the pattern of births among the very poor, a feature of the American concept of the underclass, one which prioritizes ‘single-parent female headed households’ as major issues (blaming the mothers), appeared explicitly in Joseph's 1974 Birmingham speech when he maintained that, because an excess of births was apparently occurring in mothers of social class V, ‘the balance of our population, our human stock, is threatened’.",5
1055,"Birth control might help to prevent the excess production of ‘problem children, the future unmarried mothers, delinquents, denizens of our Borstals, subnormal educational establishments, prisons, hostels for drifters’.",5
1056,"Extensive research failed to support the cycle of deprivation thesis but the stereotype lived on, and grew to more prominence with the dominance of the right wing in the Conservative party and thence in British society and politics: Keith Joseph was an early leading figure in this faction within the party.",5
1057,"The apparent existence of an economically unproductive residuum of social outcasts has been traced as a feature of social investigation and social policy by, among others, Stedman Jones (1971) and John Macnicol (1988).",5
1058,The words used — the labels — have varied over time: residuum; social problem group; hard-core; problem families; the culture of poverty; alienation; hereditary poverty; the inadequate poor; the urban underclass.,5
1059,The search for personal inadequacy and behavioural defects has been the key focus of such research and policy.,5
1060,"Macnicol argues that ‘in its periodic reconstruction, the underclass concept has tended to consist of five elements’:",5
1061,1.,5
1062,"an artificial ‘administrative definition relating to contacts with particular institutions of the state and welfare agencies, social workers, the police etc.’;",5
1063,2.,5
1064,"the separate question of inter-generational transmission, through either heredity or socialization;",5
1065,3.,5
1066,"identification of particular behavioural traits as antisocial, ignoring others;",5
1067,4.,5
1068,"stress on resource allocation issues, emphasizing high demand for services by defined categories of users; and",5
1069,5.,5
1070,"‘it tends to be supported by those who wish to constrain the redistributive potential of state welfare and thus it has always been part of a broader conservative view of the aetiology of social problems and their correct solutions’(Macnicol, 1988, p. 316).",5
1071,"The centrality of the ‘family’ in these conservative perceptions, and the double-edged nature of the disciplines advocated to deal with the problem, were illustrated in an editorial in the (Europe) of 17 January 1989.",5
1072,"Entitled , this explained the split between the successful, socially mobile blacks and the rest thus:",5
1073,the key to the difference…lies in the family — a truth Daniel Patrick Moynihan was pilloried for stating a few years before Martin Luther King's assassination.,5
1074,"In the past week, it happens, we have heard intelligent and well-meaning whites talking in apocalyptic terms about the problem of the black underclass — that it can only be solved by draconian measures of enshrining abortion or taking children mothers.",5
1075,"this, argued the :",5
1076,"the solution to the underclass lies in stricter enforcement of the criminal laws, in giving tenants a stake and a say in public housing, in educational innovation opposed by teachers' unions, in changing welfare laws a baby is not a ticket for an apartment separate from mom's.",5
1077,"Much of the problem of the underclass, we continue to believe, arises from perverse incentives rooted in misguided paternalism.",5
1078,"This explanation of urban poverty ‘perverse incentives’ is being picked up by the right wing in Britain and used as the basis for proposals for new policies and regulations regarding unemployment benefit, income support, and housing entitlement as they apply to lone mothers.",5
1079,"In the same week in which the editorial appeared, it was announced in Britain that an extensive study of lone parents' reliance on social security would be carried out after comments from Ministers that the state is having to foot the bill for the so-called dependency culture (, 18 January 1989, p. 3).",5
1080,"Mr John Moore, then Social Security Secretary, had spoken of a young woman in his constituency who obtained special benefit and a council flat by becoming pregnant.",5
1081,He had said that the Government needed to be ‘wary of providing incentives to obtain a particular benefit which can erode a sense of personal responsibility and adversely affect behaviour’.,5
1082,"Similarly, discussions are developing on how to limit the housing provided for single mothers and their children to very low standard institutional care, ‘to discourage the others,.",5
1083,BLAMING AND EXPELLING THE VICTIM,5
1084,"While disputing the definition of an underclass composed of recalcitrant or wayward pathological individuals, it should be noted that current developments in public policy, especially the poll tax registration and payment procedures, are encouraging the formation of an ‘underclass’ in the sense of a section of society which does not participate even formally in society, participate fully as citizens.",5
1085,"Townsend's most important definition of poverty which emphasizes that lack of money leads to in  inability to join in fully in social life, producing in exclusion of individuals and social groups from ordinary life, focuses crucially on the role of lack of participation and powerlessness in the social construction of the ‘poor’.",5
1086,"Some features of public policy may add to this informal exclusion and outcast status by encouraging people to opt out completely even from formal status as a citizen, thus losing all civic rights.",5
1087,"The poll tax is crucial here (MacGregor, 1988).",5
1088,"The pressures to evade the tax — a new imposition bearing particularly hard on poor people in deprived, high spending areas — will encourage some people to disappear from all public record and perhaps to keep on the move to avoid detection.",5
1089,Recent changes in social security regulations add to this.,5
1090,"Shelter estimated that 25,000 to 40,000 young people slept out in the open in Central London in 1987.",5
1091,Others say the numbers increased in 1988.,5
1092,"The census of 1991 may be affected by these processes and since the census returns will form the basis of some resource-allocation calculations, severe underestimation of the needs of some areas may be the result.",5
1093,In the United States cities already have to argue for a notional amount to compensate for such under-recording: the same will probably have to happen in Britain.,5
1094,THE DEBATE IN THE UNITED STATES: SOCIAL DEMOCRACY'S ALTERNATIVE,5
1095,"In his book , William Julius Wilson avoided the simplistic banalities of writers like Murray and Lemann (Wilson, 1987).",5
1096,"He confronted the evidence on inner cities and, being a black social democratic scholar, dared to observe the clustering in ‘ghetto’ neighbourhoods of ‘socially isolated’blacks and Hispanics.",5
1097,"This is due, he argued, to decreasing employment opportunities with the shift from goods-producing to service-producing activities and the loss of 7 million unskilled jobs, and the undesirable concentration effects of this.",5
1098,"But this situation was not, he claimed, the result of personal inadequacy; it resulted from wider impersonal economic and demographic forces.",5
1099,The loss of employment opportunities led to a loss of ‘marriageable men’ in inner-city areas.,5
1100,"A key factor in the process, Wilson argued, was the collapse of in these neighbourhoods, a direct result of poverty and social isolation, which produces a continuing social disorganization.",5
1101,Wilson's work has been lauded by the centre-left in the United States and is an important reminder that not all Americans are Reaganites.,5
1102,But this brave attempt to ‘face facts’ contains problems.,5
1103,"The concept of social disorganization, , which has a long history in sociology, assumes its contrast to be with a ‘community’, a harmoniously well-organized and integrated society.",5
1104,"What we see, however, are forms of organization,institutional arrangements.",5
1105,"We may prefer arrangements based on institutions like the church and the shop but gangs and parties are also forms of social institution, not perhaps quite so easy to break down and displace as ‘disorganization, would imply.",5
1106,We may agree with much of Wilson's emphasis on the need for public policy that promotes programmes and increases employment and training opportunities .,5
1107,"However, his analysis has been criticized as ‘abominably sexist not to mention atavistic’(Reed, 1988).",5
1108,"The tangle of behaviours Wilson discusses consists of crime rates, teenage pregnancy, female heads of families, welfare dependency, and wedlock births.",5
1109,Clearly four of these are overlapping categories and focus on women specifically.,5
1110,To condemn this analysis as sexist is not however exact.,5
1111,"Young men and underclass men are also portrayed in disparaging terms in the book, the explanation for their behaviour (criminality, violence, drugs, hanging round pool halls, lick of responsibility for offspring) is placed at the door of external forces.",5
1112,"Rather, the analysis is pro-nuclear family and implicitly pro-patriarchy and favours a clear set of moral rules and values, which perhaps are ones of which many respectable working-class people, both black and white, Afro-American, European-American, and others, might approve.",5
1113,"But by focusing on a particular selection of empirical evidence, the book seems to shift  the blame from the poor and the underclass to women and to their lack of available, acceptable marriage partners.",5
1114,The implicit solution is a resurgence of the ‘normal’ nuclear family.,5
1115,"Whatever the support or not for these values, the book fails to recognize the wider changes that have gone on in the family and in gender relations, changes which may be quite separate in origin from the question of poverty, although they add to the poverty of women and children.",5
1116,Remedies for the poverty of single mothers and their families in an economy where the two-income family sets the norm in both the production and consumption systems would need to be more far reaching than those proposed by Wilson.,5
1117,"It is quite clear that the lone parent is greatly disadvantaged available resources, money especially, but also time and energy, compared to the two-parent or three-generation family, and she and her children suffer this.",5
1118,"But other factors cross-cut and a given lone-parent family may still be better off than if they were in a two-parent household characterized by vindictiveness, meanness, or violence (Pahl, 1985).",5
1119,"Importantly, the politics behind the ‘impersonal, economic and demographic forces at work in British and American cities need to be brought out.",5
1120,The transformation of postwar industrial cities was driven not by some abstract historical force but by a combination of private investment decision and state action.,5
1121,"This impetus was centred around an urban renewal policy that — explicitly segregationist policies in federal public housing — cut off minority communities, displaced large sections of these communities and concentrated them between expressways, office complexes, stadiums and civic centers.",5
1122,There lies the source of Wilson's ‘social isolation’.,5
1123,"(Reed, 1988, p. 169)",5
1124,"Wilson in the end fails to escape from ‘the nexus of moralistic ideology and patriarchal vision dressed up as social science,(ibid.), much as the writers reviewed by Macnicol failed to do.",5
1125,"However, his conception of the ‘underclass’, its causation and policy remedies, differs markedly from those of the far Right whose views have been so easily absorbed into British government and establishment thinking.",5
1126,CONCLUSION,5
1127,the single point that emerges from a close reading of the literature on the underclass and the inner city is that there is no valid need to identify the poor by their putative behaviour .,5
1128,"Many of the indicators chosen are suspect, as Macnicol has shown for earlier periods, they simply count contact with state agencies, and it is a commonplace observation that the poor are more likely to be social workers because they are poor (Becker, 1988); young drug-takers in inner cities are more visible than wealthy socialites but drug-taking and drinking stretch across social groups (O'Bryan, 1989; Plant, 1989); desertion of women by husbands and the choice to remain unmarried are not restricted to the poor; .",5
1129,All these ‘signs’ of ‘inadequacy’are nothing of the kind but are indicators of poverty and powerlessness.,5
1130,"Only measures of material social conditions, unemployment, income, housing conditions, density of population, can usefully serve to characterize the deprivation encountered by those forced to live in these circumstances.",5
1131,The ‘underclass’ is what the working poor become when they are not employed.,5
1132,"Once jobs arise and if they are paid for their labour, they become the workers again; sometimes they are just as poor but their class position has changed.",5
1133,"However, long-term unemployment and disconnection from the social relations of work and employment are bound to produce different patterns of social life, norms, and values and possibly despair and hopelessness.",5
1134,It may lead to a gap between the values of those most closely tied to the institutions of the labour movement and the unwaged.,5
1135,But this problem too is not confined to the gap between the ‘workers’ and the unemployed.,5
1136,"It affects the gap between unionized and non-unionized sectors, between men-dominated and women-dominated work-situations and areas of social life.",5
1137,These varieties are complex and changeable: at times of rapid social restructuring such changes are also more rapid.,5
1138,What is clear is that public policies that come from outside and are imposed on inner-city populations are often based on prejudice and ignorance.,5
1139,"What is needed is a change in the processes of decision-making policies are informed from below by the people involved, who  are the only ones who really know what life there is like and what people really want and are able to do.",5
1140,"In the dominant conceptions of inner-city public policy, breaking the cycle focuses on the issues of ‘welfare dependency’ and ‘youth unemployment’: it does not include far-reaching and fundamental reorganization of social and economic life and the redistribution of income, wealth, and life-chances.",5
1141,Hugh Stretton (1978) has provided four metaphors to characterize the city: the city as machine; as community; as a market place; and as a battle-ground.,5
1142,"In this chapter I have concentrated on the image of the inner city as a battle-ground — a battleground on which opposing forces, ideas, and values can be identified.",5
1143,The argument has been that the geography of poverty and the geography of voting are interconnected and thus party politics and public policies are interconnected too.,5
1144,"Attitudes to social problems and public policy and electoral strategies are closely intertwined, most effectively by the Thatcherites in their overall strategy of social engineering.",5
1145,"Their opponents have not been able to make the connections as effectively, either through working out a coherent ideology or through practice and organization.",5
1146,"Only municipal socialism offered any coherent alternative, but this was limited by its restriction to the local level; the balance of power went against it and it has now been thrown back.",5
1147,"Dominant perceptions of poverty in divided Britain as characterized by urban poverty, decay, and concentration in areas defined as ‘inner cities’ and inhabited by an ‘underclass’call forth increasingly punitive and extremely tight-fisted selectivist policy responses.",5
1148,"An alternative view sees the shape of poverty as reflecting the shape and condition of the wider society and requires more wide-ranging policy responses, especially those founded on universalist principles.",5
1149,"In a critical article written several years ago, Townsend concluded by reminding his readers what Tawney had written in 1913.",5
1150,": in the 1990s these words (their dated gender references) remain as relevant and as enlightening as in the 1970s and at the beginning of the century: the problem of poverty is  the condition of the normal man [and woman]in normal circumstances, neither better nor worse off than his [or her]neighbours, not of those whose failings qualify them to be the text for the moralist, and who are no more common in the manual working-classes than in other sections of the society.",5
1151,"It is the question of the economic status and opportunities of those who make up seven-eighths of the community, not of any submerged residuum…",5
1152,"The problem of poverty with which the student is concerned is primarily an industrial one,— and only secondly in its manifestations,—[found]in the mill, in the mine or at the docks,— not in casual wards or on the embankment.",5
1153,"(Townsend, 1976, p. 171)",5
1,PART 1 Introduction and overview,6
2,Introduction,6
3,Crime and criminals are topics of endless fascination.,6
4,"A glance at the newspapers or at the television programme schedules provides a clear indication of this enormous interest in crime, both ‘real life’ crime and fictional crime.",6
5,Yesterday's public enemies and villains have a habit of becoming present-day cult figures.,6
6,"Stories of the Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs and his life in Brazil arouse feelings close to affection, .",6
7,There are a variety or possible reasons for this interest.,6
8,"It may demonstrate a sense of outrage toward the criminal and the enjoyment of seeing the wrongdoer punished and justice being done, in the majority of crime stories and programmes the criminals come off worse.",6
9,"It may be that we secretly admire those who attempt to ‘beat the system’, and that we sympathise with the underdog.",6
10,"Alternately , this interest might demonstrate the excitement and enjoyment gained from reading about and watching that which we ourselves could not or would not do; a substituted excitement.",6
11,"Whatever the reasons, murder, rape, robbery, large-scale fraud and embezzlement, drug smuggling, gang warfare, delinquency make good subjects for conversation and exciting and profitable stories and films.",6
12,"The number of box-office successes at the cinema which have had crime as their central theme illustrates this vast interest — films ,,,,,and many more you could name.",6
13,"Someone from a different culture, or world, visiting our society could be excused for thinking that crime was a basic, ever-present feature of our everyday lives.",6
14,In reality the majority of people are not involved in such  spectacular criminality.,6
15,"However, we do not need to look far to see how the influence and effects of crime have imprinted themselves on our social environment.",6
16,"Locks, security staff, police, prisons, the mass media, insurance cover, safes reflect the extent of crime.",6
17,There would be little need to employ security guards or insure against theft if crime did not occur.,6
18,"Before we look at sociological research and theory on crime, it is necessary to define and make clear what our subject matter is.",6
19,"Crime is often equated with the term deviance, but there are problems in using the two terms interchangeably, as substitutes for .",6
20,While crime is frequently a major area of the study of deviance the relationship between the two needs to be made clear.,6
21,What is crime?,6
22,The definition of crime is fairly clear cut.,6
23,It is generally accepted that a crime is an act which breaks the criminal law.,6
24,"breaking the criminal law, a crime can be followed by criminal proceedings, including punishment.",6
25,"The phrase ‘can be followed by’ indicates that not all crime does actually result in police action and prosecution, an issue we will examine in more detail in a discussion of criminal statistics (Chapter 4).",6
26,"However, the criminal law is not fixed and static, it varies over time and from area to area.",6
27,"Therefore, the actions which are defined as criminal will vary with different social settings — in different societies and different periods of time.",6
28,"In other words, crime is a ; it can only be defined particular criminal laws which are effective at particular times and in particular societies.",6
29,"Such laws, and the criminal proceedings or punishments that follow the breaking of them, are not constant, they are always liable to change.",6
30,you can think of various acts which are crimes in this country but not in other countries; and of behaviour which is against the criminal law of other societies but which is not criminal in Britain.,6
31,The clearest illustrations of the relative nature of crime can be seen by comparing distinct and different cultures.,6
32,"Bigamy, , is a serious crime in Britain yet it is normal and accepted practice in other countries.",6
33,"Similarly, alcohol drinking is accepted and legal in some countries yet  illegal and severely punished in certain Moslem countries.",6
34,Even countries with broadly similar cultures can differ in what they define as criminal.,6
35,"In certain states of the USA the possession of small quantities of marijuana is not a criminal offence, although it is in Britain.",6
36,"differing from place to place, what is defined as crime changes over time.",6
37,In Britain today we have different criminal laws and hence a different range of crime from those which once existed.,6
38,"Homosexuality between consenting adults aged 21 or over, and abortion during a certain period of pregnancy, are not criminal offences , although they have been in the past.",6
39,"It is worth bearing in mind, however, that the de-criminalising of an activity (the removing of an activity from the scope of criminal law) does not mean that it necessarily becomes generally accepted.",6
40,"Although homosexuality is against the law, homosexuals still face a good deal of criticism and stigma.",6
41,The fact that what is seen as crime varies with different societies does not affect the definition of crime — as an act which breaks the criminal law of the particular society.,6
42,"Thus, our definition of crime is based on criminal laws which are made by particular governments and enforced by established criminal procedure.",6
43,"Crime, then, has to be seen as a socially variable phenomenon: it reflects what particular societies and governments, at particular times, include within their criminal laws and practices.",6
44,Deviance,6
45,"Deviance is a much wider and more vague concept than is crime, and is therefore less easy to define.",6
46,"The term itself is based on the verb ‘to deviate’, meaning to stray from, to digress.",6
47,"In one sense, deviance could be taken to mean any behaviour that differs from the normal, any uncommon or unusual behaviour.",6
48,"From such a position, deviant behaviour could be extremely good or  behaviour, risking one's life to help others or showing courage over and above the line of duty.",6
49,"It could be behaviour that is different or unusual in  that is disapproved of, stealing or children-battering.",6
50,"Or, it could be behaviour which is seen as eccentric or bizarre, not wearing shoes and socks  in conventional situations or carrying on prolonged conversations with the plants in one's garden.",6
51,"However, in sociology and in everyday use, the term deviance is generally applied to situations where the behaviour is disapproved of and some form of punishment.",6
52,"Deviance is thus used to describe behaviour that is outside the rules of society; and these rules can be legal rules or social and moral rules, rules about the conventional way to dress or to speak to other people, .",6
53,"Also, deviant behaviour is behaviour that can result in some form of punishment; and this punishment can be either a formal, legal punishment or take the form of social and moral disapproval.",6
54,"Deviance is behaviour which does not follow the expectations or norms of the majority in society, and it leads to a hostile and critical reaction from the majority.",6
55,It is this social reaction which generates and defines deviance.,6
56,"In other words, for an action to be deviant it has to cause some form of critical reaction and disapproval from others in the particular society.",6
57,No action is deviant in itself: it has to excite some reaction from others.,6
58,"In defining and distinguishing crime and deviance we have referred to rules, laws and norms, and to behaviour which does not follow them.",6
59,They are terms which you will encounter in the study of crime and deviance and it might be helpful to define and discuss each at this stage.,6
60,"Rules, laws and norms",6
61,A rule is a common and widely used term.,6
62,Rules can be formal and written or they can be unwritten.,6
63,The rules of a factory may be written down and serve as strict regulators of behaviour.,6
64,"In contrast, the rules of dress or of how we eat are unwritten guides to behaviour.",6
65,"In all cases, however, a rule is something that is held and accepted as right and legitimate by the members of a group or society.",6
66,"Laws are perhaps the best example of written, formal rules.",6
67,There are specific penalties drawn up to punish those who break laws.,6
68,"Generally speaking, the most important rules in society are those that make up the law, with laws decided upon by powerful and influential groups in society.",6
69,"to ensure that everyone keeps to the laws there are specific penalties, fines or  imprisonment, for those found guilty of breaking the law.",6
70,"Unlike other rules, rules of dress or of grammar, laws can always be enforced by law enforcement agencies the police and the courts in the last resort.",6
71,We have defined crime as behaviour which breaks the criminal law.,6
72,"However, there are different categories of law, with criminal law being one such category.",6
73,There is a basic distinction in the laws of this country between the criminal and the civil law.,6
74,"Broadly, civil law refers to the resolving of disputes between individuals, and the breaking of civil law results in less severe penalties, often the paying of compensation or ‘damages’.",6
75,"A norm is very much a general term, it is an expected standard of behaviour shared by members of a social group.",6
76,Norms can be thought of as unwritten rules.,6
77,"Any group of people will, over time, develop common rules governing their behaviour, and these rules are often described as norms.",6
78,"Examples of these unwritten rules are that parents should play with their children, or that one should respond in the appropriate manner to a ‘good morning’ greeting.",6
79,"Norms are, therefore, ideal standards of behaviour.",6
80,They are part of the culture of society and are passed on from one generation to the next.,6
81,"Although many norms are shared by the majority in society, there are also intra-group norms which govern the behaviour of particular groups of people but which may not be accepted by the majority.",6
82,"In a school, teachers may share different norms to students, and different groups of students (and teachers) may share different norms.",6
83,The relationship between crime and deviance,6
84,We have defined crime as an act which breaks the criminal law and deviance as behaviour which breaks or departs from the norms or standards of the majority in society.,6
85,"From these definitions you will see that crime and delinquency are one form of deviance (strictly speaking, delinquency refers to anti-social and illegal behaviour, but in sociology it is usually linked with ‘juvenile’ and used to refer to the criminality and misconduct of youths).",6
86,"They are perhaps the most obvious form of deviance, in that crime is clearly behaviour which breaks the standards of society and which can result in some punishment.",6
87,"It should also  be apparent, though, that there is a variety of other behaviour which is outside the rules and standards of society but which does not break the criminal law.",6
88,"Being an alcoholic is not against the law, and not criminal, although it is deviant.",6
89,"Similarly, becoming a hermit and avoiding contact with other people would be considered deviant behaviour but it is not criminal.",6
90,"Without labouring the point, it is clear that not all deviant behaviour is criminal, and it is important to be aware of the distinction between the two concepts.",6
91,"Thus, deviance is a broader concept than crime.",6
92,"However, and to complicate the issue, it does not necessarily follow that all crime is always viewed as deviant.",6
93,"You might be able to think of crimes that are not generally regarded as deviant — crime committed in self-defence, .",6
94,"Although theft is illegal it is often regarded as normal and acceptable practice when an individual ‘borrows’ materials from his or her place of work for personal use — stationery, or makes 'phone calls on an office telephone.",6
95,Thus the distinction between crime and deviance is straightforward and the relationship between the two has often been poorly understood.,6
96,"In this study we shall be examining crime, and while deviance does overlap with crime it is important not to simply identify crime with deviance.",6
97,The study of crime,6
98,"In the sociological study of crime, as with other areas of sociological study, the student is faced with an ever growing body of research and argument.",6
99,"But there is a general agreement on the major works which form the bases of the different perspectives or theories; as with other subjects, sociology has its ‘classics’.",6
100,Chapter 2 of this book covers the major theoretical approaches.,6
101,"It includes much that is central to the accepted body of the sociology of crime and deviance, but aims to introduce this material in an easily accessible form.",6
102,"In Chapter 3 we will look at specific examples of criminal behaviour, and will discuss and criticise some of the common assumptions about the nature and extent of crime in contemporary society.",6
103,"We will examine the history of delinquency in an attempt to correct the notion, or perhaps myth, that such behaviour is a uniquely modern  phenomenon that indicates a degeneration of standards of behaviour in present-day society.",6
104,"We will investigate the widely held belief that crime is a working-class phenomenon through an examination of some predominantly middle-class crimes, business or corporate crime.",6
105,"Similarly, we will look at female crime and the reasons why this makes up such a small proportion of known criminality.",6
106,Part Three is divided into two chapters.,6
107,"The first, Chapter 4, deals with the measurements of crime, the extent and character of recorded crime and the dangers of assuming that the criminal statistics accurately reflect the amount and character of crime that does occur.",6
108,Chapter 5  includes extended readings from a range of studies in the sociology of crime.,6
109,"Most of the readings will be from studies cited in the previous chapters, although some will be from studies not cited in the main text.",6
110,"This chapter will enable students to read and appreciate original sociological writing and research, rather then rely on reviews provided in textbooks.",6
111,"Before we commence with these main themes, some general comments on the sociology of crime as it is, and has been, studied might help students to appreciate the theories and research discussed in what follows.",6
112,"Sociology is a relatively new discipline or subject, although the issues examined by sociologists and the explanations put forward have a much longer history.",6
113,"Crime has persistently interested and worried people, and attempts to make sense of crime and criminal behaviour have appeared in literary and intellectual writings throughout the ages.",6
114,"The world of crime and, therefore, the sociological study of crime is vast and uncertain.",6
115,There is a massive amount of crime which is never recognised.,6
116,"The need for criminals to be secretive and not to advertise themselves adds to this uncertainty, and makes the study of crime more problematic than many other areas of sociological study.",6
117,"Naturally enough, those who commit crimes will tend to conceal their actions and protect themselves.",6
118,"The usual aim of the criminal is to remain anonymous, particularly if he or she wishes to continue to engage in criminal actions.",6
119,The secretive nature of crime raises a number of problems for the study of crime.,6
120,"In the first instance, there is a need to be alert to the potential for, and presence of, crime in conventional and  ordinary settings.",6
121,"Widespread and systematic crime occurs in normal, everyday situations.",6
122,"A study of a bakery in south-east England uncovered a highly organised system of stealing from work and of fiddling of customers by the bread salesmen (Ditton, 1977).",6
123,"In a similar manner, various other studies have indicated that a wide and diverse range of crime occurs at the workplace.",6
124,"Clearly, crime is not a rare occurrence, but it is hidden methodically, and this raises problems for research.",6
125,Initially it is necessary to find the subjects for study.,6
126,"How does one locate a fraud expert, ?",6
127,"Then, once located, the subjects have to be convinced that they can safely discuss their criminal behaviour.",6
128,The process of gaining the confidence of criminals is liable to be time-consuming and thus expensive.,6
129,Research into crime is likely to take comparatively longer than into other areas of social behaviour.,6
130,"Months or years may pass before intimacy and trust develop, and before a reasonable range of criminal actions can be observed closely.",6
131,Research and study problems are not limited to the area of crime and criminals.,6
132,"However, the effective study of crime requires the development of intimate associations with people who are by nature suspicious and unwilling to talk to outsiders.",6
133,"Bearing these problems and points in mind, the participant observation method of research has been particularly effective in the study of crime.",6
134,"Participant observations involves the observing of a phenomenon as an ‘insider’, through contacting and gaining acceptance from the people or groups being studied.",6
135,"While other research methods, interviews or questionnaires, can be effectively used to gain a wider picture, participant observation enables the investigator to understand behaviour through direct, personal experience.",6
136,This is not to suggest that such observation is itself a straightforward method of investigation.,6
137,The researcher has to remain an objective and outside recorder of events at the same time as being closely involved with the people and events that are being studied.,6
138,"Furthermore, it is difficult for the participant observer not to exert some influence on the events that are being observed.",6
139,Some of the problems inherent in the sociological study of crime are illustrated in the first reading in Chapter 5 (pages 76–77).,6
140,"In what follows we will introduce various aspects of the sociological study of crime, and examine theories and measurement of crime, and illustrations of specific criminal behaviour.",6
141,"However, it is important to bear in mind that while most people break some, if not many, of the laws of their society, few people are found guilty of criminal offences.",6
142,"It is useful, therefore, to ask initially why so many people do not become recognised as criminals: to look at why so many conform, or do not become regular or serious offenders against the criminal law.",6
143,"In exploring this problem, it is common to point to two basic types of social control or restraint.",6
144,"The mechanisms of control, which centre around the socialisation process — people learn that stealing, cheating and the like are wrong; and the mechanics , which involve formal, legally established penalties.",6
145,In analysing and explaining crime we will need to examine why these control mechanisms do not exert the same influence on all individuals and social groups.,6
146,Discussion exercise,6
147,"To elaborate on this division and to gain a clearer understanding of the different types of social control, it would be useful for you to try a brief exercise, answering and discussing the following questions.",6
148,These questions could be looked at within small groups of students.,6
149,1,6
150,Ask yourself and your colleagues why you follow the laws of society.,6
151,Do the answers given suggest that laws are followed because they are agreed with and felt to be right — indicating the influence of informal control mechanisms?,6
152,Or do they suggest that laws are followed the fear of being caught and punished — indicating the influence of formal control mechanisms?,6
153,2,6
154,Why do you not steal from shops?,6
155,(Assuming that you don't!),6
156,"Is it because you believe it wrong to do so, or because you are afraid of being caught and of the consequences if you are?",6
157,"In other words, are formal or informal mechanisms of control the major influence?",6
158,"Alternatively, if you do steal from shops what would stop you doing so?",6
159,Better security and greater risk?,6
160,"Or, becoming convinced that such actions are wrong?",6
161,3,6
162,Would you steal from shops if it could be guaranteed that you would not get caught?,6
163,‘Yes’ answers to this question would suggest that formal social control mechanisms are the major influence shoplifting.,6
164,4,6
165,Would you distinguish between different types of shop?,6
166,"Between a small, local shop where there  likely to be less security, and a large supermarket or department store?",6
167,", it is not always easy to pinpoint exactly why we do or do not engage in a particular action.",6
168,"Often the reasons will reflect a mixture of informal and formal social controls, while the importance of either will vary with different circumstances.",6
169,"Although it might be very easy to steal from a friend or colleague and not get caught most people would feel this to be ‘wrong’, yet such feelings may not exert such a strong influence over decisions as to whether to steal from a larger and less personal victim.",6
170,PART 2 Sociology and crime,6
171,Explaining crime: theories of criminality,6
172,Most people have their own notions or theories what causes criminal behaviour.,6
173,", lack of discipline in the home, genetic defects, poverty, mixing with the ‘wrong sort’ have all been proposed as causes of criminality.",6
174,"While such notions may all contains some elements of truth, they are complete explanations of criminal behaviour.",6
175,This chapter will examine a range of theories which attempt to explain such behaviour.,6
176,"Although the major theoretical explanations are covered in the numerous introductions to the sociology of crime and deviance and to sociology generally, some review of these theories is necessary before embarking upon an examination of specific, substantive examples of criminal behaviour.",6
177,"As this is not a book on criminological theories, what follows will be a brief overview of a wide range of theories and explanations.",6
178,"First, a word of warning might be in order.",6
179,"It would be naive to expect to uncover any ultimate explanation or basic cause for criminal behaviour, given the extensive and diverse behaviour that is encompassed by the term crime.",6
180,"Suppose, , that it could be proved that one cause of delinquency was lack of parental supervision.",6
181,It might still be necessary to ask why delinquency occurred with one son or daughter but not another.,6
182,"Also, there would be the further question of why the parents had not provided adequate supervision.",6
183,Perhaps this was their poor living conditions which would raise the question of why they were in poor housing.,6
184,Was this governmental housing policy or a poor employment record the bread-winner of the family?,6
185,"Clearly, we are getting further and further the causes of delinquent behaviour, and it  is perhaps wisest to think causal processes when looking at criminal behaviour.",6
186,Biological and psychological theories,6
187,"Before examining the major sociological  on crime, it is useful to refer to theories from sociology, from other academic disciplines.",6
188,"Thus, we will look initially at biological and psychological theories.",6
189,Biological theories,6
190,Biological (or physiological) explanations are based on the notion that some individuals are predisposed to criminal behaviour their genetic make-up.,6
191,"The individual criminal is born so; and this is usually put down to ‘faulty chromosome patterns’, or, more vaguely, to ‘hereditary traits’.",6
192,"The most famous exponent of this approach was the nineteenth-century Italian physician,.",6
193,"In his book , Lombroso developed a complex description of what he called the ‘born criminal’, who could be recognised by a variety of physical characteristics, in particular facial characteristics — large jaws and ears, and high cheek bones.",6
194,In the medical faculty at the University of Rome there is a gallery of portraits of splendidly ugly delinquents who were used to illustrate Lombroso's theory.,6
195,To use his own language:,6
196,"Thus were explained anatomically the enormous jaws, high cheek bones, prominent superciliary arches, solitary lines on the palms, extreme size of the orbits, handle-shaped or sessile ears found in criminals, savages and apes, insensibility of pain, extremely acute sight, tattooing, excessive idleness, love of orgies and the  craving for evil for its own sake…",6
197,These explanations see the delinquent individual as inherently more prone to criminal behaviour than the non-delinquent.,6
198,They have been widely criticised and rejected by sociologists.,6
199,"Lombroso's work, , was based on his examination of people in prison in Italy.",6
200,"This would, necessarily, ignore the fact that many criminals do not go to prison, and that, perhaps, people in prison are not always criminal.",6
201,"Most advocates of biological theories do not express themselves in the same bizarre language and style as Lombroso, and such theories of crime are not merely historical relics that died with Lombroso.",6
202,"In a major study of institutionalised delinquents (delinquents in some form of custody) in the USA in the 1950s,found that delinquent boys were twice as likely to have a mesomorphic build, a chunky, muscular  , compared with non-delinquent boys.",6
203,"However, the fact that the study was restricted to institutionalised delinquents limits the validity of the association between body build and crime and delinquency.",6
204,It may be that tougher-looking delinquents are more liable to be put away than fragile looking ones.,6
205,"Furthermore, it has been found that the association between delinquency on the one hand and height, weight and physique on the other is greatly reduced once social, background factors are taken into account.",6
206,", lower working-class people are more likely to be mesomorphic as a result of their diet and continual manual labour, and this class grouping is more likely to be found represented in the criminal statistics.",6
207,"the links between criminal behaviour and inherited characteristics, there have been a number of theoretical explanations suggesting an association between criminality and particular personality characteristics.",6
208,"An example of this more sophisticated biological approach is the work of Hans Eysenck, who has argued in a series of studies, that there is a link between genetically based personality characteristics and criminal behaviour.",6
209,He maintains that there is a link between characteristics extroversion and criminal behaviour.,6
210,"An individual's degree of extroversion or introversion is inherited, determined by his or her genetic make-up.",6
211,"The link with crime found by Eysenck was that when prisoners were tested for extroversion, more extroverts were found than in the general population.",6
212,Eysenck then argues that extroversion is the inherited basis of criminal behaviour.,6
213,"Extroverts take longer to learn the rules of society, they are more likely to break them, and thus more likely become convicted criminals.",6
214,"As with Lombroso's work and the Gluecks' study discussed above, by starting with institutionalised criminals, it is assumed that all prisoners are criminals and that most criminals do, in fact, go to prison.",6
215,The people who get caught and imprisoned  may not be a representative picture of all criminals.,6
216,The major problem faced by theories suggesting a link between genetic make-up and criminal behaviour is the difficulty of distinguishing between genetic and environmental effects.,6
217,"While some genetic influence cannot be ruled out, just what is inherited remains very unclear.",6
218,Psychological theories,6
219,These theories share certain similarities with biological explanations.,6
220,They stress the link between criminal behaviour and specific personality traits or characteristics.,6
221,"Psychological theories, however, see these characteristics as a result of unusual or abnormal experiences, as inherited.",6
222,"Thus, as with biological theories, crime is seen as pathological (a disease), as something to be looked at from the medical point of view.",6
223,"However, psychological causes are seen as treatable, whereas biological causes mark the individual for life.",6
224,"In those cases there is no possible treatment, one is born a criminal.",6
225,"Many psychological theories refer to faulty parent-child relationships, abnormal experiences in early childhood having a lasting effect and influence on personality.",6
226,"Studies in this area have indicated that too strict or too lax parental attitudes increase the risk of delinquency (the work of John Bowlby, ); they have found that if a young child is deprived of close personal relationships with parents or parent figures then ‘problem behaviour’ is more common.",6
227,"It is well established that in the delinquent-prone, home discipline is more liable to be too lax, strict or erratic.",6
228,"However, it is patently obvious that parents can be a good or bad influence and example for their children, and this fact can hardly be used to explain present patterns of crime.",6
229,"The majority of offenders do not come from disturbed or broken homes, and many broken homes do not produce delinquents.",6
230,", this last point does not show that there is link between parent-child relations and crime and delinquency.",6
231,"The problem with assessing the influence of parental and family dimensions, weak supervision or parental criminality, is the fact that they are closely linked to various aspects of social and economic disadvantage, poverty, overcrowding and poor housing.",6
232,"And it may be that these disadvantages help to  cause parental difficulties, and hamper good parenting.",6
233,"We can hardly do justice to the wide scope of psychological theories here, but there are some basic ideas and assumptions which underlie such theorizing.",6
234,"These stress the importance of family relationships and upbringing during the early years, and conclude that anti-social, and by implication criminal, behaviour results from faulty personality development.",6
235,"To summarise, these biological and psychological theories hold that the criminal is a particular type of person, the rest of society and with a special predisposition toward criminal behaviour.",6
236,"They are based on the idea that criminal behaviour is either inherited or a consequence of unique, individual experiences.",6
237,"Before we look at sociological explanations it might be useful to ask yourself, or to discuss with colleagues, whether you feel that criminals are different ‘types’ of person.",6
238,"While there are, , predispositions toward criminal behaviour, and clearly certain characteristics are inherited, most sociologists would reject these ‘individual pathology’ sort of theories.",6
239,They lack convincing supporting evidence.,6
240,While some offenders suffer from mental disorders the vast majority do not.,6
241,"Furthermore, if criminals are abnormal then it follows that a large proportion of the population must also be abnormal.",6
242,"For numerous studies have shown that a high percentage of the population have committed criminal offences, in particular high proportions of juveniles, and it is difficult to believe that they are all different or abnormal.",6
243,Sociological theories,6
244,We said above that sociologists would reject non-sociological explanations of crime.,6
245,"This is not because such explanations are ‘wrong’, but because they are incomplete or inadequate.",6
246,"In Chapter One, it was stressed that crime cannot be considered its social context, that it is dependent on society defining certain actions as criminal, and on the reaction of others to such actions.",6
247,"Thus, we have to see crime and the criminal the social structure, to specific social conditions and opportunities.",6
248,"While sociological explanations vary considerably in their emphasis on the different factors within the social structure which can be linked with crime, there is a general  acceptance of social forces as causing or influencing criminal behaviour.",6
249,"In our discussion of sociological explanations we will concentrate on the three major sociological perspectives and how they analyse and interpret crime — Functionalism, Interactionism and Marxism.",6
250,"However, these perspectives are broad schools of thought and include often distinct strands of theorising.",6
251,"Also, all sociological theories of crime fit neatly into one or other ‘ism’, but often straddle different perspectives.",6
252,"Nonetheless, following these conventional divisions does enable us to discuss sociological theories of crime as they have developed.",6
253,"It enables different theories to be understood in a historical, chronological sequence, one set of theories developing from and often criticising previous work.",6
254,"Thus, the whole of this section will read something like a ‘debate’.",6
255,"At the risk of oversimplification, functionalist approaches were challenged by interactionist sociology in the 1960s and 1970s; which has itself been criticised by the revival of Marxist-based theories.",6
256,Functionalist theories,6
257,"Functionalist theory is not just one overall explanation or interpretation, and the examples we will look at have quite distinct emphases.",6
258,"The general, underlying characteristic common to all functionalist-based theory is a stress on the importance of shared norms and values which form the basis for social order.",6
259,Crime consists of acts which break or depart from these shared norms and values.,6
260,CLASSIC FUNCTIONALIST THEORY: EMILE DURKHEIM,6
261,"Classic functionalist theory points to the function of crime for society, and suggests that crime is universal, normal and functional to society; criminal behaviour helps to sustain conformity and stability and is thereby functional.",6
262,"crime is behaviour that breaks rules, it might seem odd that functionalists argue that it is necessary and useful for society.",6
263,"However, while agreeing that crime must be controlled, this functionalist argument is that some criminal behaviour has positive and useful functions.",6
264,"This approach or argument is based on the work of , the founding father of functionalist sociology.",6
265,"Durkheim saw crime as a normal phenomenon in society: ‘it is a factor in public health and an integral part of all societies…crime, is, then, necessary’(from , first published in 1895).",6
266,"The fact that some individuals commit acts which break the rules of society is accompanied by a sense of outrage with reinforces, in the majority, support of the rules (both moral and legal) of the society.",6
267,The presence of the criminal allows the rest to draw together and reaffirm their values.,6
268,"Thus, through opposition to criminal behaviour the social group or society is strengthened.",6
269,"It is not the criminal acts themselves which draw the majority together, but the publicising and punishing of crime, with the public trial of law-breakers also helping to clarify the boundaries of socially acceptable behaviour.",6
270,"Durkheim regards the criminal as someone who provides the community with an opportunity to reassert standards, which he or she had broken or opposed.",6
271,It is this argument which leads Durkheim to state that crime is essential to the continuation of society.,6
272,If society is to exist as a unity there must be an agreement on shared values.,6
273,For this agreement to exist people need to be able to react against those who depart from or break shared values.,6
274,It is crime which serves to create this reaction.,6
275,If societies ‘need’ crime then it is logical to assume that they will ensure that there will be crime.,6
276,"It is possible for us to image a society of saints in which committed what we see as crimes, in which everyone behaved in an impeccable manner.",6
277,"However, within such a community, Durkheim argues that the division between what is acceptable and unacceptable behaviour would still exist.",6
278,Faults which we might see as trivial would create the same scandal and outrage as criminal behaviour does in our society.,6
279,"Although talking of the inevitability and necessity of crime, Durkheim did not mean to suggest the more crime the better.",6
280,"He saw a certain level of crime as functional from the point of view of social order, but beyond that level it would cease to be functional and become dangerous or pathological.",6
281,"The argument that crime is necessary and functional does not explain the causes of it, nor does it explain why some people are motivated to engage in criminal activities.",6
282,"More recent functionalist work, though, has been concerned with the ‘causes’ of criminal behaviour.",6
283,ROBERT MERTON,6
284,"Merton starts from the basic functionalist position that social stability is based on a strong consensus of values, which the majority of people come to share.",6
285,"However, not every member of society is in a position to achieve these values.",6
286,Merton suggests that criminal and rule-breaking behaviour results from ‘differentials in access to the success goals of society by legitimate means’.,6
287,What does he mean by this?,6
288,"In societies where there is a strong emphasis on certain goals, but where the means for obtaining them are unavailable to most citizens, the result is a situation of ; a situation, in other words, where the rules and standards governing behaviour have lost their influence and force and are liable to be ignored, and where shared norms or rules determine and direct behaviour.",6
289,"In present-day western society we have cultural goals of material success: plenty of money, a big house, flash cars, pretty girl/handsome boy, .",6
290,"Although the desirability of such goals is constantly stressed by society, different groups in society clearly have different degrees of access to them.",6
291,"Certain groups are well equipped to achieve such goals through legitimate means, , those with enough wealth and power to transfer to their children.",6
292,"At the other extreme, there are groups who face an enormous task in realising their goals.",6
293,"It is in these circumstances that there occurs, Merton, a situation of anomie, with people striving for goals of material success, but not having the opportunities to reach them through legitimate means.",6
294,"For Merton, such behaviour occurs as a result of a discrepancy or contradiction between the aspirations which society has socialised into its members (the ends or goals) and the way that is provided for the realisation of such aspirations (the means).",6
295,So people have to devise ways of adapting to this gap between what they want and expect from society and the means they have available to obtain these things.,6
296,Merton put forward five possible ways of adapting to this gap.,6
297,"Firstly,, accepting the goals and means.",6
298,"Secondly,, which involves the adoption of unconventional methods of chasing the goals, through crime.",6
299,"Thirdly,, abandoning the goals but sticking rigidly to the legitimate means of achieving them.",6
300,"Fourthly,, abandoning both the goals and the means, ‘dropping out’ of society.",6
301,"Fifthly,, giving up the conventional goals and means and replacing them with new ones.",6
302,Merton's model or theory does not adequately explain all types of criminal behaviour.,6
303,It is difficult to point to the material goals which football hooligans or juvenile delinquents are chasing.,6
304,"The theory seems to have a middle class bias in that it assumes that all criminal and rule-breakers accept and cherish middle-class goals, but many delinquent activities do not appear to be aiming for material gains.",6
305,"This is a general danger or problem with theories that are based on a consensus view of society — a view that society is held together by common values, shared by all.",6
306,Merton's theory does not explain why some individuals faced with a situation of anomie conform while others break the rules.,6
307,"Nor does it explain why one type of adaptation another occurs; , why innovation occurs retreatism, or vice-versa.",6
308,"Also, no explanation is offered how society defines criminal behaviour, why some acts are made illegal and others not.",6
309,"Nonetheless, the work of Merton has certain strengths.",6
310,"It explains criminal behaviour the structure and culture of society, individual characteristics.",6
311,Hence it is a .,6
312,"Further, in developing this approach Merton laid the ground for later work on crime based on the notion of , the notion that there are certain groups who will be more liable to break the rules of society.",6
313,We will now review some of the major developments from functionalist theory based on notions of culture and subculture.,6
314,Albert Cohen and subcultural theories,6
315,"In his widely cited study , Cohen questions whether delinquent behaviour is caused directly by the desire for material goals.",6
316,"While some forms of delinquent behaviour are clearly centred on acquiring goods or money, a large amount of delinquency is expressive in character.",6
317,", it is not directly concerned with material gain; delinquency  on vandalism or violence is an obvious example.",6
318,Cohen looks to the educational system for his explanation of delinquency.,6
319,"Schools, he argues emphasise and embody middle-class  values.",6
320,"Thus, individuals socialised into the working classes will suffer from , and will adopt an outlook set on turning the middle-class value system on its head.",6
321,"Anything which the school sees as wrong, the working-class delinquent will see as good; delinquency is explained as a direct denial of middle-class values.",6
322,"In his study, Cohen compares what he terms the ‘street corner boy’ with the ‘college boy’.",6
323,"Because working-class boys suffer disadvantages in the educational system and are not brought up to accept the values of this system, they are likely to reject the school values and form a (Cohen's definition of this subculture is reproduced as Reading 2 in Chapter 5).",6
324,"Cohen stresses therefore, the collective  as central to delinquency, seeing such behaviour as an individual response to the failure to achieve middle-class goals, as Merton argued.",6
325,"His theory is, however, open to similar criticisms to those made about Merton's work.",6
326,"The claim that status frustration is the motivating factor also suffers from a middle-class bias, it is assumed that delinquents cherish middle-class status goals, educational success.",6
327,"Moreover, it is perhaps doubtful whether many delinquents hold openly oppositional views or values as Cohen suggests.",6
328,"Furthermore, although delinquency is invariably a group activity it does not always take place within organised delinquent gangs, which is the basis of Cohen's theoretical approach.",6
329,"Certainly, organised, structured delinquent gangs do not appear to be the norm in Britain today.",6
330,Another ‘subcultural’ -type theory that stresses deprivation and develops and draws on the work of Merton and Cohen is that of .,6
331,"Briefly, Cloward and Ohlin argue that there is greater pressure on members of the working class to behave criminally or delinquently the fact that they have less opportunity to succeed by legitimate means.",6
332,"They agree with Cohen's argument that working-class boys are likely to form and join delinquent subcultures, but they feel he has not taken account of the different and specialised types of subculture that exist.",6
333,"They suggest that the potentially delinquent individual may respond to his situation by joining one of three types of subculture: a criminal subculture, where delinquency is linked with adult criminality; a conflict subculture, which occurs in areas where links between juvenile and adult criminality are not established; and, thirdly, a retreatist or ‘escapist’ subculture.",6
334,Recent developments in the sociology of crime: the deviant as normal,6
335,The theories looked at thus far have moved the view of the criminal as clearly distinguishable from the non-criminal.,6
336,The biological and psychological theories stressed this distinctiveness.,6
337,The functionalist approaches see crime as a  of people to their social situation.,6
338,"However, in responding to their situation criminals are seen as becoming distinct from the mainstream, non-criminal population.",6
339,"We will now turn to theoretical approaches which see the criminal as ‘normal’, and which centre on how society defines certain individuals as criminal or deviant.",6
340,", the Interactionist and Marxist approaches.",6
341,Interactional theories,6
342,"To overcome some of the problems associated with the structural and subcultural-orientated theories based on the functionalist perspective, Interactionism has adopted a different theoretical perspective for examining crime and rule-breaking.",6
343,"One of the major criticisms of these previous theories has been that they have tended to see their subject matter (, rule-breaking) as straightforward and easily identifiable — crime being behaviour that breaks certain of the rules of society.",6
344,This implies that social groups are characterised by consensus.,6
345,"Interactionists would question that implication, and argue that they are made up of a plurality of values and norms, which may often conflict.",6
346,"As suggested above, Interactionists would also deny that criminals are essentially different from other, so-called ‘normal’, people.",6
347,"Various studies have demonstrated that very few people have not broken laws, and many people do so frequently without ever having their ‘crimes’ recorded.",6
348,"Thus, if a majority of people commit criminal actions it becomes somewhat dubious to maintain a distinction between criminal and non-criminal, personal  .",6
349,LABELLING,6
350,"Interactionist approaches to crime and deviance have centred around the concept of labelling, with the term sometimes used to refer to the Interactionist perspective on rule-breaking.",6
351,"From this viewpoint, the criminal is an individual who has been labelled so by society, and this labelling does not apply to all individuals who break laws.",6
352,"As mentioned, many people who break laws are never found out and are thus not labelled as criminals.",6
353,"Interactionism stresses the arbitrariness of this labelling of someone, or of some action, as criminal.",6
354,It focusses on the interaction between the criminal or deviant and those who define him/her as such.,6
355,The classic statement on the labelling perspective is found in the work of :,6
356,Social groups create deviance by making rules whose infraction constitutes deviance and by applying those rules to particular people and labelling them as outsiders.,6
357,"From this point of view deviance is not a quality of the act a person commits, but rather a consequence of the application by others of rules and sanctions to an offender.",6
358,The deviant is the one to whom that label has been successfully applied; deviant behaviour is behaviour that people so label.,6
359,"Becker, 1963",6
360,"Labelling, therefore, refers to the process by which individuals and groups classify and categorise social behaviour and other individuals.",6
361,"If a criminal is a person labelled as such, an initial question we must ask is ‘Who does the labelling?’",6
362,"And, when we see terms ‘social problem’ or ‘criminal’, we need to ask ‘who defines these terms?’, and to be as concerned with the actions and motives of the labellers as those who are labelled.",6
363,The reason for this emphasis on the way in which people are labelled is that laws are essentially political products.,6
364,"They reflect the fact that some groups in society can create laws, and can determine what behaviour is seen as criminal.",6
365,"Interactionists stress that definitions of crime reflect the power of groups who have managed to impose their ideas about right and wrong, normality on society.",6
366,", there are laws to curb the powerful also.",6
367,"However, Interactionists suggest that they are less frequently and vigorously applied.",6
368,This point leads us an examination of the selective nature of law enforcement.,6
369,SELECTIVE ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW,6
370,"In a study of the administration of juvenile justice in the USA  , 1976) looked at the actual process of how delinquency and criminality is defined and applied to certain individuals.",6
371,"Without going into his work in any detail, Cicourel found that white, middle-class youths are less liable to be identified by police and probation officers as having committed or being likely to commit a crime.",6
372,The police are more likely to react toward those groups and individuals whom they see as being prone to commit criminal actions; often labelling such individuals before they actually commit a criminal act.,6
373,"The police, like most people, have stereotypical views the ‘typical’ criminal or delinquent.",6
374,"In the procedures of arresting and charging individuals and in their treatment in court, there are clear differences across the middle/working-class divide; and these serve to reinforce the public's (and the police's) perception that certain groups are inclined to criminality.",6
375,"Cicourel suggests that certain groups are selected, processed and labelled as criminal.",6
376,Interactionist approaches to explaining crime imply that for the purpose of studying such behaviour there is a correlation between being regarded as a criminal and in fact becoming one.,6
377,Sociological study does not aim to discover who is innocent of the charges against them and who is guilty.,6
378,"For our purposes, being found guilty is the same as being guilty.",6
379,"Now, you might feel that there is a significant difference between a murderer or bank robber and someone who has been wrongfully convicted of murder or bank robbery.",6
380,"However, this difference is not likely to have any effect on the way in which the individuals will be treated.",6
381,The wrongfully convicted prisoner will be treated identically to any other prisoner by prison officers.,6
382,"Furthermore, protesting one's innocence will be seen as the kind of thing that everyone who is convicted does.",6
383,"Being convicted involves being identified publicly as a criminal, and it is in this context that we can say that being found guilty is the same as being guilty.",6
384,"Thus, being known to be a criminal is the same as being one treatment.",6
385,"It is for this reason that Interactionists stress that labelling is crucial to understanding criminal behaviour, as the labelling process publicly identifies individuals as guilty of criminal acts.",6
386,THE AMPLIFICATION OF CRIMINALITY,6
387,Thus far we have examined the process by which individuals  become labelled.,6
388,One important issue we have not considered is what happens to the individual once he or she is labelled as criminal.,6
389,"In other words, what is the effect of labelling on the individual?",6
390,"Labelling an individual will tend to mark them out, and knowing a person has been labelled is liable to influence others' behaviour toward that person.",6
391,", knowing someone has been convicted of theft might influence one's reactions and attitudes to that person.",6
392,"Furthermore, the individual who has been labelled is likely to view him/herself the label and act accordingly.",6
393,"This leads to a process of or snowballing: individuals who are caught and labelled as criminal see themselves so and act accordingly, thus the label becomes more widely applied and firmly fixed, and the criminal becomes more attached to that label.",6
394,"Interactionists argue that societal reaction, labelling, can actually increase or ‘amplify’ the criminal behaviour of the labelled individual or group.",6
395,"This amplification process occurs on the wider, societal level on the individual level.",6
396,"work on ‘Hippies’ and police in London during the late 1960s illustrates this wider application (Young, in Cohen, S. ed., 1971).",6
397,"Young found that the harder the police tried to stamp out drug use the more it grew, becoming a symbol of defiance for hippies.",6
398,He suggested that the police acted as amplifiers of this illegal behaviour.,6
399," to control drug use, through the formation of drug squads, helped to amplify it.",6
400,"The drug squads discovered more cases of drug use, which led to more police manpower and money being invested, which led to more discovery.",6
401,There was thus a ‘spiral of amplification’.,6
402,the Interactionist approach — critical comments,6
403,"Labelling theory implies that criminals are powerless, passive victims who have had the misfortune to be labelled criminal, and have not been able to do anything about it.",6
404,By placing such emphasis on social reaction it can be argued that Interactionists have minimised the role of the individual criminal.,6
405,"Linked with this point, labelling theories tend to disregard the origins of criminal behaviour.",6
406,"They concentrate on the present situation and the reaction of society and show little interest in the  criminal's background, although labelling theory does not argue that all that is involved in making someone a criminal is to call them one.",6
407,Labelling is acknowledged as a complex process involving social norms and values.,6
408,"So far as the amplification of criminal behaviour is concerned, no explanation is offered how and why this process ends.",6
409,"Logically, the social reaction could be expected to grow, as would the individual's criminality, with all law-breakers becoming extreme and committed criminals.",6
410,"While some follow this path, many others conform again, and do not become committed in their ways.",6
411,People vary in how they respond to labelling; being labelled may deter criminal activity amplify it.,6
412,"Moreover, labels need not be permanent and irreversible.",6
413,"Finally, Interactionists lay great stress on social reaction without really attempting to explain why some actions are made illegal, without examining who constructs specific laws, and why.",6
414,"Interactionism raises the issue of the relation between power and crime, but does not really answer it.",6
415,"It concentrates on the specific interactions, the ‘drama’, without investigating the importance of the social system itself.",6
416,"Interactionists look at the police, the courts and the criminals without examining the power underlying the system.",6
417,To do this would require an analysis of how decision-making and power is distributed in society.,6
418,This is an area of investigation central to Marxist-based work on crime.,6
419,Marxist theories,6
420,Marxist-based studies of crime are sometimes referred to under the titles of radical or critical criminology.,6
421,This work centres on a examination of how crime is related to the power structure of society.,6
422,"We should remember that neither Marx nor Engels, his co-author, proposed a theory of crime; and it has been later social theorists working within a Marxist framework who have developed a Marxist theory of crime.",6
423,"From a Marxist perspective crime is largely the product of capitalism, and the relatively high rate of crime in capitalist society is an indicator of the contradictions and problems inherent in such a system.",6
424,"Thus, many forms of crime are to be expected under a capitalist system.",6
425,"This is due, , to the  ability of the powerful to criminalise and stigmatise that which threatens their interests; and to the fact that basic motivations of capitalist societies, materialism and self-enrichment, can be pursued both legally and illegally.",6
426,"crime, perhaps the crucial question for Marxists is not ‘Why does crime occur?’, but ‘Why doesn't it occur more often?’",6
427,Crime and the wider Marxist analysis,6
428,"A Marxist analysis of crime is not easily explainable, and has to be understood wider aspects of Marxist theory.",6
429,"As Jock Young suggests, ‘it is not the criminal nor even the administration of crime, but, in the final analysis, the system itself that must be investigated’.",6
430,"Marxists hold that there is a basic distinction between the of society, which determines the organisation and structure of society, and the , the cultural, legal, religious, political aspects of society.",6
431,These aspects of the superstructure reflect the economic base.,6
432,"Therefore, the law will reflect the interests of the dominant economic class, and as an instrument of the dominant class the state passes laws which support its interests.",6
433,"The various social control agencies of the state, the police and courts, perform in a way that is consistent with the interests of the powerful, and against the interests of other groups, particularly the working classes.",6
434,Criminal law is assumed to express and reflect the interests of the ruling class.,6
435,"As evidence for this, Marxists point out that much of the criminal law is about the protection of property.",6
436,"Furthermore, there has been a vast increase in the range of behaviour that has come under the control of the law.",6
437,"In their introduction to (1975), Taylor, Walton and Young point out that old laws have been reactivated and new laws created to control and contain an ever widening range of socially problematic behaviour.",6
438,New laws have been created in this country to regulate industrial dissent and the rights of workers to organise.,6
439,"This extension of the law has created new criminals who do not fit the picture of the ‘typical criminal’, the young, working-class male.",6
440,"this, Taylor and colleagues argue that criminology needs to centre on theories of rule-making and breaking the  distribution of power in society.",6
441,"However, power in modern capitalist societies is not just the ability to influence the way people think, and includes the control of knowledge and of ideas.",6
442,"It is from the that standards of acceptable, normal behaviour are defined; and it is from this ideology that what constitutes social problems and criminal actions are also defined.",6
443,"A good example of this is the way in which the law, the media and public opinion view supplementary benefit fraud, ‘fiddling the dole’.",6
444,"It is commonly assumed that this is widespread and costs enormous sums of money, and that it is a more serious offence than tax-evasion, which in fact costs the exchequer billions of pounds, far the cost of social security fiddling.",6
445,"Various Marxist-based studies have aimed to demonstrate how the law reflects economic interests, viewing the legal system as an instrument that supports the interests of the dominant class against threatening or disruptive behaviour.",6
446,It has also been argued that the legal system enables the powerful to get away with exploiting other people without actually breaking the law.,6
447,"Frank Pearce has argued that organised crime in the USA is dominated by big business; and William Chambliss, in a detailed study of crime in Seattle, Washington, has demonstrated the numerous interconnections between organised crime and the ruling groups in society.",6
448,"Another important example of the way in which the criminal law reflects ruling-class interests is the way in which the ‘crime problem’ tends to be equated with working-class crime, often of a very trivial nature, the more important, money,.",6
449,"White-collar crime is crime that is centred around systematic fraud and fiddling by white-collar, middle-class employers and employees.",6
450,"One aspect of this type of criminality, business or corporate crime, will be discussed in some depth in Chapter 3.",6
451,A further aspect of the Marxist approach to crime concerns the way in which the law is enforced.,6
452,It is argued that the law is selectively enforced in the interests of the ruling classes — an issue dealt with more fully in Chapter 4.,6
453,"Very briefly, the basic Marxist argument is that the selective enforcement of the law, by largely ignoring white-collar/business crime, gives the impression that criminals are mainly from the working classes, which serves to direct attention ‘ruling-class crime’.",6
454,Marxist approach — critical comments,6
455,"As we have suggested, Marxist approaches to crime are based on the wider Marxist theory of society.",6
456,"Criticism of this approach to crime would, therefore, require a criticism of Marxist theory as a whole.",6
457,", if the predominance of economic interests and power over other areas of society is not accepted, then the Marxist theory of crime would not be accepted.",6
458,"Nonetheless, some specific issues can be raised.",6
459,"Firstly, it is difficult to argue that every law defining certain actions as criminal is related to supporting the interests of the dominant classes.",6
460,Many criminal actions appear to offer little threat to the capitalist class system.,6
461,"A more basic and crucial point is that the logical conclusion of the Marxist approach would be that the introduction of socialism will lead to a society without crime, where collective interests and responsibilities are all important.",6
462,Can one be convinced of this?,6
463,It is certainly the case that crime rates in socialist countries are far less than in the USA and other capitalist societies.,6
464,"However, all criminality in western societies could be related to the capitalist system, there is plenty of evidence of both criminal and deviant behaviour in communist societies, theft, murder and dissent.",6
465,"It is doubtful that such activities can be interpreted as remnants from pre-communist society, soon to disappear as socialism or communism comes of age.",6
466,Studying crime: pictures of contemporary criminality,6
467,In the previous chapter we looked at crime and criminality in a very broad and general manner.,6
468,This chapter will provide a more detailed examination of specific aspects of criminality.,6
469,In Chapter 4 we will examine the statistics on crime.,6
470,For the purposes of the present discussion we can say that these statistics display a number of clear patterns.,6
471,"Firstly, the statistics show an ever increasing rate of crime and imply, therefore, that much crime is a new, peculiarly modern phenomenon.",6
472,"Secondly, they show that crime is predominately a working-class phenomenon.",6
473,"Thirdly, that it is a male phenomenon.",6
474,"We will examine and discuss each of these patterns in this chapter, and in doing so will aim to look behind the picture of crime and criminals provided by criminal statistics.",6
475,Extended readings from a number of the studies we look at will be included in Chapter 5.,6
476,Crime as a modern phenomenon,6
477,This section will take issue with the notion of crime as somehow unique to contemporary society.,6
478,"While would deny the existence of horrendous acts of violence and criminality in earlier times, it is a widely held belief that western, advanced societies are becoming more and more criminal.",6
479,This is reflected in the tendency to look back to a ‘golden age’ when these societies were thought to be more peaceful and law abiding.,6
480,"To examine the truth and relevance of these notions, we will look at juvenile delinquency,  and vandalism.",6
481,"It is this sort of criminal behaviour which is commonly seen as characteristic of (if not central to) mass, urban society.",6
482,We have all heard the prophets of social and moral decay recalling the days when such ‘senseless and mindless’ violence did not exist.,6
483,Our discussion will be divided into two main parts.,6
484,"Firstly, we will look at the history of delinquency and will refer in some detail to recent study,, and his attempt to locate the supposed ‘golden age’ of a traditional way of life based on respect for law and order and all forms of authority.",6
485,"Secondly, we will look at modern delinquency, and specifically football hooliganism.",6
486,A history of delinquency,6
487,"In a journey back through the history of crime and delinquency, Pearson shows that for generations Britain has been plagued by the same problems and fears as today.",6
488,"Yet, the myth that Britain has historically been a stable, peaceful and law-abiding nation, and that violence is somehow foreign to the national character, shows little sign of waning.",6
489,"Pearson searches for the period when such a stable, traditional way of life supposedly held sway.",6
490,"He found this ‘golden age’ was always just over the horizon, one generation further back (see Reading 3, Chapter 5).",6
491,The most striking aspect of the history of delinquency is the consistency with which each generation characterises the youth of the day and the way of life of twenty years previously.,6
492,"So let us start with present-day society and compare it with the situation twenty years or so ago, and then compare that generation with its predecessor.",6
493,"Although there are bound to be difficulties in comparing different ages and periods, different definitions of crime, different measuring techniques and a lack of adequate records and poor communications in previous times, an impression of the style and extent of crime — and of the popular concern about it — can nevertheless be formed.",6
494,Pearson's study starts with present-day attacks on our ‘permissive age’ by contemporary public figures and ‘guardians of morality’.,6
495,"In March 1982 the suggested that ‘we need to consider why the peaceful people of England are changing…over the 200 years 1945, Britain became so settled in internal peace’.",6
496,We have warnings of a massive degeneration among the British people which is destroying the nation.,6
497,"Kenneth Oxford, the Chief Constable of Merseyside, prophesies that ‘the freedom and way of life we have been accustomed to for so long will vanish’.",6
498,There are numerous instances of such statements from prominent  and public figures alleging that contemporary society is witnessing an unprecedented increase in violence and decline in moral  standards.,6
499,"There is a consistent view that Britain's history has been characterised by stability and decency, and that the moderate ‘British way of life’ is being undermined by the upsurge in delinquency.",6
500,"Twenty years previously, however, we can find remarkably similar comments.",6
501,At the Tory Party conference in 1958 there was discussion about ‘this sudden increase in crime and brutality which is so foreign to our nature and our country’.,6
502,The Teddy Boys were arousing similar apocalyptic warnings of the end of British society.,6
503,"Rock and roll was the musical focus of this youth subculture, and the reaction which the Teddy Boys engendered was one of outrage and panic.",6
504,"The press, , printed sensational reports of the happenings at cinemas and concerts featuring rock and roll films and music.",6
505,An article in the of 1954 suggested that ‘Teddy Boys…are all of unsound mind in the sense that they are all suffering from a form of psychosis.,6
506,"the birch or the rope, the gravity of their crimes, what they need is rehabilitation in a psychopathic institution’.",6
507,"This reaction was widespread, off-duty  were banned from wearing Teddy Boy suits and Teddy Boys were viewed by the rest of society as ‘folk devils’.",6
508,"Nowadays, when we look back at old photographs and films of the 1950s rock and roll craze, and the Teddy Boys, it is easy to wonder what all the fuss was about.",6
509,"In comparison to groups who have come since then, they look quite straight.",6
510,"If anything, Teds are remembered with a degree of nostalgia and viewed as something quaint.",6
511,Quite a contrast with the reaction in the mid-1950s illustrated above.,6
512,Could it be that pre-war Britain was  by law-abiding youth and stability?,6
513,"The Second World War has been seen by some as a kind of watershed, with the post-war period being morally inferior to the ‘full rich back street life and culture of pre-war England’.",6
514,"However, when we look more closely at this period familiar declarations and allegations appear.",6
515,In the 1930s there was a similar bemoaning of the ‘passing of parental authority’ and the ‘absence of restraint’.,6
516,The targets of criticism have a common ring — football rowdyism and the increasing crime and disorder.,6
517,In the 1920s there were fierce street battles in North London between Spurs and Arsenal fans.,6
518,"It is sometimes implied that such incidents, and delinquencies , have become more ‘serious’ or ‘violent’over time.",6
519,The evidence  would not seem to back up such suggestions.,6
520,"Crime in Me inter-war years was characterised by razor gangs, feuds between armed gangsters, vice rackets .",6
521,Moving back to the turn of the century and the pre-First World War period we seem little nearer to finding the traditional way of life based on a ‘healthy respect for law and order’.,6
522,A wide range of popular culture came under severe criticism in the early twentieth century.,6
523,"The music halls, professional football and the noisy presence of working-class people at seaside resorts on bank holidays were all attacked.",6
524,"As ever, youth of the period were compared unfavourably with previous generations.",6
525,"Baden Powell in his , published in 1908, suggests that professional football was betraying the British traditions of ‘fair play’ and sportsmanship:",6
526,"Thousands of boys and young men, pale, narrow-chested, hunched-up, miserable specimens, smoking endless cigarettes, numbers of them betting, all of them learning to be hysterical as they groan and cheer in panic unison with their neighbours — the worst sound of all being the hysterical scream of laughter that greets any little trip or fall of a player.",6
527,"One wonders whether this can be the same nation which had gained for itself the reputation of being a stolid, pipe-sucking manhood, unmoved by panic or excitement, and reliable in the tightest of places.",6
528,"Neither does Victorian Britain provide any comparative baseline of a tranquil, law-abiding society.",6
529,The first ‘Hooligans’ of the 1890s and the ‘Garotters’of the 1860s do little to kindle nostalgia for Victorian city life and culture.,6
530,In was in the late 1890s that the words ‘Hooligan’ and ‘Hooliganism’were used to describe delinquent youth.,6
531,"There were regular news reports of Hooligan gangs smashing up coffee-stalls and public houses, robbing and assaulting old ladies, attacking foreigners and setting upon policeman in the streets.",6
532,"later youth subcultures and gangs, Hooligans had a distinct style of dress, and a recognisable look.",6
533,"As with so many of the later youth subcultures, there was an over reaction to Hooligans.",6
534,"Nevertheless, whether correct or not, there was a widely held feeling that hooliganism was a major problem.",6
535,"Earlier in the Victorian period, in the winter of 1862, panic swept through respectable London over a new variety of crime  called ‘garotting’, a type of violent robbery that involved choking the victim.",6
536,A Victorian parallel with present-day ‘mugging’ perhaps.,6
537,"The press reacted in familiar manner, with observing that it was ‘becoming unsafe for a man to traverse certain parts of London at night’.",6
538,The possibility that it was industrialisation that destroyed the stable and peaceful life of pre-industrial Britain does not appear to hold up either.,6
539,"Certainly, in the mid-nineteenth century it was widely felt that life in the previous century had been greatly superior and that the increase in juvenile crime was a blot on this age.",6
540,"However, writing in 1751 Henry Fielding paints a very similar picture with his prediction of an imminent slide into anarchy when the streets of the cities ‘will shortly be impassable without the utmost hazard’.",6
541,"It is difficult to find evidence that there has been massive deterioration in the morality and behaviour of the common people, in comparison to the preindustrial work.",6
542,"From the late seventeenth century there had been complaints of increasing wickedness, crime and disorder.",6
543,"The streets of pre-industrial London were very dangerous, and there was no effective system of street-lighting nor a police force.",6
544,Pearson also examines the recurrent nature of different explanations of the criminal question.,6
545,a permissive present is contrasted with the not too distant past.,6
546,"If such accusations are accepted, we would be forced to conclude that with each generation crime and disorder increase dramatically.",6
547,"Looking back over Pearson's historical review, it is hard to believe that Britain's cities are any more perilous today than those of pre-industrial times, or when they were frequented by gangs of Garotters and Hooligans.",6
548,"This is not to deny, , that crime and violence in contemporary society is an important social reality.",6
549,"However, the preoccupation with violence and lawlessness is part of a long and continuous tradition, a new and unique phenomenon.",6
550,"It is well nigh impossible to compare the rate of crime over extended periods of time (as Reading 10, Chapter 5, taken from Pearson's study, indicates).",6
551,"What we can say, though, is that juvenile crime and street violence have been characteristics of British society over hundreds of years, being indicative of a contemporary moral and social disintegration.",6
552,This does not make it any the less disturbing and below we will discuss contemporary styles of delinquency in greater detail.,6
553,Delinquency in contemporary society,6
554,"Although violence at seaside resorts on bank holidays appears frightening enough when described by the media, various studies have pointed to the ritualistic character of this and other delinquent activity.",6
555,"suggests that teenagers behave the way they do at the seaside, or at football matches, because they are looking for a memorable experience to balance the boredom of the rest of their lives.",6
556,"However, teenagers do not go out saying to themselves that they are going to smash a couple of telephone boxes or fight another group of teenagers.",6
557,"They will not know what they are going to do, and will probably end up doing nothing.",6
558,"Certainly there is fighting and delinquency at seaside resorts and elsewhere, but if teenagers were seeking real violence then the  would be enormous.",6
559,As Corrigan puts it: ‘The kids are not crazy.,6
560,They don't want to get stabbed…or sent away for six months.,6
561,What they want a gang fight is a nice big bruise…that they can show around during the week.’,6
562,"However, whether ritualistic or not, juvenile delinquency is widespread.",6
563,The issue we will examine is why delinquency is so attractive to some and unappealing to other youth.,6
564,", we will look at why the delinquent response is attractive to working-class male youth.",6
565,"In his study of working-class boys in the north-east of England, Corrigan looks at how and why many of these boys get into trouble and engage in delinquent activities.",6
566,"All of the youths studied were in their last year of school, and all were going to leave at the minimum school leaving age (Corrigan, 1979).",6
567,"The leisure activities of these youths centred on the ‘street’, the arena where most illegal activity takes place, where most of the fighting and thieving occurs.",6
568,"They made little use of the youth clubs and other leisure facilities, as places to meet their mates.",6
569,"As previous research into juvenile delinquency has found, spare time activities are carried out in groups.",6
570,In virtually every interview in Corrigan's study the immediate response to the question ‘What do you do on Saturday night?’ was to mention the ‘mates’.,6
571,"So, delinquency, the two important factors would seem to be the street and the group.",6
572,"The major activity of the youths seemed to be ‘doing nothing,, and when asked what they did on the street that was the standard  reply.",6
573,", they were doing something, standing around on comers in groups , but as far as the boys were concerned nothing memorable seems to happen to them on Saturday night.",6
574,"When asked a question ‘What do you do?’, it is implied that something more should be going on, that standing around on a comer must be a means to an end.",6
575,"However, standing on street comers or walking around is not done with any definite end in mind.",6
576,"Nevertheless, between the general walking around, carrying on and joking things emerged that the youths called ‘ideas’, and these ideas formed the basis of group actions.",6
577,The development and carrying such ideas is one of the most active parts of the general ‘hanging around’.,6
578,It is these ideas that lead to what is seen as juvenile delinquency.,6
579,"They are born boredom, and a good idea must contain the chance of excitement (Reading 4, Chapter 5 is taken from Corrigan's examination of the street based leisure/delinquent activities of these working-class youths).",6
580,"Another common diversion is getting into a fight, and, again within the context of ‘doing nothing’ these fights are important and exciting occasions.",6
581,They are not particularly violent fights and participants are rarely hurt.,6
582,"When asked, ‘What sort of fights?’, one of the lads replied, ‘Well, not real fights, as some of them might be quite matey…when you put the boot in, you put the boot in, but we are friendly after, like’.",6
583,"The youths studied — and you might like to consider the extent to which their experiences and expectations are commonplace — and are aware that in their leisure time they are doing nothing, are bored with it.",6
584,"Essentially they want something to happen, and their street activity can best be understood as an attempt to maximize the chances of something interesting happening.",6
585,"Although the street activity is seen as boring, there is always the chance that something will happen the following night or week.",6
586,"The delinquency undertaken by these youths is the result of certain actions which they feel are not very remarkable, based around the search for a bit of interest and excitement.",6
587,Football hooliganism,6
588,"Professional football matches offer contemporary youth, particularly working-class youth, an opportunity to identify with as a solid group in opposition to other such groups.",6
589,"It  offers an opportunity to engage in group delinquency and, occasionally, in group fights.",6
590,"And as we saw in our review of the history of delinquency, this has been the case throughout this century.",6
591,"Football hooliganism is not a particularly new phenomenon, nor is it a peculiarly British problem, it has occurred all over the world.",6
592,"Research into football hooliganism by from Leicester University suggests that many of the common explanations for hooliganism, alcohol, violence on the pitch, the lack of all-seater stadiums, are too simplistic.",6
593,The fact that the problem has persisted throughout this century indicates that its roots are deeper.,6
594,Hooligan fans are predominantly from lower working-class backgrounds.,6
595,One of the characteristic features of their communities is the street-based group activity.,6
596,Such communities emphasise the ties of territory and the ability to ‘defend’ it.,6
597,"Also, due to increasing media attention, delinquent-prone youths who are more interested in fighting than football see the terrace ‘ends’ as places to maintain and improve tough reputations.",6
598,"Just as rival groups from different parts of a town or different estates will defend their areas, so they will join together to defend their ‘end’ of the football ground from fans from other towns.",6
599,"In fact, the chants and taunts of supporters are as much about the merits and demerits of the areas or towns as about the particular teams.",6
600,"Arsenal, , sing ‘Maybe it's Because I'm a Londoner, and Leeds United chant ‘York-shire’, with both sets of supporters mimicking the other's accents.",6
601,"At international level, such local support is subordinated to the national reputation and hooligan fans from different clubs will join forces.",6
602,"Certainly, the fans of the English national team have earned an unenviable reputation around the football-playing world.",6
603,"While football hooliganism is not solely an ‘English disease’, to be an English supporter at a match abroad clearly has a powerful image that attracts many young fans, an image which sees local fans and passers-by retreating in terror, and which has, it must be said, little to do with the achievements of the English football team itself.",6
604,"As Williams and colleagues indicate, the struggle for national pride can be exciting and intoxicating, especially in comparison to the everyday life of most of the hooligan fans.",6
605,"To return to football hooliganism in Britain itself, it is clear  that the existence of ‘ends’ at football grounds all over the country plays a central part in maintaining working-class boys' street-based culture.",6
606,What goes on at these ‘ends’ is intelligible only to those involved.,6
607,"People from a wide range of social backgrounds go to watch football, but their interest and involvement will not be the same as the hooligan fans.",6
608,"As Corrigan puts it, the young supporter ‘knows that a crowd of teachers chanting ‘We hate Nottingham Forest'’ is just not on'.",6
609,"Violence at football matches has been explained the changing nature of the game itself and of the relationship between football clubs, and their players, and the communities in which they exist.",6
610,"The close identity between fans and their club has weakened as football has become big business and as the players, who were once from the same working-class community as the fans, have become rich superstars.",6
611,"Thus, it has been suggested that the attempts to re-organise football in a more businesslike manner, to make it more professional, have alienated young working-class fans from their football clubs.",6
612,Hooliganism on the terraces can be seen as an organised resistance to such changes.,6
613,"Chanting, taking territory and violence have extended the contest of the game onto the terraces.",6
614,"From this viewpoint, football violence has been given a new meaning since the early 1960s.",6
615,"It is a sign of the young fans commitment to their side's cause, and also an attempt to resist changes in the organisation of football.",6
616,"The changing relation of football, and the football club, to working-class culture is seen as an aspect of the wider decomposition of the traditional working-class community.",6
617,"However, this sort of explanation does not seem to hold up in the face of evidence that football hooliganism is a uniquely modern, post-1960 occurrence.",6
618,"The history of Glasgow Rangers Football Club, , makes it clear that riots, violence and vandalism have been well-established since the 1870s.",6
619,This suggests that theories linking football hooliganism to changes in working-class community life are based on a somewhat dubious history.,6
620,"Working-class community life is as strongly established in Glasgow as anywhere, and football violence has occurred there for over a century.",6
621,"Similarly, in England football hooliganism has a long history.",6
622,In the twenty years the First World War there were numerous incidents of football hooliganism.,6
623,The Football Association recorded 116 occasions between 1894 and  1914 when English league clubs were disciplined for trouble at their grounds.,6
624,"These occasions would clearly refer only to the more serious incidents where the Football Association felt it necessary to discipline clubs formally, and many more examples of hooliganism can be found in the newspapers of the period.",6
625,"Such evidence indicates that a whole range of disorderly behaviour occurred at football grounds during this period — missile throwing, pitch invasions and other supposedly ‘contemporary’ phenomena.",6
626,Let us look more closely at the football hooligans themselves.,6
627,"A study of the fans of Oxford United and Millwall found that actual physical violence played only a small part in life on the terraces (, 1978).",6
628,This study centred on the group nature and aspects of football support and of delinquency at football matches.,6
629,"As we have seen, the sense of territory is a crucial aspect of this behaviour.",6
630,"Each football ground has a distinct area or ‘end’ for the (generally young) home supporters, and these ends acquire distinctive names — the North Bank of Arsenal, The Stretford End of Manchester United, .",6
631,The distinctive nature of the ends is reinforced by the fact that the occupants are often physically con fined to the particular area for the whole of the football match.,6
632,"In more and more grounds, fences and grilles have been built around the ‘ends’ and the areas set aside for the visiting supporters, further highlighting the sense of territory.",6
633,Marsh and colleagues found that there was a clear and established career structure among the youths on the terraces.,6
634,"To begin with, there were the ‘Novices’, young boys of around 9, 10 and 11, who stood at the front of the ‘end’ and whose major occupation consisted of watching the activities of the older youths behind them.",6
635,"Then there were the ‘Rowdies’, boys of 15 and 16, who were the most identifiable group by virtue of their appearance, the noise they made and their tendency to run around the most.",6
636,"Lastly, were the ‘Town Boys’, older boys and young men the age of 25 or so, who had previously demonstrated their ‘worth’ in the Rowdies; who rested on their reputations but would still participate in acts of violence if called upon.",6
637,"Eventually, this group would move to other parts of the ground to watch the match with wives and girl-friends.",6
638,In this division or career framework it is the Rowdies who are the typical football hooligans.,6
639,"Within this group there are a series of  distinct and specialised roles, ‘chant leader’, ‘aggro leader’ or ‘nutter’.",6
640,The fact that such roles are well established would seem to demonstrate that football fans ‘Rowdies’ cannot be viewed simply as a bunch of disordered maniacs.,6
641,"The group is ordered and structured, as are its activities.",6
642,", the members of the Rowdies group were well aware of their positions, and where they stood was clearly defined.",6
643,This career framework should not be seen as being wholly rigid or fixed.,6
644,It is only used as a pattern for understanding the organisation of terrace life for young supporters.,6
645,Many fans drift into and groups making a gradual progress.,6
646,"Furthermore, the fans themselves, although recognising the different types of football supporter, will not think a career structure.",6
647,"Nevertheless, the notion of career structures can help to explain behaviour which might otherwise appear irrational and disorganised; it places the activity of the individual within the wider context of age and class dimensions.",6
648,The activities of delinquent fans might be more intelligible if they can be related to particular roles and positions other fans.,6
649,"To summarise, the seemingly disordered nature of football hooliganism can be seen as conforming to a distinct and orderly system of roles, rules and shared meanings.",6
650,What the football terraces offer young working-class males is a chance to escape the boring world of their everyday life.,6
651,They see the terraces as potentially dangerous and exciting.,6
652,"However, these fans know that the terraces are not really dangerous, thus this sense of adventure and danger has to be constructed and exaggerated.",6
653,This exaggerations is well illustrated in a visit by Oxford United fans to the ground of their arch-rivals Swindon Town.,6
654,"The fans knew that very little had happened at the match, but on the way picture, aided by songs, ‘We took Swindon and all of them in it, We took Swindon in half a minute…’",6
655,By the time the coach arrived back at Oxford the day had been made remarkable and worthy of being talked about.,6
656,", the fact that structure and rules are to be found within the behaviour of football hooligans does not mean that there are no problems at football terraces and that such behaviour is to be condoned.",6
657,"We are not trying to excuse the  behaviour, but to explain it.",6
658,Social order can be found in events that are generally seen as dangerous and irrational.,6
659,Crime as a working-class phenomenon,6
660,"This section will question the presumption that crime is overwhelmingly perpetrated by the working classes, or that the ‘real’ and serious crimes are those which are typically committed by this group — crimes like burglary, robbery and vandalism.",6
661,The official criminal statistics present a picture of crime as being predominantly a working-class phenomenon.,6
662,"However, these statistics probably underestimate the extend of middle and upper-class criminality to a much greater extent than they underestimate crime .",6
663,"While prosecuted crime may be largely working class, whether crime as a wider category is so is rather  , a large amount of middle and upper-class criminality goes undetected.",6
664,"Moreover, it is detected, it is often not formally and legally dealt with (the middle class bias in criminal statistics will be discussed in more detail in Chapter Four).",6
665,Crimes which are committed by those in higher positions in the social stratification system are commonly referred to as .,6
666,"Originally the term referred to ‘business, crime, but is now generally attributed to any crimes of the middle classes.",6
667,Edwin Sutherland's famous pioneering work in 1940 produced evidence that white-collar crime might be substantially underestimated in official criminal statistics.,6
668,"He found that petty crimes of stealing from work, and the more major crimes of bribery and corruption, often passed unnoticed or were dealt with informally and unofficially by firms.",6
669,"White-collar crime appeared to be a normal and accepted part of business practice, being both very costly and highly organised.",6
670,"Virtually all the largest American corporations broke the law in one way or another; laws controlling pollution, the adulteration of products, the regulating of prices were ignored and broken at will.",6
671,"The work of Sutherland, and later writers, clearly makes it difficult to identify crime with lower social status, with poverty, social problems and the like.",6
672,"Criminality is also linked with power, respectability and wealth.",6
673,"Below we will concentrate on  an examination of corporate, business crime, the law-breaking of businesses and corporations.",6
674,Such crimes will be used to illustrate the massive and largely unrealised extent of the ‘crimes of the powerful’.,6
675,"We will also look briefly at the more trivial, but widespread, crimes of employee theft —‘fiddling at work’— as an example of another aspect of work-related crime.",6
676,Crimes of the powerful: corporate crime,6
677,"The fact that criminality is linked with respectability and power is central to Marxist-based studies, those of Chambliss (see Chapter 2).",6
678,"In his book ,examines the social character of crime networks in Seattle, USA (Chambliss, 1978).",6
679,"His conclusion is that the forces behind organised crime in America are leading members of the ruling group, and the book's subtitle is ‘From Petty Crooks to Presidents’.",6
680,Chambliss's evidence is based on several years' participant observation in Seattle.,6
681,"After ‘hanging around’ bars in which gambling, drug and vice connections might be made and being involved with card schools, Chambliss found various contacts with inside knowledge.",6
682,"It was from these informants that he pieced together a picture of organised crime as being controlled by key personnel in the police force, local government, business and the legal profession.",6
683,He goes on to argue that the emergence of organised crime networks is bound to happen in a capitalist system.,6
684,"Such a system stresses economic self-interest as all-important, community spirit, public duty ; everybody is out for what they can get.",6
685,"Looking at corporate crime generally, it is noticeable how such crime is greatly under-reported in the media, ‘conventional’ crime.",6
686,"The most popular television crime series, , tend not to deal with corporate crime and the business criminal.",6
687,"being neglected in popular entertainment, this type of crime has also been neglected as an area of study.",6
688,"It is not difficult to see why corporate crime has not received the same publicity as murder, robbery, theft, rape — both in the mass media and in the study of crime.",6
689,"Corporate crime is not visible in the way that ‘conventional’ crime is, the complex nature of such crime and the  ineffective laws and minimal punishments associated with it.",6
690,"Moreover, those who suffer from the effects of corporate crime, the victims, tend to remain unaware that they have been victimised.",6
691,"Their misfortune is often put down to being ‘'s fault, or an accident.",6
692,"In his recent study of the links between power and crime,states that corporate crime is crime committed for the corporate organisation and not against it (Box, 1983).",6
693,"Thus, employee theft, including crimes of fraud against one's employer and embezzlement, are not included in his discussion of corporate crime.",6
694,"Corporate crime, then, refers to illegal acts (including acts of omission) of an individual or group within a legitimate formal organisation which are the goals of that organisation.",6
695,"They must have some detrimental effect, either physical or economic, on employees, consumers or the general public.",6
696,"That definition, which is taken from Box's study, is rather long-winded, but corporate crime is a complex issue.",6
697,The easiest way to understand the nature and extent of this type of crime is to look at some examples of the effect of specific corporate crimes.,6
698,"Firstly, we should make the point that crime does not have to be intentional.",6
699,Very serious consequences can and do follow from people or organisations being indifferent to the results of their actions.,6
700,"Indifference intention may be the cause of greater human suffering, particularly corporate crime.",6
701,"It could be argued, in fact, that being indifferent to the consequences of one's actions indicates a high degree of contempt for (other) people.",6
702,It is important to realise that the law-breaking of large businesses and corporations can have severe consequences.,6
703,It does not just refer to ‘sharp business practices’ and people making slightly greater profits than they should.,6
704,There are numerous cases of corporate crime causing injury and death.,6
705,To cite one example given by Box:,6
706,"Early in 1979, fifty people lost their lives as a result of an explosion aboard the tanker whilst it was anchored at Bantry Bay in County Cork.",6
707,"An Inquiry headed by an Irish High Court Judge, Mr Justice Declan Costello, firmly placed the responsibility for this on two corporations, Total and Gulf, who deliberately decided not to carry out necessary repair  work costing a mere £130,000 because they intended to sell the tanker.",6
708,It is very difficult to assess accurately the costs of corporate crime.,6
709,The economic costs are almost incomprehensibly large.,6
710,"It is not easy to grasp the financial significance of organisations diluting their products, , many millions of customers are paying a few pence extra for their goods.",6
711,"While the few pence — or less — extra for the individual customer might seem insignificant, an organisation may be making a massive illegal profit.",6
712,All studies of the economic costs of corporate crime agree that individuals are deprived of far more money by such crime than by the more conventional crimes of robbery and theft.,6
713,"There are also social costs which are, again, immeasurable.",6
714,"corporate crime undermining the public's faith in the business world, it is also likely that crimes of bribery and corruption by large corporations affect the poorer, less powerful sections of society more than other sections.",6
715,"Powerful business institutions operate in a way that ensures their interests are given priority, the interests of the less powerful sectors of the community.",6
716,"In general terms, then, corporate crime involves robbing the poor to benefit the rich.",6
717,It rewards those who put self-interest the public interest.,6
718,", corporate crime is actually carried out by individuals; organisations cannot themselves plan and commit crimes.",6
719,Businessmen who commit corporate crime are not forced to do so.,6
720,They will be able to weigh up the advantages of breaking a law and not doing so; and they will tend to choose the former path if it seems likely to secure economic and career advancement.,6
721,"One corporate lawyer said that he went producing false insurance policies without thinking anything of it, ‘It was something the company needed done, that's all’.",6
722,"There are instances where individuals are caught between their conscience and the corporate policy, and occasionally between their conscience and their jobs.",6
723,"In explaining why he had gone ‘doctoring’ data to secure a contract deadline, a supervisor pointed out, ‘If I refused to take part in the fraud, I would have to either resign or be fired’.",6
724,"the control of corporate crime, there is little to deter the corporate criminal.",6
725,Many such crimes are looked into by special regulatory bodies the police.,6
726,"In the UK, there are factory inspectorates, railway inspectorates, monopolies and mergers commissions.",6
727,"Although such bodies have the power to recommend criminal prosecution, they are mainly concerned with the inspection and regulation of organisations.",6
728,"There is a fraud squad within the police force, but the majority of their work is concerned with employee theft crimes committed by and for business organisations.",6
729,"Furthermore, the typical penalties for those individuals and organisations who are found guilty of corporate crime do little to deter the would-be criminal.",6
730,", the skilful corporate law-breaker or law-bender will often be able to discover new schemes to avoid or get round criminal laws that are introduced to regulate particular corporate activities.",6
731,Laws introduced to regulate corporate behaviour differ from most criminal laws they do not centre on the results of the breaking of the particular regulation.,6
732,"To give an example, a company was found responsible for a hoist accident at a power station in Kent in 1978 in which four people died and five were seriously injured.",6
733,"However, the company was not prosecuted for the fact that four people died, but because the machinery was not properly maintained; they were fined £5,000.",6
734,In conventional crime one is charged with the results of one's actions.,6
735,"As Box puts it, a person accused of stabbing someone is not likely just to be charged with ‘carrying an offensive weapon’.",6
736,"This is not to say that businessmen should be responsible for all the indirect effects of their policies and actions, or that, , the individuals in the company responsible for the hoist accident described above should be charged and sentenced for murder.",6
737,"The point is that as the laws do not focus on the results of corporate crime, the corporate criminal need only worry about relatively lenient punishment for breaking a particular regulation, and not be concerned with the wider consequences of that action.",6
738,"In concluding his discussion of corporate crime, Box raises the question of whether it can be justified to send thousands of people to prison each year because they are too poor to pay fines (in 1981, 20,000 males were imprisoned for defaulting on fine payments) when their crime is trivial in the extreme corporate crime.",6
739,"While the powerful seem to get away with serious crimes, the powerless commit less serious offences and get prison.",6
740,"Concluding our discussion of corporate crime, the existence of criminal corporations should also be mentioned.",6
741,"crime for corporations and crimes corporations (employee theft), there are corporations deliberately set up for the sole purpose of committing criminal activity.",6
742,"A study of long-firm fraud, one form of corporate crime, by Levi illustrates this type of criminal activity (Levi, 1981).",6
743,Long-firm fraud: an example of corporate crime,6
744,Over the past fifty years there has been a massive expansion in the extent and importance of fraud.,6
745,"Frauds comprise almost 5% of all recorded indictable (serious) crime in England and Wales, compared to only 0.5% in 1928.",6
746,This expansion has imposed a strain on the control of fraud.,6
747,In the metropolitan police there is only one fraud squad officer for every hundred officers.,6
748,"Moreover, fraud trials generally take longer than other criminal trials, the sophisticated and complex nature of many frauds, and they often stretch over many months.",6
749,Levi defines long-firm fraud as referring to businesses which order substantial quantities of goods on credit at a time when the owners of the business either intend not to pay for them or suspect that they will not be able to pay for them.,6
750,"The first record of the term ‘long-firm fraud’ which Levi uncovers was in a journal of 1869, while the obtaining of goods under the false pretence that one had an honest and solvent business is an activity with a much longer history.",6
751,"Long-firm frauds are to be found in most western countries, and are liable to occur wherever there is extensive use of credit in business transactions.",6
752,"Levi classifies various sub-types of such fraud, although for our purposes we will look at this type of corporate crime in general terms.",6
753,The background of long-firm fraudsters is far more varied than is found with convicted criminals as a whole.,6
754,They include businessmen who have never before committed any substantial crime; people who make their living principally from fraud; and other professional criminals who engage in a range of crimes of which long-firm fraud is one.,6
755,"The precise details and mechanics of long-firm fraud vary from case to case, and many are exceedingly complex.",6
756,The basic pattern nevertheless remains the same.,6
757,Looking at an example of  one such fraud will indicate this basic procedure.,6
758,The success of the fraudster often hinges on the ability to tell a convincing story.,6
759,In the 1960s a man with an American accent arrived at a coastal resort in South Wales and announced that he represented an American corporation which wished to purchase a leisure and amusement arcade in the town.,6
760,He offered a generous price which the owners of the arcade accepted.,6
761,"However, he explained that the money was temporarily tied up.",6
762,"While waiting for this money to come through, he asked the owners if they would allow him to order goods for the coming summer season.",6
763,They agreed to this and even gave him their headed notepaper to use in ordering.,6
764,"He wrote to various suppliers implying that he owned the arcade and obtained around £350,000 worth of goods on credit.",6
765,One night all these goods were secretly taken away and disappeared .,6
766,The man's identity has never been discovered.,6
767,"to become a successful fraudster, these skills of being able to present a convincing front and remain calm under pressure have to become almost second nature.",6
768,"As we suggested above, long-firm frauds can be carried out by people who have no social or business contact with the criminal fraternity.",6
769,"Like most upper-class criminals, the ‘businessman-fraudster’ can make large amounts of money from crime without every becoming a known or convicted criminal.",6
770,"The initial motivations that lead a previously ‘honest’ businessman to commit a long-firm fraud are liable to be financial, perhaps a temporary shortage of money.",6
771,"However, the more or less honest businessman who decides to commit a fraud ‘just this once’ may become excited by the fun and challenge of it, by the material pro fits.",6
772,"The reasons given by those who take part in commercial crime straight business tend to stress the pleasure involved in ‘trying to beat the system’, and the battle of wits with creditors, the pleasure that the proceeds of crime bring.",6
773,Fraud is one of the risks which result from the spread of credit.,6
774,"However, fraud is only a minor commercial risk for most suppliers of goods and credit.",6
775,"It does not deter firms from supplying on credit, and there is always insurance cover to fall back on.",6
776,"Thus, although there has been an extension of fraud as credit facilities have expanded, this has not affected the central principle on which the regulation of fraud is based — that at all costs ‘free enterprise’ should not be discouraged by fear of  prosecution.",6
777,The result of this is that the law relating to fraud and commercial affairs is strictly limited in its scope.,6
778,Long-firm fraudsters seem to get treated more leniently by the police and the legal system than do ‘conventional’ criminals.,6
779,"Moreover, the complex nature of many frauds makes it difficult for the police to prepare a sound case.",6
780,"As one officer said to Levi: ‘If we nicked everybody we thought might have done a long-firm, we'd never finish our paperwork, the cases might never come to court, and if they did, they'd never have the room to try them.’",6
781,As far as sentencing is concerned it would seem to be the case that long-firm fraudsters are sentenced on the basis that they are business law-breakers ‘villains’.,6
782,Judges might find it easier to sympathise with and understand such law-breakers in comparison to other types of criminal.,6
783,"Furthermore, there is no shocked outcry from the mass media if such criminals are given relatively minor sentences.",6
784,"The amount of time that even ‘professional’ long-firm fraudsters spend in prison is remarkably small the generally large amounts of money that are obtained from such frauds (Reading 5, Chapter 5, taken from Levi's study, looks at the long-firm fraudster and imprisonment).",6
785,‘Fiddling at work’: employee theft,6
786,"In this section we have concentrated on one type of white-collar crime, corporate crime.",6
787,"Before concluding, it would be useful to refer to the more common crime of employee theft, ‘fiddling at work’.",6
788,"Clearly, the nature oft heft will vary with different types of employment.",6
789,"To gain an impression of the extent of employee theft, we will look at a study of fiddling and pilferage at a medium-sized factory-production bakery in south-east England, undertaken by Jason Ditton (1977).",6
790,The idea that everyone ‘makes on the side’ and ‘has their little perks’was prevalent throughout the factory.,6
791,"As the night manager said, ‘You've got to allow for losses…you get the odd loaf taken home and not paid for’.",6
792,"But always there is the implication that, ‘we all make on the side…know what I mean?’.",6
793,"Ditton worked in the bakery over vacations for a few years and reckoned that each man had an illegal income of about 10 of his bread sales, very little of which appeared as a loss in the firm's financial records.",6
794,"assuming that a few corrupt workers steal large amounts, it would seem more reasonable to contend that many, if not the majority, of employees regularly take small amounts.",6
795,An American firm which used lie detectors on 1400 employees found that 62 admitted petty theft before the tests were administered and a further 14 after.,6
796,This finding has been supported by various other firms and factories.,6
797,"To return to Ditton's study, skill at fiddling customers was a major criteria or unofficial status among the bread salesmen.",6
798,"This fiddling included overcharging, increasing the price of bread to unknowing customers, and keeping the price the same but reducing the size of the bread delivery.",6
799,"Also, the salesmen distinguished between those on their rounds who should not be fiddled (disabled people, ex-salesmen) and those who qualified as ‘fair game’.",6
800,This distinction can be seen as allowing the salesmen to defend themselves through providing a justification for fiddling.,6
801,", this is common to many criminals who define the victim of their criminality as being rich enough to withstand the loss.",6
802,It is almost a Robin Hood notion: ‘you don't feel so guilty with big stores…they allow wastage’.,6
803,"Generally, most of the men did feel some guilt and disliked fiddling, but said, ‘I don't like it but I have to’.",6
804,"On the other hand, this guilt is reduced by counter accusations of ‘they deserve it’ and the like.",6
805,"Furthermore, maxims ‘look after number one’ and ‘it's a dog eat dog world’are taken by fiddlers as principles for action.",6
806,"If it is discovered, employee theft is one of the least stigmatised of crimes.",6
807,"In Ditton's study, the majority of offenders were dealt with quickly and leniently —‘Put that bloody loaf down’ or ‘Don't you try and fiddle me’being examples of reactions.",6
808,The workers who were fiddling at this particular factory were able to keep their self-image and conduct their working lives as good citizens; like most unconvicted white-collar criminals they were not stigmatised.,6
809,Two extracts from Mars' recent study of workplace crime which illustrate the wide range of fiddling at work are included as readings in Chapter 5 (Readings 6 and 7).,6
810,Crime as a male phenomenon,6
811,Here we will examine the supposition — supported by statistics  on sex differences in crime — that crime is characteristically a male activity.,6
812,We will look at sociological explanations for the under-representation of females in criminal activity.,6
813,Table 3.1 below shows the ratio of females to males convicted for certain crimes and makes clear the male domination of criminality.,6
814,Only in the crime of shoplifting does the ratio of females convicted even approach that of males.,6
815,"While the vast majority of offenders are men, a small proportion are women.",6
816,It is sometimes claimed that female criminal activity is restricted to limited types of crimes.,6
817,"However, women do in fact contribute to all kinds of offences.",6
818,"The most common offences for both sexes are crimes against property, with shoplifting being regarded as the ‘typical’ female offence (although adolescent males also indulge in this particular form of crime in significantly high numbers).",6
819,"Women tend to commit few crimes of violence, and those which do occur are mainly committed within the confines of the family.",6
820,"We will break down and discuss two basic, possible explanations for these marked differences between the crime figures for men and women: firstly, that women do not indulge in  criminality to the same extent as men; secondly, that female crime is greatly underestimated by the statistics, in other words there is more female crime than the statistics indicate.",6
821,Women do not indulge in criminality to the same extent as men,6
822,Biological and Psychological arguments,6
823,These arguments suggest that the biological and/or psychological make-up of women does not predispose them to criminality to the same extent as men.,6
824,Until recently differences in the rate of crime between the sexes was generally explained as being biological or psychological differences.,6
825,"Lombroso, whose somewhat bizarre theories of crime and criminals we looked at in Chapter Two, claimed that ‘a delinquent woman is more unnatural than a delinquent man’.",6
826,"He argued that criminals were physically distinguishable by, , large jaws, high cheek bones, extra toes .",6
827,"He found fewer of these traits in women, which led him to assert that women are ‘congenitally less inclined to crime than men’.",6
828,"Furthermore, women who did commit crime were seen as not feminine.",6
829,He suggested that women are by nature passive and therefore less inclined to crime than men — although such a suggestion does not take  of the fact that all crimes involve violence.,6
830,Lombroso's work is dated by Lombroso and Ferrero was originally published in 1895) and largely discredited.,6
831,"However, the biological argument that women are naturally averse to crime and that female criminals are in some way maladjusted has never been fully  .",6
832,"A series of studies, usually by men, have argued that the female biology determines their temperament or personality, and makes women more passive and timid.",6
833,"Female criminals are often seen as suffering from some physical or mental pathology (disease) and the courts still accept the arguments, that female offenders have biological problems, with the menopause, pregnancy, pre-menstrual tension regularly used as explanations or excuses for their criminality.",6
834,"There is little evidence to support such explanations, which are insulting to women they are viewed as faulty  biological mechanisms which spend some of their time malfunctioning.",6
835,There are a number of problems to be found in the attempts to explain the low level of female crime as being physical or mental maladjustment.,6
836,"The female personality is not biologically determined, as researches in different cultures have shown.",6
837,"The female (and male) personality and behaviour is culturally determined, through the socialisation process.",6
838,"Moreover, these interpretations emphasise too heavily individual social causes of crime and delinquency.",6
839,They tend to restrict the causes of criminality to hereditary characteristics and overlook the effects of  influences and cultural traditions.,6
840,"Finally, as we have shown earlier, what is defined as criminal varies across time and place, thus making it difficult to argue that in-built differences between the sexes can explain what is a variable phenomena.",6
841,patterns of socialisation and social control,6
842,The basic argument with which we are concerned here is that the low level of female crime is a result of the expectations and constraints that are placed on women by society.,6
843,"Traditionally, women have been viewed as dependent and passive, and males as aggressive and assertive.",6
844,The socialisation process tends to emphasise these conventional views.,6
845,This is especially the case among the working classes in that working-class females most strongly represent and support traditional sex roles.,6
846,"A study of working-class girls by Sue Sharpe demonstrated that their main aims and priorities were to marry, have children and settle down (Sharpe, 1976).",6
847,"Moves toward emancipation and liberation started, and have largely remained, with middle-class women.",6
848,Different role expectations for men and women lead to different patterns and practices of socialisation.,6
849,"Men, women, learn the skills necessary for certain types of criminal activity.",6
850,"Boys learn how to fight and handle guns, and have the strength required to break into houses.",6
851,"Burglary, , is an untypical female crime, as it requires the criminal to be out alone on the streets at night, and to possess ‘masculine’ skills the ability to force an entry.",6
852,Linked with socialisation is social control.,6
853,There is often stronger social control evident in the socialisation of girls in  comparison to boys.,6
854,"Girls are expected to conform to a stricter morality, by their parents .",6
855,They are likely to be allowed less freedom to go out on the streets and stay out late.,6
856,It is argued that this is a significant factor in reducing the likelihood of girls joining delinquent groups.,6
857,Thus.,6
858,"adolescent boys are out on the streets and more likely to join gangs, and this is where they can become involved in minor law-breaking which may lead to more serious criminality.",6
859,"If it is more heavily impressed on girls that certain types of behaviour are wrong, then they will tend to feel greater apprehension and guilt if they are tempted by delinquent or criminal activities.",6
860,"The basic argument is that the more adolescents are supervised by their parents and, perhaps, their teachers, the less likely they are to become involved with or influenced by delinquent contemporaries and delinquent values.",6
861,Girls are generally more closely controlled and supervised by their parents.,6
862,Hoffman-Bustamente has argued that these differing patterns of socialisation and social control for boys and girls have tended to concentrate those women who do break the law into certain categories of offence.,6
863,", criminal behaviour in women tends to involve non-violent crimes which do not involve the use of physical strength or agility, since women have not been ‘trained’ to develop such skills (Hoffman-Bustamente D.Y., ‘The nature of female criminality’,8, 2, 1973).",6
864,It may be that with greater equality and emancipation the proportion of female criminals will rise.,6
865,As women take greater advantage of educational and occupational opportunities so sex differences in the level of criminal activity may diminish.,6
866,"If this does occur there is a danger that womens' movements will be blamed for the rise in the female crime rate, and that this may be used to argue against further female emancipation.",6
867,"Certainly, there is evidence that the number of women convicted of assaults, woundings and violent crime has risen over the last two decades.",6
868,"Generally, there has been a rise in the female crime rate, especially in the 14–21 age group.",6
869,"However, such statistics can be misleading.",6
870,"It could be that teenage girls nowadays act in a more self-confident manner, and that this fuels notions that they are becoming more violent.",6
871,"This then becomes a , police officers, magistrates and social workers will be more likely to be stricter with female offenders; and thus more females will be convicted of crimes.",6
872,"Although there is no evidence that liberation has led to greater female criminality, such a view is widely held and has been strongly expressed in the popular press.",6
873,"The reported a ‘Crime Wave of the ‘Lib'’ Girls' (1 September, 1975), while the claimed that ‘Women's Lib ‘‘pushes up crime''’(1 February, 1980).",6
874,But it is not just the popular press who have argued such a case.,6
875,"The has asserted that, ‘In recent years we've experienced a new, aggressive, liberated criminality in women’(30 March, 1980).",6
876,"There is not doubt that the behaviour of the police and the courts, the wider public, will be influenced by their image of female crime.",6
877,"If this image has changed the way the media has portrayed female crime, and linked liberation with violent crime, then women are liable to be treated more severely by the police and the courts.",6
878,"This will, , push up the female crime figures.",6
879,Opportunities for crime,6
880,Differing roles without society limit or increase opportunities to commit crime.,6
881,It is still the case that the majority of girls do not see themselves as primarily workers or careerists.,6
882,"As was suggested above, girls have been socialised into viewing work as secondary to marriage and child-rearing.",6
883,"If women's careers and position in society generally con fine them to the home, they will have less opportunity to commit crimes which are associated with work, fraud.",6
884,"Employee theft, after all, is impossible if one is not employed.",6
885,"Because women are largely con fined to jobs with low status and power, they will be relatively less able to engage in serious forms of white-collar and corporate crime.",6
886,", the fact that women are less mobile than men and more confined to the home means that they are less likely to be exposed to situations which lack effective informal social controls.",6
887,In areas where women have similar opportunities to men they appear as likely to break laws.,6
888,"The high incidence of shoplifting among women, , reflects the day-to-day activities in which female criminality is liable to be expressed.",6
889,"In the world of organised, professional crime, sex-segregation is the norm.",6
890,"Women are likely to be viewed traditional sex-role stereotypes, as unreliable, emotional, illogical .",6
891,"Moreover, male criminals tend to see the crimes they commit as  too dangerous for women, or too difficult, or their masculine pride may not be willing to accept women as organisers of crime, as ‘bosses’.",6
892,Female crime is greatly underestimated by the criminal statistics,6
893,The issue here is whether the statistics on female crime provide an accurate picture of the actual extent of such crime.,6
894,There are a number of points and arguments worth considering.,6
895,The more minor crimes are less liable to be known to the police and recorded in the statistics than are serious crimes.,6
896,"Thus, if women tend to commit more minor crimes, they will have a much better chance of avoiding detection.",6
897,"crimes that are known about, the police and courts may be more lenient with female offenders.",6
898,", when deciding whether to caution, arrest or charge an individual, the police may be influenced by the sex of the offender.",6
899,"The stereotypical views held by agents of social control will tend to suggest that women are less delinquent and crime-prone than men, that they are not ‘real’ criminals.",6
900,Females are less likely than males to be labelled as delinquent and to be processed accordingly.,6
901,"Also, the fact that police officers will know that female crime rates are lower than male crime rates will further incline them to the view that women are not by nature ‘criminal types’.",6
902,"If women are convicted of crimes in greater numbers (and, as mentioned, female convictions have increased in recent years), it will be interesting to see how the police and the courts react.",6
903,"The male prison population vastly outnumbers the female; in 1979, 143,000 males spent some time in prison, in comparison to 8,000 females.",6
904,"Thus, if convicted, women are far less likely to be given a custodial sentence.",6
905,"One reason for this is that more women are first offenders, who are generally treated more leniently.",6
906,"However, the reluctance of sentencers to imprison women does not seem to be based on any clear principles, given the supposed principle of equality before the law.",6
907,"An example of this differential sentencing policy was reported in the 18 August, 1980, which quoted a male judge, who told a female  , ‘If you were a man I would send you to prison without hesitation’.",6
908,"The more lenient punishments given to women probably reflect a belief that female crime is a result of  sickness, of some physical or emotional problem, being rational action with specific, often financial, motives.",6
909,"In other words, the old view that women's crime is physically explainable would still appear to be influential, despite the fact that there is no real evidence for such explanations.",6
910,"Another point to consider the statistics on female crime is the view that men may adopt a more chivalrous attitude to women, based on misconceptions of women as passive and gentle.",6
911,"Therefore, the police, magistrates and judges, who are all predominantly male, will tend to leniency.",6
912,"If a woman is tearful and apologetic and can claim some biological disturbance, then she is not likely to be treated as severely as a man.",6
913,"So far we have looked at the view that sex differences affect the way in which the police and the courts act toward offenders, and that this enables women to escape criminalisation to a greater extent than men.",6
914,"However, it has also been argued that women are discriminated against by the agents of the law, just as they are in other areas of life.",6
915,"It is maintained that the courts, , view young females as ‘protection’.",6
916,"Thus, young female offenders are more likely to be placed in protective and custodial institutions than are boys whose delinquent or criminal behaviour is similar.",6
917,Boys are left in the community because they are not felt to need such protection.,6
918,"These arguments, however, refer to the less serious, juvenile criminality.",6
919,They do not necessarily contradict the view that for more serious crimes women are less severely treated then men.,6
920,"As we have mentioned, judges, the police and the public may have more difficulty in understanding serious female crime and tend to believe that the woman offender is not really criminal.",6
921,"Her action is seen as an irrational or emotional response to a particular situation; she ‘only did it for love’, .",6
922,"Overall, however, the bulk of evidence on female crime suggests that sex plays a relatively minor role in determining the response of the legal system.",6
923,There is no clear evidence that women receive massively more favourable treatment from the police or the courts.,6
924,"Thus, we would suggest that these second types of explanation for the differences in the rate of crime between men and women — that female crime exists to a much greater extent than is indicated by the statistics but is just less often recorded — cannot explain the enormous sex differences in recorded rates of crime.",6
925,It would appear that the explanation for the strong link between sex and crime must lie in the wider stratification system in society.,6
926,"Women are far more restricted than men in their access to the reward structure of society, and women are still largely restricted to the private, family sphere.",6
927,"In contrast, crime, when it is recorded, is a public occurrence.",6
928,The continuing importance of sexual divisions in employment and of traditional stereotypes of the woman's role are central to explanations for sexual divisions in the sphere of criminality.,6
929,In this chapter we have looked at specific aspects and illustrations of crime and the study of it.,6
930,In the next chapter we will examine in greater detail the statistics on crime.,6
931,"In doing so we shall return to some of the issues raised above, including the question of class and sex biases in these statistics.",6
932,PART 3 Statistical data and documentary readings,6
933,Measuring crime: criminal statistics,6
934,"In popular debate about crime one issue always comes to the fore: how much crime is there in our society, and is it increasing or decreasing?",6
935,To answer these questions people invariably turn to the official criminal statistics which are collected and published by the Home Office.,6
936,In this chapter we will examine what these statistics show and discuss the extent to which they provide an accurate picture of the range and extent of criminal behaviour.,6
937,"Criminal statistics are usually quoted as ‘hard facts’; , they are accepted unquestioningly, and are often used to support the view that there is a rapidly increasing rate of serious crime in modern society.",6
938,It is also important to recognise that it is on the basis of these statistics that important decisions are made by governments their policies towards crime and its treatment.,6
939,Decisions concerning the most effective and efficient way of allocating resources (of money and manpower) in the attempt to deal with crime-related social problems will be influenced by criminal statistics.,6
940,", in 1980 the Home Secretary, William Whitelaw, introduced the ‘short, sharp, shock’ punishments for young offenders, involving a few months' strict discipline and almost para-military training in detention centres.",6
941,This widely publicised policy was intended to relieve public concern over the rise in violent crimes against persons and property committed by juveniles.,6
942,"However, the questions we should keep in mind during our examination of criminal statistics are whether they really justify such public concern, and, most importantly, what do they tell us?",6
943,"The first section of the chapter will provide an overview  of patterns and trends in criminal behaviour, as indicated by the official criminal statistics.",6
944,In the second section problems associated with the use of these  will be examined.,6
945,The pattern of crime,6
946,"Broadly speaking, the official statistics indicate that there is an increasing rate of crime, and that the increase has accelerated rapidly in the post-war period, especially since the mid-1950s.",6
947,"Figure 4.1 summarises the total number of serious offences per 100,000 of the population for the period 1957 to 1977, and shows a 290 increase over those two decades.",6
948,In 1900 the police in England and Wales recorded crimes for every of the population.,6
949,"By 1974, however, they recorded four crimes for every of the population — a thirteen-fold increase in seventy odd years (Radzinowicz, L. and King, J.,, 1977).",6
950,"While this increase is startling, it is worth noting that a concern over ‘crime waves’, and rising levels of juvenile crime , is not a new phenomenon.",6
951,"In parts of London during the last century, , it was certainly not safe to walk the streets at night, with violence and robbery commonplace, as the stories of Charles Dickens illustrate.",6
952,"So, while criminal statistics have risen substantially, theft and violence is clearly not a modern problem.",6
953,So far as the type of crime committed is concerned throughout this century the great bulk of crime has always involved stealing of one kind or another.,6
954,Simple theft is still the commonest variety of stealing.,6
955,But there have been significant changes in the nature of stealing since the Second World War.,6
956,", there has been a major and disproportionate increase in shoplifting (3 of theft in 1945, compared with 14 in 1978) and in thefts from, and of, motor vehicles.",6
957,"Crimes of violence comprise 4 of recorded crime, and while crimes of violence have risen rapidly in numbers in the post-war period there have been changes in the pattern of such offences.",6
958,"In 1945, 28 of violent crimes against the person were of the most serious nature — serious wounding or homicide — but by 1975 this proportion had dropped to 9 , and by 1979 to 6 .",6
959,The main factor causing this redistribution seems to have been a massive increase in non-serious wounding.,6
960,"Thus, it is indisputable that the volume of crime has risen.",6
961,"However, the statistics indicate that criminal activity is not randomly distributed throughout the whole population, and we need to examine the of recorded crime.",6
962,"the figures, the people most likely to commit criminal offences in Britain live in urban areas, are young, male and working class.",6
963,We will look briefly at each of these elements in turn.,6
964,Urban/rural differences,6
965,"The crime rate is higher in urban areas than it is in rural areas, and the larger the urban area the greater the crime rate is.",6
966,"Thus, London and other large cities have higher rates of crime per 100,000 of population than do smaller and medium-sized towns.",6
967,"However, although the rates of crime in the large cities have always exceeded the rates in rural areas, the increase in crime rates this century has been a universal phenomenon.",6
968,"In other   words, there has been a large proportional increase in recorded crime in all parts of the country, as Table 4.1 illustrates.",6
969,"The figures shows an increase in crime rates for all areas, yet there are curious differences in the extent and timing of the change in such rates in different police forces.",6
970,"The crime rate in Liverpool/ Bootle in 1921 and 1931 was several times the rate in Manchester/ Salford, , but the massive increases in that area between 1938 and 1971 put it above the Liverpool area by 1971.",6
971,"Students might find it useful to examine and discuss the figures in Table 4.1; it should be born in mind, however, that definitions of indictable crimes have changed over time, as we mentioned in Chapter 1.",6
972,"the variations, crime rates are significantly higher in urban areas than in rural areas.",6
973,"This might be the result of a number of factors, assuming, , that urban dwellers are not inherently more devious and criminal than rural dwellers:",6
974,THE ROLE OF OPPORTUNITY,6
975,"Large urban areas afford greater opportunities for criminal activity with the presence of large department stores, warehouses, financial  , large car parks .",6
976,THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COMMUNITY,6
977,It is likely to be easier to commit crime in urban areas in that it is easier to be unnoticed and to remain anonymous in such areas.,6
978,In rural areas there is a tendency for many of the inhabitants to know ; strangers are highly visible and liable to cause suspicion.,6
979,"In urban areas, therefore, the effectiveness of informal  social control is reduced.",6
980,In rural areas it might be that people will tell the parents of youths whom they see committing some offence; and although crimes may be committed they will often be dealt with informally and so will not figure in the criminal statistics.,6
981,POLICE PROCEDURE,6
982,In rural areas the police tend to be more integrated with the community.,6
983,"They are more likely to know offenders personally, or to know their families, and thus to warn ‘book’ offenders.",6
984,"This is, , only a tendency, and the move local policemen to larger, centralised policing may reduce this effect.",6
985,"Reading 9 in Chapter 5, from Cain's study of rural and urban police forces, illustrates very distinctly the differing styles of policing in different areas.",6
986,Age Differences,6
987,"In both sexes criminal activity appears to peak in adolescence and early adulthood — between the ages of 14, and younger, and 21.",6
988,"In 1977, 8 of males aged 14 to under 17 were found guilty of, or cautioned for, offences; 0.7 of the 30+ age group.",6
989,"Similarly, in 1977, 1.6 of females aged 14 to under 17 were found guilty of, or cautioned for, offences; 0.2 of females in the 30+ age group.",6
990,This does not mean that people become more honest as they grow older.,6
991,It is more likely that the types of crime committed by older people will be less noticed and less liable to be recorded in the criminal statistics.,6
992,"Older people spend less time the house, on the street where the bulk of criminal activity occurs.",6
993,"To take a somewhat simplistic example, stealing low-priced goods from shops is more likely to be reported than stealing goods of equal value from one's place of work.",6
994,"Having said that, as the figures given above indicate, the younger age groups, the 14 to under 17's followed closely by the 17 to under 21's, contain far higher proportions of people who are found guilty of, or cautioned for, criminal offences than do older age groups.",6
995,"theft, , in 1970 38 of persons convicted of theft were juveniles (, under 17).",6
996,"However, a couple of points should be made about these statistics.",6
997,"Firstly, the peak age for conviction is around the school-leaving age and the likelihood of conviction after that age declines; and, secondly, a very significant proportion of the offences committed by juveniles are very trivial — stealing milk bottles .",6
998,It is popularly held that juvenile delinquency is on the increase.,6
999,Certainly there have been fears in the media over a ‘new school-age crime wave’.,6
1000,Recent statistics issued by the Metropolitan Police indicated that a quarter of all serious crimes in Greater London are committed by school-children.,6
1001,One arrest in four is of persons aged 10–16 years and half of all arrests are of persons under 21 years.,6
1002,"As we have already pointed out, the crime rate is increasing for all age groups, and there is little evidence that juvenile criminality is increasing at a very much greater rate than crime .",6
1003,"Between 1959 and 1977 the number of offences per 100,000 of the population for males aged 14 to under 17 increased by 148 , compared to a rise of 136 for males aged 21 and over — hardly a massive difference.",6
1004,What seems to have happened over the last twenty years or so is that a higher proportion of juveniles are being dealt with officially by the police being dealt with unofficially or warned.,6
1005,Thus higher proportions of juveniles are figuring in the criminal statistics.,6
1006,Sex differences,6
1007,Criminal statistics in all countries have consistently shown that more males than females appear before the courts and are convicted for criminal activities.,6
1008,"Of all offenders found guilty, in all courts, both magistrate and crown courts, females make up approximately 11 of the total (magistrate courts deal with relatively minor crimes and civil actions, whereas the more serious indictable offences, which can be tried by jury, are dealt with by crown courts).",6
1009,"Females make up an even smaller proportion of the prison population in this country, between 3 and 4 at any one time.",6
1010,"Furthermore, 12 of males compared to 2 of females are found guilty of, or cautioned for, criminal offences by the age of 17.",6
1011,"Statistics also show that while the crime rate has increased regularly for all groups, the rise in female crime has been far  steeper than the rise in male crime.",6
1012,"Between 1959 and 1977, the number of female offenders per 100,000 of the population aged 14 to under 17 increased by 379 (compared to a 148 increase for males of the same age group).",6
1013,For females aged over 21 there was a 281 increase (compared to 136 for males of the same age group).,6
1014,"Although male offenders still heavily outnumber female offenders, these changes have led to an alteration in the male-female ratio for crime and delinquency.",6
1015,Figure 4.2 shows the changed male-female ratio for the 14 to 17 age group.,6
1016,"In 1957 the ratio was 10.79 to 1, but by 1977 it had fallen to 4.97 to 1.",6
1017,"In Chapter 3, we looked at explanations for the differences in male and female criminality.",6
1018,This section has just presented some statistical data on such differences.,6
1019,Class differences,6
1020,The fourth element in the pattern of criminal statistics is that recorded crime is largely a working-class phenomenon.,6
1021,"Although crime occurs across all social classes, and is not just restricted to individuals from working-class backgrounds, official statistics show a clear link between social class and crime.",6
1022,It has been a long and widely held assumption that crime is very much more frequent among those of low social status.,6
1023,"Furthermore, this presumed strong association between crime and social class has been the basis for most of the leading sociological theories of crime.",6
1024,"In our discussion of theories of crime, in Chapter Two, we examined various theoretical approaches which centred on class differences in crime and, , juvenile delinquency.",6
1025,", the Functionalist-based theories see crime and delinquency as a  to frustrations arising from lower social position and status.",6
1026,"Although a range of sociological theories has suggested that crime is deprivation of one sort or another, it is worth stressing that many middle-class children also engage in delinquent behaviour.",6
1027,"A national survey in 1979 found that whereas 22 of boys from ‘lower-manual’ families had been convicted for criminal offences, only 4 of boys from ‘upper-middle’families had been.",6
1028,"This does not necessarily mean that working-class boys commit more delinquencies, but that they are more likely to fall foul of the legal system.",6
1029,"While these figures refer to crimes committed by juveniles, they do give a good indication of the extent of class differences in crime statistics generally, given the high proportion of offenders who are juveniles.",6
1030,"It might be that the reason working-class criminals far outnumber middle-class criminals (proportionately, there are more working-class people in this country) is because middle-class crimes are less regularly recorded and middle-class offenders are less severely punished.",6
1031,This issue of whether there is differential treatment accorded to working and middle-class crime and criminals will be examined in the next section of this chapter.,6
1032,The statistical evidence therefore suggests there is some association between crime and social class.,6
1033,"But whilst this association is most noticeable between the extremes of the social class scale, it is far less marked between the middle groups.",6
1034,"The national survey referred to above, , found that both the ‘lower-middle’ and ‘upper-manual’groups had the same rates of delinquency — 12 .",6
1035,"One final point on the relationship of  social class to crime: it may not be low social class in itself which is associated with crime, but rather that low social class is liable to be linked with other factors, perhaps parental criminality, deprivation or inadequacy of some kind, which might predispose individuals brought up in certain social classes toward criminality.",6
1036,"Having given a brief overview of the social incidence, or the pattern of recorded crime, we will turn now to some of the problems involved in the use of criminal statistics.",6
1037,A critique of official criminal statistics,6
1038,Official crime figures provide a classic example of why social scientists should treat statistics on social problems with suspicion.,6
1039,"As a general point, statistics are social products, they are produced for organisations and governments.",6
1040,"They are often organised and structured in the interests of influential and powerful bodies to make a particular point, perhaps to make a case for more money or resources, or to show a particular body or organisation in a good light.",6
1041,"Although the validity of official crime statistics has been questioned and doubted, they nevertheless provide an important basis for people's ideas about crime and criminals.",6
1042,But in fact there are two major and important  with them.,6
1043,"Firstly, there is the problem of : only a proportion of crimes and offenders are included in the official figures.",6
1044,"Secondly, there is the problem of — those crimes and offenders included in the statistics might not be a representative picture of all crime and of all offenders.",6
1045,"We will consider, firstly, the question of omission; then we will examine the issues concerned with bias in the statistics; and thirdly we will look at attempts to overcome some of the problems with the official criminal statistics.",6
1046,The ‘dark figure’ of unrecorded crime,6
1047,"Criminal acts are defined by the Home Office as ‘those acts against the law for which the offender is caught, tried and found guilty’.",6
1048,This obviously represents only a proportion of criminal activity in Britain since a number of crimes remain undetected and a number of offenders are not convicted.,6
1049,", criminal statistics only show what police forces record, and the police clearly cannot be expected to record the numerous offences which they do not know about.",6
1050,"Criminal statistics, therefore, only indicate the crimes that are reported to the police and recorded by them as crimes.",6
1051,"this, there also exists what is termed a ‘dark figure’ of unrecorded crime.",6
1052,The bulk of this non-recording is crime not being reported to the police.,6
1053,"However, it is also the case that not all events reported to the police as crimes are treated by them, and recorded, as crimes.",6
1054,A significant proportion of crime reports are subsequently written off as ‘no crimes’.,6
1055,"Furthermore, the role of the police is crucial in determining whether offences that they do know about are proceeded against.",6
1056,It is the police who have to decide whether the unruly pickets or drug users they pick up are prosecuted; and if the police took every offender to court the legal system would not be able to cope.,6
1057,Thus recorded crime can only be seen as an indication of criminal activity.,6
1058,One Chief Constable has estimated that only about 10 of all crime is reported to the police.,6
1059,"As you might expect, a much higher proportion of serious crime is liable to be reported to the police and thus recorded.",6
1060,"The reporting rate, and the detection rate, for murder is over 90 , and for serious assault over 80 .",6
1061,"Such crimes are, by their very nature, difficult to hide, and they are crimes to which the police will devote great effort and resources to solve and ‘clear up’.",6
1062,"In contrast, petty theft has a very low rate of reporting to the police, and a low detection rate.",6
1063,"Therefore, the degree to which official statistics underestimate the actual level of crime depends on the particular category of crime.",6
1064,Almost all cars that are stolen are reported for the simple reason that that is the only way owners will get insurance compensation; and insurance is often a major reason for reporting other thefts and burglary.,6
1065,So the extension of insurance provision has led to a greater likelihood of the reporting of many crimes.,6
1066,There are a number of reasons why crimes are not reported to the police and thus not recorded in the official criminal statistics.,6
1067,Below we will suggest and discuss some of these reasons.,6
1068,"Before reading through these suggestions you might like to jot down some of your own ideas, or to discuss possible explanations with colleagues.",6
1069,This list is exhaustive and is only intended to illustrate some of the most commonplace reasons  for the non-reporting of crime.,6
1070,"Firstly, many crimes do not have victims, and only the offender(s) will know that a crime has been committed — , illegal drug use and supply, soliciting by prostitutes or illegal abortion (here we are talking about victims in the conventional sense of a separate and visible victim, although it could be argued that the user of illegal drugs is a victim him or herself, or that the unborn foetus is a victim in the case of illegal abortion).",6
1071,These ‘victimless’ crimes often involve one party or individual providing a service which the other party wants.,6
1072,In the examples given above neither of the parties involved would inform the police; consequently the true numbers of such crimes are never known to the police.,6
1073,The extent to which these crimes are known and recorded will depend almost entirely on police activity and efficiency.,6
1074,"Secondly, embarrassment may be a reason for not reporting a crime; victims may want to hide an offence report it.",6
1075,This is particularly the case with victims of sexual offences.,6
1076,"Rape victims, , may fear the consequences of reporting the act, and may not wish to be cross-examined by the police or in court and be exposed to possible innuendoes and suggestions that they ‘encouraged’ their assailant.",6
1077,Recent court cases where the victims of rape have been seen by judges as contributing to the crime through their ‘negligence’— hitch-hiking alone — are not likely to act as an encouragement for other victims to report such offences.,6
1078,"Thus, very serious crimes might go unrecorded.",6
1079,"Similarly, parents of children who have been victims of sexual offences may not want their child to be interrogated and to go through the trauma of reliving the experience in court.",6
1080,"Thirdly, and linked with the above point, it is sometimes not in the best interest of the victim to report a crime to the police.",6
1081,"Firms may not wish to prosecute an employee who has been fiddling them but may prefer to deal with the matter informally, to avoid bad publicity or appearing inefficient and the Possible loss of the confidence of their clients.",6
1082,"Fourthly, victims may feel that there is no point in informing the police, because there is no chance of getting retribution.",6
1083,"Minor thefts, , may not be reported as the victims feel there is little chance of them getting their goods back or of the offender getting caught.",6
1084,"Fifthly, victims or witnesses of crimes may dislike of not trust the police.",6
1085,Crimes among criminals are not likely to be reported to the police for obvious reasons.,6
1086,"In a similar vein, victims or witnesses may sympathise with the offender, or be unwilling to inform on a member of their family or a friend.",6
1087,Another reason for the non-reporting of crime is that many victims are unaware that they actually are victims of specific crimes.,6
1088,"Firms may be unaware of theft by their employees, and shops will not be aware of particular instances of shoplifting.",6
1089,"Such actions are commonly built into firms' and shops' accounting procedures, as ‘stock shrinkage’ perhaps.",6
1090,"Thus, an unknown but potentially vast amount of crime remains unknown to the police, and is therefore not included in official criminal statistics.",6
1091,"Furthermore, examining recorded crimes only, changes in the figures may be accounted for by reasons the fact that the actual number of offences have changed, and there are a variety of other ways in which an increase in recorded crime can be accounted for.",6
1092,Below we will suggest and examine a number of possible reasons or explanations.,6
1093,"Again, our list is not intended to be exhaustive and you might try to suggest other potential reasons.",6
1094,"Firstly, improved police efficiency will affect the rate of recorded crime.",6
1095,"Better police equipment might lead to more offences being recorded, as might an increase in police numbers, and over the last few years there has been a recruitment drive by the police.",6
1096,"Secondly, and linked with this point, criminal statistics reflect the intensity of law enforcement itself.",6
1097,"The police may respond to pressure to concentrate their time and resources on certain specific areas of criminal activity, often areas which have received heavy coverage in the mass media, football hooliganism or drug use.",6
1098,In such circumstances the figures for those activities will rise as a result of the police having spent more time and money in dealing with them.,6
1099,"Thirdly, an increased willingness the public to report offences will influence the statistics.",6
1100,"There may, , be changes in public opinion towards the police and the reporting of criminal activity.",6
1101,It is also relevant to add that it has become increasingly easy to report matters to the police as a result of the spread of private telephones.,6
1102,"A fourth and very important influence on the rate of recorded  crime is the effect of changes in the law, which may lead to an alteration in the definition of what is or is not a crime.",6
1103,"In general terms, there are far more laws in operation today than in the past, thus there are more laws to be broken.",6
1104,"So legal changes, not merely changes in behaviour, will be reflected in the statistics.",6
1105,"On this point, a central problem with criminal statistics is that they only cover what is officially defined as crime at any one time.",6
1106,"Thus new definitions of crime and new laws raise problems in the comparison of statistics on a ‘before and after’ basis, and thereby lead to problems in talking about rises or falls in crime.",6
1107,"Fifthly, there are greater opportunities for crime in modern society.",6
1108,", the huge increase in the number of motor vehicles has led to a massive increase in auto-crimes.",6
1109,The growth of self-service stores since the Second World War has been important in encouraging shoplifting.,6
1110,It is likely that certain crimes have increased not because people have become more dishonest but because it has become easier to commit such crimes.,6
1111,"Similarly, the much greater availability of illegal drugs has led to a phenomenal growth in drug offences.",6
1112,A final possible reason — which relates to police practice — is that individual police officers may feel under pressure to make arrests to appear efficient and to get on.,6
1113,"As a young policewoman interviewed as part of a recent study on Merseyside's police said, ‘It's always at the back of your mind, you just can't get rid of it.",6
1114,"Oh hell, I've got to do somebody.",6
1115,I've got my progress (report) due’.,6
1116,"(,).",6
1117,So the more closely one looks at the criminal statistics the more complicated and problematic they become.,6
1118,And the more dubious must we be of sweeping generalisations made on the basis of such statistics.,6
1119,"It may be that we are becoming a more ‘criminal’ nation as the increase in crime rates would suggest, but this cannot just be assumed and it is important to be aware of other possible reasons for such an increase.",6
1120,At the same time it is obvious that full enforcement of the law would be totally impractical.,6
1121,The police have to exert some .,6
1122,"If the police recorded and acted on every offence they knew about, they would be overwhelmed with paperwork and the courts would be flooded with cases.",6
1123,"The police officer on patrol has to ask whether it is worth proceeding with and against every suspect, and will often decide it is not worth it.",6
1124,"One of the arguments we  will examine below is the view that the police use this discretion, this freedom to decide when to proceed and when not to, to favour ‘respectable’ and middle-class individuals working-class individuals.",6
1125,The middle-class bias in statistics,6
1126,"questioning the validity and use of official criminal statistics, more fundamental questions their meaning and implications have also been raised.",6
1127,"There is for one thing, that these statistics are incomplete.",6
1128,In developing theories of crime this would not necessarily be important if the figures gave a representative sample of crime and criminals.,6
1129,", if only 10 of crime is recorded in the statistics, but this nevertheless accurately reflects the full range of crime and criminals, then the statistics would provide a representative sample.",6
1130,"However, it has been demonstrated that the official criminal statistics give an unrepresentative and misleading picture of the social distribution of criminal behaviour.",6
1131,"Recent studies of crime, particularly Marxist-based work, have suggested that there is a systematic bias the powerful in the way that the law is applied and enforced.",6
1132,"Broadly speaking, the higher an individual is in the social strata the less likely he or she is to be arrested, prosecuted and (if prosecuted) found guilty.",6
1133,", this is not the same as saying that the rich and powerful never get prosecuted: there are many specific cases which illustrate this point, and which are generally well publicised.",6
1134,"Nonetheless, such instances tend to be exceptions to the rule.",6
1135,The statistics show that recorded crime is predominantly working-class.,6
1136,To assess whether this is an accurate picture it is necessary to address the question whether crime itself is predominantly working-class.,6
1137,The issue to examine is whether the fact that more working-class offenders are caught means that more working-class people break laws.,6
1138,"A number of factors need to be taken into account here, and we will examine some of them below.",6
1139,"Those crimes which are reported are more likely to be committed by the working class because they are more visible, crimes against property.",6
1140,"Middle-class crimes, fraud or embezzlement, are far less likely to be discovered and  reported.",6
1141,"Furthermore, people are more likely to report suspicious circumstances surrounding an individual who appears to be of lower-class origin.",6
1142,"Whether intentionally or not, police procedures may be biased against those of lower social status.",6
1143,When a crime is reported to the police they do not work on the assumption that anyone could have done it.,6
1144,This is not practical or possible.,6
1145,"Therefore, they tend to look for a certain ‘type’.",6
1146,"This is a very important factor because it biases police activity against the poorly spoken, badly dressed and ill-educated individuals who have the least power, and the fewest people of influence to back them up.",6
1147,"There is also an element of bias when the individual comes into contact with the official, whether police officer or magistrate, which has similarities with the relationship between middle-class teachers and working-class pupils.",6
1148,The police tend to operate with different expectations of individuals from different social backgrounds.,6
1149,"They are far more likely to use their discretion when dealing with the middle-class offender, thus the middle-class offender is far less likely to actually come to court.",6
1150,"It is important to bear in mind that there may be a significant amount of delinquency and crime amongst the middle classes, but we are less likely to be made aware of it.",6
1151,‘One law for the rich and another for the poor’ is an old saying which is certainly true of the way the law is enforced.,6
1152,"To provide an illustration, a child who gets into trouble is much more likely to come before a court if he or she is from a poor home and has parents who do not get on with the welfare authorities or the police, than if his or her family is prosperous, respectable and willing to co-operate with the police and social services.",6
1153,"In the last section of this chapter we will examine the attempts that have been made to find out more about the actual extent of crime, and to provide some sort of indication of the ‘dark figure’ of crime and to discover the ‘real’the recorded rate and character of crime.",6
1154,The two major forms such attempts have taken are victim studies and self-report studies.,6
1155,Victim studies and self-report studies,6
1156,"While victim studies and self-report studies overlap to some extent and are sometimes used in conjunction, they are distinct approaches which need to be defined separately.",6
1157,are designed to investigate the number of individuals who have been victims of crime.,6
1158,They ‘took off’ in the mid-1960s in the USA.,6
1159,"A Washington survey, , showed that 38 of those asked revealed that they had been a victim of a serious crime within the last year, compared to the 10 revealed by police statistics.",6
1160,"The purpose of this and of other victim studies was to elicit from respondents whether they had been the victim of a crime, and if so, which types of crime and whether they had reported it to the police.",6
1161,"All victim studies show that police records cover, at the most, about one quarter of the serious crime actually committed.",6
1162,"Such studies do themselves, however, suffer from limitations.",6
1163,", individuals find it difficult to remember how often they have been ‘victimised’, or tend to exaggerate their experiences.",6
1164,"Moreover, while they do show that official statistics tend to underestimate the amount of crime, it is likely that victim studies also under-record the amount — mostly because people can only report having been victims of crime if they know that they have been victimised.",6
1165,"Although such a statement is transparently obvious, as we have demonstrated earlier there are a vast number of crimes where people do not know they are victims, minor thefts, and many white-collar crimes.",6
1166,"Nonetheless, it is likely that victim studies provide a fairly reliable guide for measuring ‘conventional’ crimes assault, robbery and burglary, where the individual will be well aware that he or she was victim.",6
1167,"Even with such ‘conventional, crimes, however, different people might interpret events differently, and there might be a degree of under-reporting this.",6
1168,Some people may define a vague tampering with a door or window at night as an ‘attempted burglary’ while others will not.,6
1169,Victim's interpretations and memories indicate that victim studies cannot be assumed to accurately reflect the ‘real’ extent of crime; and the search for more reliable and direct indicators has included the development of self-report studies.,6
1170,"usually involve asking people to give information about their past illegal activities, a questionnaire or interview.",6
1171,"being asked how often they commit illegal acts, respondents are generally asked details of their social characteristics, social class, race , in an attempt to get round the biases in official criminal statistics.",6
1172,"A range of self-report studies have indicated that a majority of people admit to some kind of illegal activity, whether trivial or serious, which could result in a court appearance.",6
1173,", studies have shown that 90 of boys in the Inner London area admit to having travelled on public transport without a ticket, or to deliberately under-paying; 82 admit breaking windows of empty houses; and only a small percentage claim to have committed no offences.",6
1174,"Again, there are likely to be problems of reliability with such data.",6
1175,"Will people admit to having committed criminal offences, they are guaranteed confidentiality?",6
1176,It seems to go against common-sense notions that individuals would want to hide any misdemeanours or crimes.,6
1177,"Alternatively, respondents may exaggerate their delinquencies bravado, especially likely with juveniles.",6
1178,"Others may under-report dishonesty, forgetfulness or paranoia.",6
1179, that have been made to check the ‘honesty’ of respondents have indicated that about a quarter of respondents are liable to conceal information.,6
1180,A further difficulty is the impossibility of including all criminal acts in a questionnaire or interview.,6
1181,"Thus, the researcher has to be selective, which raises problems which offences should be mentioned and questioned about and which not.",6
1182,"As you will realise, some offences are predominantly working-class and others predominantly middle-class, and it is important that self-report studies do not include too many offences typical of one group or class.",6
1183,A final problem with self-report studies concerns the representativeness of the sample being studied.,6
1184,"Many self-report studies have been carried out in schools, which will tend to result in school drop-outs and truants being excluded from the sample and lead to an unrepresentative sample.",6
1185,"Also, those most likely not to complete the questionnaire or do the interview are most likely to be delinquent; and one cannot force people to fill in questionnaires correctly.",6
1186,"Notwithstanding these difficulties, self-report studies do indicate that middle-class individuals are as likely to commit crimes as working-class individuals.",6
1187,", a research project carried out by the Home Office, is a recent example of how victim and self-report studies can be used to attempt to get round the problems of and  with the official criminal statistics.",6
1188,"The first report was written by and involved in-depth interviews with 11,000 households in England and Wales.",6
1189,"People were asked what crimes they had been victims of (victim study) and about their own law-breaking (self-report study), and they were also asked about their attitudes towards the police and policing.",6
1190,"Thus, this survey combined the two methods we have been looking at above.",6
1191,While such victim and self-report surveys are not new what was new for this country was the scope of this survey.,6
1192,The showed that there were about four times as many crimes committed each year as the police were ever told about.,6
1193,"Although such figures might create public alarm, the main reason given for non-reporting was because the offence was considered too trivial to waste police time (38 of reasons given), or that the police could do nothing about it (16 ).",6
1194,"Fear or dislike of the police was way down the list, at 6 .",6
1195,"The survey also found that those who most feared violence, the elderly and women, were the least likely to experience it, while those most at risk were young males who went out regularly.",6
1196,"particular crimes, the survey perhaps offered some reassurance to those accustomed to the image of a massive upsurge in crime which is so regularly portrayed by the media.",6
1197,"The average household can expect to be burgled once every forty years, , while violent confrontation between the intruder and victim is very rare — one of ail cases.",6
1198,The survey tells us that the chances of being burgled are less than the risk of domestic fire and that the chances of robbery are smaller than those of being admitted to a psychiatric hospital — not that such statistics will be a lot of consolation to those who are burgled or robbed.,6
1199,"The suggests that one in four crimes are officially reported, although sociologists and criminologists suggest that between 10 and 15 is a more probable figure.",6
1200,"However, such a difference can be reconciled, because these type of victim-based surveys can only include crimes where there is a victim who can be interviewed.",6
1201,"Thus, they exclude a range of offences, shoplifting and stealing from work, where the non-reporting is particularly high.",6
1202,"Furthermore, some interviewees will not wish to talk about painful experiences just for the benefit of a survey interviewer.",6
1203,"The figure of one in four crimes being reported refers to crime  , and this ratio of recorded to unrecorded crime varies the particular crime.",6
1204,"The survey shows that there were twice as many burglaries as were recorded by the police, nearly five times as much wounding, twelve times as much theft from the person and, most unexpectedly perhaps, thirteen times as much vandalism or criminal damage to personal and household property.",6
1205,"Thus, the ‘dark figure’ of unrecorded crime depends on the sort of offences that are considered, and if different groups of offence categories are examined, different ratios will be found.",6
1206,"To conclude our review of criminal statistics, it is clear that official statistics on crime, like most statistics, should not be taken at face value as ‘facts’ to be accepted uncritically.",6
1207,They are the product of social processes and they involve the activities not just of offenders but also of decision-makers and enforcers in the area of law and order.,6
1208,Attempts to remedy the deficiencies in these statistics suffer from a number of problems and difficulties themselves.,6
1209,"In fact, any crime rate, whether produced by the police, victim study, self-report study or whatever, will depend on a classification of crime that is socially produced.",6
1210,Documentary readings,6
1211,"The purpose of this chapter is to fill out certain of the areas of the study of crime which have been discussed or referred to in earlier chapters, and to provide readings or extracts from original sociological work in this field.",6
1212,Some of the extracts are extended illustrations of particular areas and issues in the study of crime; others illustrate particular theoretical or methodological issues.,6
1213,Extracts from a number of the studies referred to in the previous chapters are included; as are extracts from works not specifically cited in these chapters but which are closely related to topics and issues raised in them.,6
1214,"As far as possible, the extracts are ordered to follow the structure of the earlier chapters.",6
1215,"Thus, extracts related to Chapter 2 precede those related to Chapter 3 , although certain studies are relevant to one particular aspect of the sociology of crime.",6
1216,Each of the extracts is introduced briefly and related and cross-referenced to earlier section(s) of the book.,6
1217,H. S. Becker: Problems in the study of crime and deviance,6
1218,"In his famous study,, Becker outlines the basic interactionist approach to the study of crime and deviance.",6
1219,It has become one of the basic and seminal texts in the sociological study of this topic.,6
1220,"The first two chapters explain the labelling perspective, with later chapters applying this perspective to specific types of deviant behaviour, drug use.",6
1221,In the final chapter Becker discusses some of the problems involved in the study of crime and deviance.,6
1222,"The following extract is taken from this last chapter, and elaborates on some of the problems we mentioned in our first chapter,(pp 7–8).",6
1223,Reading 1,6
1224,"It is in the nature of the phenomenon of deviance that it will be difficult for anyone to study both sides of the process and accurately capture the perspectives of both classes of participants, rule-breakers and rule-enforcers.",6
1225,"Not that it is impossible, but practical considerations of gaining access to situations and the confidence of the people involved in any reasonable length of time mean that one will probably study the situation from one side or the other.",6
1226,"Whichever class of participants we choose to study and whose viewpoint we therefore choose to take, we will probably be accused of ‘bias’.",6
1227,It will be said that we are not doing justice to the viewpoint of the opposing group.,6
1228,"In presenting the rationalisations and justifications a group offers for doing things as it does, we will seem to be accepting its rationalisations and justifications and accusing other parties to the transaction in the words of their opponents.",6
1229,"If we study drug addicts, they will surely tell us and we will be bound to report that they believe the outsiders who judge them are wrong and inspired by low motives.",6
1230,"If we point to those aspects of the addict's experience which seem to him to confirm his beliefs, we will seem to be making an apology for the addict.",6
1231,"On the other hand, if we view the phenomenon of addiction from the point of view of the enforcement officials, they will tell us and we will be bound to report that they believe addicts are criminal types, have  personalities, have no morals and cannot be trusted.",6
1232,We will be able to point to those aspects of the enforcer's experiences which justify their view.,6
1233,"In so doing, we will seem to be agreeing with his view.",6
1234,"In either case, we shall be accused of presenting a one-sided and distorted view.",6
1235,But this is not really the case.,6
1236,"What we are presenting is not a distorted view of ‘reality’, but the reality which engages the people we have studied, the reality they create by their interpretation of their experience and which they act.",6
1237,"If we fail to present this reality, we will not have achieved full sociological understanding of the phenomenon we seek to explain.",6

1241,Sociological research into crime faces particular problems the nature of the subject being investigated.,6
1242,Suggest some of these problems.,6
1243,A. K. Cohen: The delinquent subculture,6
1244,"In the first chapter of his study,, Cohen provides a very clear definition of the term delinquent subculture, with the main portion of the book then showing how this subculture is vital to the occurrence of delinquency.",6
1245,Below we reproduce Cohen's definition of a delinquent subculture.,6
1246,Reading 2,6
1247,"The expression, ‘the delinquent subculture’, may be new to some readers of this volume.",6
1248,"The idea for which it stands, however, is a commonplace of folk — scientific — thinking.",6
1249,"When Mrs Jones says: ‘My Johnny is really a good boy but got to running around with the wrong bunch and got into trouble’, she is making a set of assumptions which, when spelled out more explicitly, constitute the foundations of an important school of thought in the scientific study of juvenile delinquency.",6
1250,"She is affirming that delinquency is  an inborn disposition nor something the child has contrived by himself; that children learn to become delinquents by becoming members of groups in which delinquent conduct is already established and the ‘thing to do’; and that a child need not be ‘different’ from other children, that he need not have any twists or defects of personality or intelligence, to become a delinquent.",6
1251,"In the language of contemporary sociology, she is saying that juvenile delinquency is a subculture…",6
1252,"When we speak of a delinquent subculture, we speak of a way of life that has somehow become traditional among certain groups in American society.",6
1253,These groups are the boys' gangs that flourish most conspicuously in the ‘delinquent neighbourhoods’ of our large American cities.,6
1254,"The members of these gangs grow up, some to become law-abiding citizens and others to graduate to more professional  and adult forms of criminality, but the delinquent tradition is kept alive be the age-groups that succeed them…",6
1255,"Delinquency, this view, is not an expression or contrivance of a particular kind of personality; it may be imposed upon any kind of personality if circumstances favour intimate association with delinquent models.",6
1256,"The process of becoming a delinquent is the same as the process of becoming, let us say, a Boy Scout.",6
1257,The difference lies only in the cultural pattern with which the children associates.,6
1258,"Cohen, A. K.,, 1955, pp. 11–14",6
1259,Discussion questions,6
1260,1,6
1261,In what ways does the social environment predispose certain individuals to join delinquent subcultures?,6
1262,2,6
1263,Discuss some of the difficulties with the concept of the delinquent subculture (refer to the section on subcultural theories in Chapter 2).,6
1264,G. Pearson: The history of crime and delinquency,6
1265,"In Chapter 3, we examined in some detail Pearson's review of the history of street crime in Britain, and his criticism of the widely held belief that such crime is a unique feature of present-day society.",6
1266,The following extract from this fascinating historical study deals with the problems of locating a ‘golden age’ when Britain was relatively free of crime and lawlessness.,6
1267,Reading 3,6
1268,"Now, what I wish to ask in this book is whether this way of thinking about Britain's decline is useful and accurate.",6
1269,And if it is not (and I will argue that it is not) then to what extent does this tradition of anguished regret for the past hinder our actions in the present and the future?…,6
1270,This view of Britain's history as one founded on stability and decency is deeply ingrained in the self-understanding of the British people.,6
1271,"The present, we hardly need to be told, is extremely tense.",6
1272,"But the past, say the accumulated traditions  of our national culture, was a ‘golden age’ of order and security.",6
1273,Nowadays we need the iron fist of policing that we might sleep soundly in our beds.,6
1274,"Whereas formerly we did not, and our love of tolerant freedom was spontaneous, unregimented and natural.",6
1275,"The extremity of these awful judgements against the moral deterioration of the British people, and the enormous vision of chaos and disorder which they conjure up, suggest the need for a cautious organisation of our thought and feeling as we approach these matters.",6
1276,"Clearly, there is an impressive consistency in this line of thinking — both the belief in a pre-existing era of  , and in the agreement that the natural moderacy of the ‘British way of life’ has been eclipsed in the hooligan deluge.",6
1277,"However, when we come to more details considerations — exactly where this ‘golden age’ is to be located in real historical time — then we are confronted with such a disorderly jumble of datemarks and vague historical allusions allow for wide margins of disagreement even among dedicated ‘law-and-order’enthusiasts.",6
1278,"Indeed, at the centre of the preoccupation with declining standards and mounting disorder, there is an immense historical ‘black hole’.",6
1279,"Pearson, G.,, 1983, pp. 7–8",6
1280,P. Corrigan: Contemporary delinquency — the problem of leisure,6
1281,"In our discussion of delinquency in contemporary society (Chapter 3, pp. 34–35) we looked at Paul Corrigan's study of working-class boys in the north-east of England.",6
1282,Corrigan points out that the delinquency of these boys cannot be explained or understood outside the context of their leisure activities (or lack of them).,6
1283,", the boys drift into and minor delinquencies while hanging around the streets in groups looking for something to do, as the following extract from his study illustrates.",6
1284,Reading 4,6
1285,"It was between the area of talking, joking and carrying on that things emerged that the boys called ‘ideas’.",6
1286,"These ‘ideas, formed the basis for group action and it is the way in which these spontaneously evolve and are carried out that constitutes one of the most active elements of ‘hanging about’…",6
1287,"Albert (one of the boys studied): Well, somebody gets a weird idea into their head, and they start to carry it out, and others join in.",6
1288,Question: Weird idea?,6
1289,Albert: Things…like going around smashing milk bottles.,6
1290,"Boys on a Saturday night in Sunderland, in a group, on a street comer, are aware that they are ‘doing nothing’ and are bored with it in their own minds, essentially wanting something to happen.",6
1291,"They want to have an interesting or exciting time, a time that would not be boring, where they could create some action…",6
1292,"If we analyse the street-comer activity of doing nothing in groups always hoping that something will happen, then the creation and the putting into effect of ‘ideas’ by the group can be seen as one of the most significant group experiences.",6
1293,"Their significance is not only the group experience but also the wider society, for it is these ideas born the street-corner groups, doing nothing, that are to a large extent the ‘juvenile delinquency’ of the police and criminologists.",6
1294,"Most significantly, these ideas are born boredom and the expectation of future and continuing boredom, and this affects the sort of ideas that they are.",6
1295,A good ‘idea’ must contain the seeds of continuing change (from the boring situation) excitement and involvement.,6
1296,Smashing milk bottles is a good example of this since it typifies the way in which they are put into effect.,6
1297,"Methodologically, it is not possible for any researcher to get the kids to talk with much sense of ideas since the question ‘Why?’ to the smashing of milk bottles is one that is not possible for the boy to answer outside the context of the whole Saturday evening…",6
1298,For the sort of interaction that we are referring to here is not the smashing of things.,6
1299,It is not that boys go out on a Saturday night looking for milk bottles or other things to smash.,6
1300,Rather they use smashing as something interesting to do…,6
1301,Question: What sort of things do you do on a Saturday evening?,6
1302,"Peter: Usually play football down the street, play footy.",6
1303,Just gang down the court or somewhere then come home.,6
1304,Question: What other things do you do?,6
1305,Peter: On Saturday I knock around with me mates.,6
1306,Question: What do you do?,6
1307,"Peter: Well, cause trouble, you know; play knocking on doors, throw stones at windows and that.",6
1308,Cause fights mostly.,6
1309,"Is it necessary to explain the excitement of smashing things, whether they are milk bottles, shop windows, buses, telephone boxes or whatever, if the alternative is to stand there and do nothing.",6
1310,"Corrigan, P.,, 1979, pp. 128–130",6

1312,1,6
1313,Which sociological method do you feel would be most appropriate to the sort of research carried out by Corrigan?,6

1315,Suggest possible difficulties with the use of other sociological methods for studying the leisure activities of these boys.,6
1316,3,6
1317,Explain how boredom is crucial to the sort of minor delinquencies Corrigan is examining.,6
1318,M. Levi: The corporate criminal in prison,6
1319,In Chapter 3 we looked at Levi's study of long-firm fraud as an example of corporate crime.,6
1320,"Below we include a brief extract from this study which looks at the problems and consequences of conviction for the business, ‘respectable’ criminal in comparison to the regular criminal — bearing in mind, , that the business criminal is far less likely to be convicted that most other types of criminal.",6
1321,Reading 5,6
1322,"Most long-firm fraudsters manage quite successfully in prison, although its entertainments and amenities are hardly to their taste…",6
1323,"They are rarely troublesome prisoners, although they often continue their ‘operator’ habits while inside…",6
1324,"Long-firmers are experienced manipulators, and they make entertaining company for both prisoners and staff.",6
1325,"Consequently, unless there are ‘gangsters’ around, they usually manage to get the best jobs in prison…",6
1326,"It might be argued that despite their relative success at ‘making out’ in prison, long-firm fraudsters suffer far greater ‘relative deprivation’than do other prisoners.",6
1327,"For on the outside, they live far more lavishly than do ‘ordinary’ criminals, and experience a correspondingly greater contrast between ‘normal’and prison life…",6
1328,"Although there is some truth in this relative deprivation argument, it is equally important to note that the pains of imprisonment are mitigated by pleasant recollections: to be doing ‘a lot of bird’ without having lived well seems far more futile and absurd that to be paying for the rich fruits that crime has already brought.",6
1329,there are benefits to be weighed against the costs!,6
1330,"Levi, M.,, 1981, pp. 115–116",6
1331,Discussion question,6
1332,1,6
1333,"Why might sentencers — judges and magistrates — treat middle-class, business criminals more leniently than those convicted of more ‘conventional’ crimes?",6
1334,G. Mars: Cheats at work: employee theft,6
1335,"In Chapter 3 we discussed briefly employee theft, and, , Ditton's study of fiddling at a factory-production bakery.",6
1336,"In a similar vein, Mars has studied the everyday crimes of normal people in the normal circumstances of their work — what Ditton calls ‘part-time crime’.",6
1337,"Mars is not concerned with the spectacular or the ‘one-off’ crime, but with activities that are an accepted part of everyday jobs.",6
1338,"The extent and variety of these activities are astonishing, but while almost everyone is aware of them, and although the majority of us fiddle in one way or another, fiddling is generally considered a trivial activity without serious implications.",6
1339,"Mars' book challenges this view, and we will include two extracts from it.",6
1340,The following extract is part of an examination of how management have periodic ‘purges’ on their workforce in an attempt to control and crack down on fiddling.,6
1341,Reading 6,6
1342,"When workers think a periodic purge is imminent, everyone feels equally threatened.",6
1343,"knows where lightening may strike, the precise purpose of an investigation, or who specifically will be investigated.",6
1344,So everyone takes avoiding action.,6
1345,A waitress told me of such an incident when she heard a rumour that her hotel management had appointed private detectives with the power to search staff homes — a not uncommon fear among hotel workers and one paralleling similar periodic fears in other occupations of this type.,6
1346,"I was at the Embassy then, and it used to be very busy.",6
1347,Everyone was fiddling like mad when we got a leak through from the office that they were sending private detectives round the houses…,6
1348,I was petrified because all my sheets and tableclothes and all my cutlery and silver were all stamped with the Embassy crest.,6
1349,"Well, I didn't know that to do.",6
1350,"As I say, I was petrified!",6
1351,"So I made an excuse, I said I was ill, and rushed off home.",6
1352,I piled everything i could on a sheet in the middle of the floor and tied up the corners…,6
1353,I dashed into the garden — nut there — and started digging a bloody great hole.,6
1354,"I wasn't laughing at the time, though, I can tell you, because the more I dug down, the more I was digging up!",6
1355,"There was a pile of coffee pots, cutlery and rotten linen already in the garden that had been buried there by the waiter who'd had the house before me!",6
1356,He must have done exactly the same thing as I did when the panic hit him.,6
1357,"Mars, G.,, 1982, pp. 130–131",6
1358,"Later in the book, Mars attempts to put fiddles into context, to point out the conditions that favour them and the places where they are most likely to flourish.",6
1359,The opportunities and indeed the pressures for people to fiddle vary widely and Mars suggests a number of ‘fiddle-prone’ factors attached to particular occupations.,6
1360,"One of these factors he terms ‘exploiting expertise’, and is the subject of our second extract.",6
1361,Reading 7,6
1362,A widespread factor is found where real or suggested expertise  is involved in a transaction and where at the same time it may be assumed that the customer is ignorant about what it is he is paying for.,6
1363,This factor therefore depends upon an imbalance in power which is based on an imbalance in knowledge.,6
1364,"These conditions exist in garage servicing, though they are con fined to it.",6
1365,"They are indeed well represented among repairmen of all kinds and are also found, to a degree, among the professions.",6
1366,"It is useful, however, if we begin this discussion with garage servicing…",6
1367,"The economic base to garage servicing (following O'Brien,, 10th September 1977) lacks two conditions that normally operate in pricing: the first is that consumers should have speedy knowledge of defects in what they buy; the second that they are free to move from an unsatisfactory supplier to a more satisfactory one.",6
1368,In competitive trading these conditions exist and the price system benefits the consumer…,6
1369,These two conditions are absent from garage servicing.,6
1370,O'Brien uses the phrase ‘perverse incentives’ to explain how a garage that performs poorly is likely to do better than one that performs well.,6
1371,"He argues that bad garages drive out good ones because the typical customer cannot judge whether a service has been done properly, and it is difficult for him to check.",6
1372,"Thus a garage can, with impunity, charge for a full service which has only been half done…",6
1373,"For if a garage habitually does half the service its costs are very much lower than if it has done the full service; and since it can charge the full price, the ignorance of the consumer, its pro fits are maximised when it does as little of the service as it can get away with.",6
1374,"There is probably some lower limit below which the garage will not go in skimping the service, because the risk of detection then becomes too high (O'Brien).",6
1375,The garage benefits even further since faults from defective service are unlikely to occur immediately after collection of a vehicle.,6
1376,"An ignorant motorist is likely, therefore, to absolve the garage from responsibility and pay it further to rectify these new faults.",6
1377,"Mars, G.,1982, pp. 142–144",6
1378,Discussion questions,6
1379,1,6
1380,Suggest other situations where there is scope for ‘fiddling’ based on the superior knowledge of the provider of a service over the customer.,6
1381,2,6
1382,"Another ‘fiddle-prone’ factor attached to certain occupations suggested by Mars is ‘passing trade’, where two sides of a transaction meet only once.",6
1383,How might ‘passing trade’ aid or encourage workplace crime?,6
1384,A. Campbell: Shoplifting — the ‘typical’ female crime,6
1385,"This reading shows Anne Campbell's attempt to explain the relatively high involvement of females in shoplifting, sometimes seen as the ‘typical’ female crime.",6
1386,"popular belief, shoplifting is neither a new word nor a new occurrence.",6
1387,"However, while shoplifting occurred in the past, the extent of the crime has grown massively in recent years.",6
1388,"From 1939 to 1964, offences quadrupled to over 60,000 known offences.",6
1389,"By 1972, that figure had doubled to over 120,000 offences and since then there has been a steady increase.",6
1390,"Although popularly thought of as a female offence, women do not outnumber men among those found guilty.",6
1391,"Over the last twenty years, women have made up just under 50 of all convicted shoplifters.",6
1392,"This still makes it the one serious, widespread offence in which the rate of female offenders is nearly equivalent to the rate of male offenders, as the table on page 49 illustrates.",6
1393,Campbell suggests that there are extra pressures on girls which push them towards certain types of crime.,6
1394,"Girls are brought up with calls to buy cosmetics, jewellery and clothes and to do what they can to enhance their looks.",6
1395,"Thus, females tend to be more susceptible to the pressures of the market and the forces of consumerism than males.",6
1396,This will tend to incline them toward petty theft.,6
1397,"Campbell focuses on girl shoplifters, but it should be stressed that other females who shoplift, perhaps pensioners or single parents, might do so for more basic material needs.",6
1398,Reading 8,6
1399,Studies of shoplifting have in the main concentrated either on  the pathological individual personality of the offender or the shop policy that promotes this kind of behaviour.,6
1400,"Very few studies have sought to position shoplifting within a broader social and political sphere, where women are vulnerable to a consumer fetishism that drives them to lawbreaking…",6
1401,"Girls, , are a particularly fruitful market.",6
1402,"Even with subcultures, it is characteristically the females who are the most susceptible to fashion and cosmetic selling.",6
1403,"As a group, women have historically been preoccupied with appearance-…(which) is capitalised upon by the fashion and beauty manufacturers, whose methods can be seen in any women's magazine…",6
1404,"The common theme is the necessity of spending money to look good, and since fashions-change, that requires a never-ending outlay of cash…",6
1405,Why is (shoplifting) a crime in which girls participate in greater numbers than in any other offence?,6
1406,The answer given by many writers is solely the greater exposure among women to goods and shops: the simple opportunity thesis.,6
1407,"But this, it is important to consider the extent to which self-representation and appearance are particularly important to girls economically and therefore psychologically…",6
1408,The message is clear: men want beauty not brains.,6
1409,The function of women is decorative.,6
1410,"Every minute spent in physical self-improvement is an investment, not only materially but emotional adjustment too.",6

1413,"Four girls in every 10 chose office work, and, by including the jobs of teachers, nurses, shop assistants, bank clerks, receptionists, telephonists, hairdressers and nannies, three-quarters of the choices were accounted for…",6
1414,"With the exception of teaching and nursing, these jobs require little specialised training, and for most a good physical appearance is a distinct advantage.",6
1415,"The importance of looks becomes even more pronounced when considering the types of occupations to which girls, often unrealistically, aspire — the glamour jobs.",6
1416,"The role of air hostesses, models, actresses, public relations officers, sales  representatives, promotion girls and personal assistants is often one of sexual window-dressing and male ego-boosting.",6

1425,M. Cain: Different styles of policing and their effects on criminal statistics,6
1426,Cain's study on rural and urban police forces illustrates very distinctly the differing styles of policing in different areas.,6

1432,"People would address the beat policeman by name or else as ‘sir’, while he in turn would have a ‘Good morning’ for everyone encountered…",6
1433,At the time of the study the city operated a system of foot patrols plus an emergency car service (distinct from traffic patrol).,6
1434,"Two or three vehicles patrolled the division throughout the day, and it was claimed, with slight exaggeration, that any point could be reached within four minutes…",6
1435,The result was that the man left walking the beat had little of interest to do responding to requests for emergency services…,6
1436,"After postings to the cars and station offices this left 2⅔ men ‘on the ground’ per sub-division, or one man for every 26,838 of the population.",6
1437,"Contrast this with the mean  population of a rural one-man beat, a constant and stable 1,307 identifiable individuals…",6
1438,There were three main responses by the men to this situation.,6
1439,"The first, which was the officially approved response, was ‘to make the work interesting’ by developing contacts with shopkeepers and others on the beat, and keeping an eye open for unusual activity…",6
1440,"The second response to the endemic boredom, monotony and frequent cold, and to the impossibility of achieving the formally stated goals, was ‘easing behaviour’…",6
1441,The third means of making a dull and cold eight hours more tolerable was to seek marginally legitimate arrests.,6
1442,"This gave excitement, the opportunity to go off duty early or to return to the warmth and relative conviviality of the police station, prestige…",6
1443,"During 1963, at the central police station on the research division, 76 of the 611 arrests made by uniformed men were for offences against the public order vagrancy, loitering, and above all drunkenness…",6
1444,Impressions gained in this study suggest that ‘crime work’ ranks high in the police value system…,6
1445,Certainly men at the central station boasted proudly of the fact that they took more prisoners per year than any other division in the whole force.,6

1453,How might criminal statistics (including both the extent of crime recorded and the character or type of crime) be influenced by the operation of the police the amount of actual criminal behaviour?,6

1455,"The main focus of our examination of criminal statistics, Chapter 4, was on the problems and  with these statistics.",6
1456,Pearson's study of the history of street crime in Britain clearly illustrates the problem of using criminal statistics as a means for comparing the rate of crime over extended periods of time.,6
1457,"The following reading, from the final part of Pearson's book, gives specific examples of how changes in the way in which the law is enforced makes historical comparisons of the rate of criminality virtually impossible.",6
1458,Reading 10,6
1459,"Criminal statistics are notoriously unreliable as measures of the actual extent of criminal activity, to such a degree that it is not unknown for historians to discount them altogether.",6
1460,The reason for their notoriety is that they are complicated by a number of factors others than real changes in the levels of crime.,6
1461,The growing size of the police force and its supporting apparatus is the most obvious and general factor.,6
1462,"Changes in the routines of law enforcement, the increased mobility of the police, changes in what the law counts as crime, fluctuations in the vigour with which the law is applied, and shifts in public attitudes and tolerance — these must all be counted within the hidden dimensions of the manufacture of crime figures…",6
1463,Between 1900 and the late 1970s…we are asked to strike comparisons between such different styles of law enforcement as to make little sense.,6
1464,"First, in the earlier period there were wide margins of discretion within an extremely informal mode of policing — the proverbial clip around the ear, or the dreaded flick of the Edwardian policemen's rolled cape — which has been replaced by the more likely possibility of prosecution, or the issue of formal caution.",6
1465,"And a formal caution, unlike a clip around the ear, goes into the record book as a ‘known crime’.",6
1466,We have also seen how in earlier times people involved in acts of gross disorder would commonly be charged only with simple assault or drunkenness…street violence was too much of an everyday occurrence to count as ‘real’ crime.,6
1467,There was also a tendency not to record incidents which could not be cleared up.,6
1468,"Until the 1930s, , it was a routine practice of the London police to record thefts reported to them by the public as ‘lost property’.",6
1469,"When this practice was changed, recorded levels of property crime soared: but, obviously, as a consequence of changes in policing and not as  a result of changes in crime.",6
1470,"In overall terms, between 1900 and the present day, the state apparatus for collecting and sorting criminal information has changed so dramatically that we must question whether it can supply us with a valid measuring-stick with which to compare the two periods.",6
1471,The cluttered informality of the Edwardian local police station with its rudimentary procedures for record-keeping has been replaced by elaborate computer-assisted systems of information retrieval.,6
1472,"And they enhance the efficiency of the police, they certainly expand the crime statistics…",6
1473,To ask us to strike meaningful comparisons across such a technological gulf is like trying to compare a theory of the origins of the universe based on observations through Galileo's lens with one facilitated by radio telescope.,6

1493,"Public opinion toward them varies from suspicion to hostility, and a major police problem would appear to be relations with the public.",6
1494,"The PSI report indicates that roughly half of the London population have serious doubts about the standard of police conduct, although in most cases police misconduct was not seen as a normal, everyday occurrence.",6
1495,"The PSI report is the most detailed study of a British police force yet produced, and Section Four of the report, entitled ‘The police and people in London’, examines the relationship between the police and the public in some depth.",6

2,The areal interpolation problem: estimating population using remote sensing in a GIS framework,7
3,"Mitchel Langford, David J. Maguire and David J. Unwin",7
4,Introduction,7
5,Data integration is one of the fundamental GIS operations (Burrough 1986).,7
6,"It involves transformation of data they are reported at a comparable geographical scale, projection and set of geographical units.",7
7,The need for data integration arises because many of the questions which scientists and social scientists investigate require data from a wide range of sources which are only reported on disparate spatial bases.,7
8,Data integration is especially a problem for geographers because information synthesis is at the very heart of the discipline.,7
9,The difficulties of integrating data are compounded by the fact that there are few standards governing the way in which geographical data are collected and reported.,7
10,"Hearnshaw (1989), , highlight the problem in the context of Leicestershire, a county in the Midlands of England, and show the difficulties of linking enumeration district (ED), ward, parish and postcode data.",7
11,"Similarly, Openshaw (1986) report that the data in the Domesday System are available for 25 different and incompatible types of areal unit.",7
12,Strategies for integrating data reported at different geographical scales and for different map projections have received considerable attention over the past few decades (Robinson 1984; Burrough 1986).,7
13,"Although there are still a number of problems to be solved, in contrast to the difficulties of comparing data reported for different spatial units, these aspects of data integration are fairly well developed and understood.",7
14,"In this chapter we concentrate on the problem of integrating geographical data reported for different areal spatial units, one of the most intractable of all data integration problems.",7
15,A fuller description of the process of data integration is presented by Flowerdew and Green in Chapter 4.,7
16,Areal interpolation,7
17,"There have been a number of published attempts to provide solutions to the cross-area aggregation, or ‘areal interpolation’ problem (Goodchild and Lam 1980; Lam 1983).",7
18,These have been summarized and classified by Flowerdew and Openshaw (1987) and several examples are given in Hearnshaw (1989).,7
19,"The areal interpolation problem can be defined as the transfer of data from one set (source units or zones) to a second set (target units) of overlapping, non-hierarchical areal units.",7
20,"Where the source zones nest hierarchically into the target zones, UK administrative EDs nest exactly in wards, transfer of data from the source units to the target units is one of simple aggregation.",7
21,"However, where the units are overlapping and non-hierarchical the problem is more complex and it is this that we investigate here.",7
22,The nature of the problem can be illustrated with an example.,7
23,"A common problem in geographical information systems (GIS), and one which has been known about for many years in the context of choropleth mapping, is that of producing maps from population data aggregated over selected arbitrary areal units.",7
24,"In the UK, the decennial Census of Population records the number of individual people and households, but almost all population data are reported as various aggregations which ensure that data about individuals cannot be recovered.",7
25,"Unfortunately, the aggregations are generally chosen for non-statistical reasons and so differ from data set to data set and are often unstable over time.",7
26,This makes any comparative analysis of data recorded at different times or using different aggregation units problematical.,7
27,"The difficulty is particularly important in studies where it is necessary to find the denominator, to estimate the incidence of a property as a proportion of some population total.",7
28,", the numerator might be a count of people in a postcode sector who have, say, a cancer, yet, because the census and health data are reported for different areal units, it is not possible to find the appropriate at-risk population for the denominator and so compute a reliable incidence ratio.",7
29,"Although this example relates to what have been termed ‘imposed’ areal units, that have no landscape reality (Unwin 1981), it is increasingly necessary to create aggregations of population over ‘natural’areal units a soil association or outcrop of a particular rock type.",7
30,The solutions to this type of problem utilize either point interpolation or areal interpolation methods (Lam 1983) and these will be examined in turn.,7
31,"The point interpolation methods essentially use a point, usually the centroid, as a surrogate for the areal units and then apply conventional point interpolation methods.",7
32,The crudest of these involves matching the centroids of source and target units by minimum distance nearest neighbour techniques.,7
33,A slightly less crude method is to use the centroids to generate a continuous surface by interpolation.,7
34,The target zones are then overlain and the interpolated value is transferred into the zones.,7
35,"However, this technique is particularly unsuitable for population estimation  because as Tobler (1979) points out, there is a danger that people can be created or removed.",7
36,"Martin (1988, 1989) describes a simple algorithm that uses the ED centroids, with a spreading function to allocate people to neighbouring grid squares, which incorporates Tobler's idea.",7
37,An intermediate method between the point and areal methods uses point-in-polygon techniques (Burrough 1986) to locate the centroids of the source units in the boundaries of the target units.,7
38,"Although relatively unsophisticated, this method is reasonably fast and it seems to work satisfactorily where the target units are much larger than the source units",7
39,"Also in situations where the target units are much larger than the source units, polygon-in-polygon areal interpolation techniques can be used to obtain reasonable estimates by locating the source units within the target units.",7
40,A simple decision rule can be used to decide what to do in the case of source units which cross the target unit boundaries.,7
41,The most reliable and accurate estimates can normally be obtained using one of the true cross-areal interpolation methods.,7
42,Lam (1983) suggests that there are two types of true areal interpolation methods: polygon overlay and pycnophylactic interpolation (Tobler 1979).,7
43,These are well known and have been described elsewhere (Lam 1983; Wagner 1989).,7
44,"The above areal interpolation methods are alike in that, the purely spatial information given by the boundaries, areas or centroids of the areal units involved, no extra information is used in interpolation.",7
45,In a truly integrated GIS framework (Jackson and Mason 1986) it is almost certain to be the case that other potentially useful information is available.,7
46,This additional information can be used for ‘intelligent’ interpolation.,7
47,Flowerdew (1988) developed a theoretically sound and very general statistical approach using Poisson regression which incorporated an additional binary variable.,7
48,He predicted the population characteristics of parliamentary  in Lancashire (the target units) from district level data (the source units) using the party affiliation of the constituency's Member of Parliament as a binary variable.,7
49,"In this chapter, we develop a method similar to Flowerdew's in which we use GIS techniques to enable areal interpolation to be informed by the distribution of land-cover types, as inferred from a classified Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image, in both the source (1981 Census wards) and target (National Grid kilometre squares) units.",7
50,The basic approach,7
51,The basic idea is simple.,7
52,A suitable satellite image is classified using image-processing techniques to identify the various types of land cover which exist over the entire study area at very fine spatial resolution.,7
53,"Thus, for each census ward for which a 1981 population total exists, it is possible to determine the number of pixels classified as a certain land-cover type.",7
54,It  is then feasible to express the known ward populations as a function of these pixel counts.,7
55,"Provided the model relating population to these land-cover data is reasonably good, the resulting relationship can then be used to estimate populations for any set of imposed or natural areal units that can also be located on the image.",7
56,The use of remotely sensed data to inform population mapping is not new.,7
57,"Previous attempts to estimate entire populations, especially of Third World cities, include studies by Ogrosky (1975), Lo and Welch (1977) and Han (1985).",7
58,"Similarly, a number of authors have used vertical aerial photography to estimate residential densities across individual cities (see, , Collins and El-Beik 1971; Hsu 1971; Clayton and Estes 1980) while others have experimented with the use of satellite imagery (Iisaka and Hegedus 1982).",7
59,Convenient summaries of this previous work are to be found in Lo (1986) and Griffiths (1988).,7
60,The work described here involves four distinct steps.,7
61,"First, there is the choice of satellite image and the production of a land-cover map.",7
62,"Second, there is the overlay this map of the 1981 Census ward boundaries and summation of pixels falling into each of the recognized land-cover types.",7
63,"Third, there is the statistical modelling of the relationship between population and land cover and the validation of the resulting model.",7
64,"Finally, at the end of the process lies the estimation of the population over some target set of areal units, in our case the kilometre squares of the UK National Grid.",7
65,Obtaining a land-cover classification,7
66,A Landsat TM image of Leicestershire recorded on a cloud-free day in July 1984 constitutes the basic data source.,7
67,"This area was selected for study the authors' familiarity with it, the adequate rural-urban contrast and the availability of a suitable image.",7
68,"The ground resolution of a TM image is such that a pixel has about a 30 m side, which seems appropriate for the scale of analysis used.",7
69,"Indeed, it may be that an image of higher spatial resolution, one obtained by a SPOT satellite (20/10 m), would prove counterproductive, giving too much local variation in pixel reflectance.",7
70,The full seven bands of image data were loaded into an ERDAS (Earth Resources Data Analysis System) software system and ground control point information entered to rectify the image to National Grid coordinates.,7
71,"This rectified image was then subsetted to give an area covering the 49 wards that make up the districts of Oadby and Wigston, Leicester, and Charnwood in northern Leicestershire (Fig. 5.1).",7
72,"Since a faithful classification of land cover is an essential component in the proposed scheme, several attempts were made in an effort to obtain a consistent and suitably detailed product.",7
73,"An unsupervised classification provided an acceptable separation between rural and urban cover, but finer detail was concentrated in agricultural subdivisions at the expense of intra-urban differentiation.",7
74,"Information on agricultural land use is unimportant to this application, whereas urban detail illustrating housing densities or alternative urban land is highly desirable.",7
75,A second classification was made using a supervised approach we could capitalize on our local knowledge of the study area.,7
76,The supervised approach enabled urban subdivision of dense and less dense housing.,7
77,"The result was an improvement over the unsupervised product, and yet we still felt that further urban differentiation might be possible.",7
78,"This led us to undertake a principal components transformation of the seven bands of image data, which gave encouraging results similar to those obtained by Forster (1985a).",7
79,"As a data compression exercise, the first four components of the transformation reduced the storage requirement by 42 for less than 1 loss in information content.",7
80,"However, of great significance was the information displayed in the transformed images.",7
81,"The first principal component, carrying 50 of the original variance, was dominated by land-cover differences in the rural area.",7
82,The second component (40 of variance) revealed the urban distribution very clearly with a strong rural/urban differentiation.,7
83,"The third component, despite carrying only 6 of the original variance, revealed intra-urban differentiation with a clarity unseen in any RGB (red-green-blue (colour)), composite taken from the original bands.",7
84,"The fourth component (2 of variance) was dominated by the thermal infra-red band, recording thermal characteristics of the surface at poor spatial resolution.",7
85,"Finally, the remaining three components seemed to consist of uninterpretable noise.",7
86,"As previously stated, rural land cover was not an important consideration, and so the first component image was discarded, together with the last three, leaving components 2, 3 and 4.",7
87,"When these components were displayed as an RGB composite they continued to show good urban differentiation, closely matching both our local knowledge of the area and the ground truth data that were collected.",7
88,"The final attempt at classification involved a supervised classification of principal components, 2, 3 and 4.",7
89,This produced the land-cover classification shown for a part of the area in Fig. 5.2.,7
90,"Other, similar attempts to produce urban cover classification using satellite data are discussed in Jackson (1980), Forster (1983, 1985b), Wheeler (1985), Lam (1987) and Griffiths (1988).",7
91,"In an interesting variation of the work described here, Quarmby (1988a) outline the use of census data to derive training sets for classifying urban areas into housing types.",7
92,Quarmby (1988b) also discuss the use of SPOT data for monitoring urban land-use change in south-east England.,7
93,"For analytical purposes, the 12 categories of land cover recognized during the classification stage were compressed into five representing:",7
94,1.,7
95,Industry and commerce (presumably detected by large single buildings and different building materials);,7
96,2.,7
97,Dense residential areas;,7
98,3.,7
99,Ordinary residential areas;,7
100,4.,7
101,"Areas that logically have no population (quarries, woods, water bodies);",7
102,5.,7
103,All agricultural land uses.,7
104,Overlaying census ward boundaries,7
105,"In the second phase of the work, digitized 1981 Census ward boundaries and population totals were compiled using GIMMS and SASPAC (at Manchester Computer Centre).",7
106,These data were transferred into ERDAS and rasterized.,7
107,ERDAS GIS functions were used to overlay the ward boundaries the classified image and then count the number of pixels of each recognized land-cover type within each ward.,7
108,The result was a data matrix giving pixel counts for five land-cover types together with the recorded population for the 49 wards.,7
109,These data are summarized in Table 5.1 and Fig. 5.3 is a map of the population density.,7
110,Towards a statistical model,7
111,Table 5.2 shows the matrix of intercorrelations between these six variables.,7
112,"The ward population, the response variable, has a relatively high positive correlation with the ‘industry and commerce’, ‘dense residential’ and ‘ordinary    residential’variables and low negative correlations with ‘nobody’and ‘agriculture’.",7
113,There are equally logical intercorrelations between the various land-cover pixel counts which are used as the carrier variables.,7
114,Our intention is to express the ward populations as some function of the pixel counts for each land-cover type.,7
115,"It should be apparent that there is a very large number of possible models that might be used and, indeed, a number of considerations involved in making this choice (see Dunn 1989).",7
116,", three such considerations influenced our analysis and selection of carrier variables.",7
117,"First, there is a conflict between a desire to maximize the fit obtained, by inclusion of as many statistically significant terms as possible, and simple logic which suggests that the correct form of any fitted model should be a linear weighted sum of only those land-cover types that actually contain mostly housing (’ dense’and ‘resid’) without any intercept term.",7
118,In such a model the weights themselves will have a direct interpretation as the average population density per Landsat pixel.,7
119,"Second, although there is no reason to expect any model to be linear and additive, there is an argument, presented by Flowerdew (1988), which says that since the response variable compromises count data, the appropriate regression model should combine a Poisson error distribution with an identity link function (see Aitkin 1989; 217).",7
120,"Third, there are a number of criteria for goodness of fit.",7
121,"Although the usual coefficient of determination or scaled deviance can be used to indicate the global fit of any specified model, it is also important to examine model performance when estimating populations over areal units the wards from which the models were derived.",7
122,"In this study, this was achieved by examining the estimated kilometre square populations together with those which were reported for the same areal units in the 1971 Census of Population.",7
123,Three methods were examined in detail using the MINITAB and GLIM packages.,7
124,A ‘Shotgun’ model,7
125,"The overall regression equation, calibrated by ordinary least squares, relating population to the carrier variables is  Table 5.3 gives further details.",7
126,"It will be seen that although the overall fit, at 84 is good, only industry, dense residential and ordinary residential have significant regression constants.",7
127,The same set of variables used in a model with a Poisson error term gives the model  which is remarkably similar.,7
128,Figure 5.4 shows the standardized residuals for this model.,7
129,Four wards are particularly badly fitted.,7
130,"In the western central area, two rural wards (Charnwood 16 and 17) actually have almost doubled the fitted value.",7
131,"In the west of Leicester's urban area, Newton ward, with population 20 440, has a fitted value of only 13 495 and is badly fitted by all the models examined.",7
132,This is probably the large preponderance of low-rise multi-storey council housing.,7
133,"Finally, there is an over-prediction of the population of    central Leicester itself (The Castle ward), which is another feature shown by all the models.",7
134,"Although this Shotgun model gives the best fit to the observed ward population data, it is logically flawed in two respects.",7
135,"First, it is evident that the correct form of any model linking population to land cover should not have an intercept constant; if there is no residential cover, then there should be no population.",7
136,"Second, three of the variables incorporated  into it have negative signs, indicating that as the number of pixels of these types increases, so population decreases.",7
137,"At first sight, this seems reasonable, but when the model is used to estimate populations of any other arbitrary areas there is a possibility that, if there is very little housing, it will predict negative populations.",7
138,A further point is that the Shotgun model includes a large number of carrier variables and that it is worth further investigation to see if a more parsimonious model provides a satisfactory relationship.,7
139,A ‘Focused’ model,7
140,"It is thus argued that any statistical model linking pixel counts of land cover to population should be simple, linear, additive and without any intercept constant.",7
141,"In such a model, the individual coefficients have a direct interpretation as the average density of people in each 30 m square pixel of the specified type.",7
142,The ordinary least squares focused model is pop 81 = 9.89 dense + 5.03 resid whereas specification of Poisson errors gives pop 81 = 10.93 dense + 4.82 resid Note that the estimated population densities for a 30 m square pixel for the two types of residential housing identified using the Landsat data seem reasonable and that this model cannot produce negative population estimates.,7
143,"In the intercept constant form, this greatly simplified model has an R2 of 81.8 .",7
144,"The reduction to just the two land-cover categories, concerned with housing, loses only 3 explanation when compared with the Shotgun model.",7
145,"for these re; sons, the Focused model is considered to be superior to the Shotgun model.",7
146,Figure 5.5 shows the standardized residuals for the least squares Focused model.,7
147,"The fit is reasonable over most of the area and, as might be expected, is broadly similar to that given by the Shotgun model.",7
148,"Again it tends to under-predict values for wards surrounding the centre of Leicester (Humberstone, Aylestone and Newton) and massively over-predicts for The Castle ward which includes the city centre.",7
149,Here an actual ward population of 10 149 is predicted to be 18 373.,7
150,A ‘Simple’ model,7
151,The final model investigated is the simplest of all.,7
152,In this the ‘dense’ and ‘residential’variables (equivalent to ‘houses’) were summed and regressed against population in a simple linear model.,7
153,"Figure 5.6 shows that the plot of ‘houses’ against ‘population’is remarkably linear, with a correlation coefficient of 0.869.",7
154,"The ordinary least squares model, with forced zero intercept term, is pop 81 = 5.41 houses or, with Poisson errors: pop 81 = 5.40 houses   This result implies that each pixel classified as having people living in it, and there are 86 178 of these, will on average contain 5.4 people.",7
155,"Examined in detail (Fig. 5.7) this simple model repeats the problems of fitting the city wards identified by both the Shotgun and the Focused models, but adds to this a tendency towards relative over-prediction in the rural wards to the north and east of the area.",7
156,An areal interpolation application,7
157,The final step is to use the results of these models to predict the distribution of population over other arbitrary areal units for which pixel land-cover counts can be obtained.,7
158,A particularly severe test is to use the results to estimate the population of the area over the kilometre square grid given by the UK Ordnance Survey.,7
159,"In this, the estimation not only involves a cross-area element, it also embraces a considerable areal disaggregation, from an average ward size of 7.7 km&sup2;(range 0.74–38.7 km&sup2;) down to the individual kilometre square.",7
160,"Figures 5.8–5.10 have been produced using UNIRAS to show the predicted 1984 population for the Shotgun, Focused and Simple models outlined above.",7
161,"All three pick out the major features of the population density variation across northern Leicestershire but, , as they stand they are impossible to validate in any direct way.",7
162,"First, the 1981 Census of Population was not made available for grid squares and, second, our estimates were produced using a 1984 satellite image and 1981 Census ward data.",7
163,There are two indirect ways of validating these estimates.,7
164,"First, they can be compared with the actual distribution of population as reported on a grid square basis by the 1971 Census of Population (Fig. 5.11).",7
165,Figures 5.12–5.14 show the differences between the actual population for 1971 and the predicted population for 1984.,7
166,Table 5.4 provides a summary of the overall fit in the form of the root mean squares (RMS) of the differences for each map.,7
167,All point to precisely the same problems as were identified when evaluating the  original model fits.,7
168,The average ward population is 9488 (Table 5.1) and so the RMS errors are comparatively small (the range of RMS errors is from 815.13 for the Shotgun ordinary least squares (OLS) to 1035.29 for the Simple Poisson).,7
169,There is little difference in the values obtained using OLS    and Poisson regression and the Simple models produce only slightly higher errors.,7
170,Figure 5.12 shows the differences given using the Shotgun model which has the lowest RMS value.,7
171,"Throughout most of the area, the differences are 1000.",7
172,"In fact, only 30 (or 5.3 ) grid squares have absolute differences greater than this.",7
173,"Unfortunately, some urban squares in Leicester and Loughborough have large individual differences which have a total range from -4466 to +6976.",7
174,"Thirteen years, between the 1971 Census and the 1984 image used, is a long time and has encompassed considerable population change in both magnitude and distribution.",7
175,The general tendency of this model to overestimate central city population and underestimate around the urban fringe is consistent with the known pattern of change.,7
176,"Figure 5.13 shows the same data for the Focused model which, although it has much the same proportion of grid squares with differences 1000 people, now gives a total range from -4799 to +8339.",7
177,"Even Fig. 14, for the Simple model, has only 6.5 of squares with absolute differences greater than 1000 but, as might be expected, the range is now from -3506 to +11 204.",7
178,A second indirect way of validating the regressions is to produce models relating population to 1981 land cover calibrated using the 1971 populations.,7
179,"If the general approach is fairly robust, it ought to be that the relationship between population and land cover is fairly stable, we would expect the model coefficients to be similar to those obtained from the ward data.",7
180,"Table 5.5 presents these coefficients, estimated using ordinary least squares, for exactly equivalent models to those reported in section 5.6.",7
181,It can be seen that in every case the two sets of coefficients have the same sign and general magnitude.,7
182,"However, even allowing for the fact that the population and satellite data were collected 13 years apart, the differences are greater than we would have liked.",7
183,Conclusions and further work,7
184,We regard these results as encouraging.,7
185,They suggest that it is possible to use satellite remotely sensed data to help inform population mapping by allowing cross-area estimation and some element of areal disaggregation.,7
186,"the remotely sensed data add a great deal of information to these processes this is hardly surprising, but this general approach is relatively easy to carry out in a GIS environment.",7
187,We are currently extending this work in three ways.,7
188,"We are applying this technique in another part of the East Midlands, as a further test of the utility of this approach.",7
189,"We are working on other methods of classifying images, including textural classifiers, to improve the statistical modelling.",7
190,"Finally, we are trying to obtain independent 1 km grid square estimates for the 1981 population.",7

192,"Stan Openshaw, Martin Charlton and Steve Carver",7
193,Introduction,7
194,The absence of facilities within GIS software for handling the effects of input data uncertainty and possible error propagation by GIS operations creates a question mark over the safe utilization of many aspects of the technology.,7
195,"The problem arises because it is thought that the positional errors and attribute uncertainties which are characteristic of all spatial databases, may be propagated and amplified by GIS operations and thus adversely affect some or all applications.",7
196,These input data uncertainties are attributable to a number of sources ranging from errors in the original cartographic map documents through to the effects of the GIS operations themselves.,7
197,"Specific types of error in digital map data include: locational uncertainty, measurement errors in digitization, map-scale-dependent accuracy and resolution, and classification and generalization error in both categorical and remotely sensed map data.",7
198,For thematic maps the principle cause of error is the original map document and its conversion to digital form.,7
199,For remotely sensed data error depends on the accuracy of the sensing device and the pixel classification technology used in image processing.,7
200,There is nothing new about the existence of map-related errors.,7
201,Error and uncertainty have always been a feature of cartographic information.,7
202,"Previously, however, the worst effects were largely avoided by a combination of the expertise of the cartographer, who knew about the inherent generalization implicit in analogue maps, while the difficulty of manipulating maps by manual means precluded most forms of analysis likely to be sensitive to the effects of error.",7
203,The advent of GIS has significantly changed all this.,7
204,The ease of use and flexibility of GIS allow the user to perform operations on map data that were previously impossible on a large scale.,7
205,"The typical end-user of GIS output will probably care or know little about the cartographic and uncertainty characteristics of the map data being used, while the GIS itself  has no procedures for handling the varying accuracy and reliability of the digital map data being processed.",7
206,"A GIS gives the user complete freedom to combine, overlay and analyse data from many different sources, regardless of scale, accuracy, resolution and quality of the original map documents and without any regard for the accuracy characteristics of the data themselves.",7
207,"The mixing of geographical information from different map scales and sources is a key aspect of GIS functionality, but it does raise the question what effects the combination of different levels of data uncertainty has on both the output maps and on the data derived from spatial query and analysis.",7
208,"It must be recognized that there are many good reasons for wishing to combine data in these ways, but a major problem arises because GIS packages fail to offer any means of keeping track of the effects of error propagation and how it affects the results.",7
209,"Despite research into some aspects of the error propagation issue in spatial data processing (e.g. Blakemore 1984; Chrisman 1984; Drummond 1987; Goodchild and Dubuc 1987; Walsh 1987), Burrough (1986:103) correctly points out that ‘It is remarkable that there have been so few studies on the whole problem of residual variation and how errors arise, or are created and propagated in geographical information processing, and what the effects of these errors might be on the results of studies made.’",7
210,This neglect is widely perceived to be a major unresolved problem.,7
211,"Such is its importance that the National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis (NCGIA) in the USA, has placed this issue first in its list of research priorities (NCGIA 1989).",7
212,This chapter is concerned with developing methods able to provide estimates of the confidence regions around GIS map-based outputs by taking into account certain selected sources of uncertainty affecting spatial databases.,7
213,A Monte Carlo simulation-based approach is used as a general means of estimating the effects of input data uncertainty on the map outputs after an arbitrary sequence of GIS operations.,7
214,The objective is to identify and handle the effects of data uncertainty in a GIS by defining uncertainty envelopes to create ‘credibility regions’ around the results.,7
215,This is considered to be the minimum needed to allow a GIS to function in a mixed data environment.,7
216,Sources of error in GIS,7
217,"Error and uncertainty are common features of cartographic information, so it is hardly surprising that these aspects are also present in digital versions of analogue maps.",7
218,"It follows, therefore, that no map-related spatial data exist which are wholly error-free.",7
219,There are many different causes of uncertainty and those which are explicitly GIS-based manipulations of geographic information are merely a more recent problem.,7
220,"However, it is also obvious that the power of GIS has the potential dramatically to increase both the magnitude and importance of errors in spatial databases.",7
221,Burrough (1986) identifies three main groups of factors that govern the errors which may be associated with spatial data processing.,7
222,These are:,7
223,1.,7
224,"Obvious sources of error;,",7
225,2.,7
226,Errors resulting from natural variations or from ordinal measurements; and,7
227,3.,7
228,Errors arising through processing.,7
229,"Group 1 errors include such sources of age as the data, areal coverage, map scale and density of observations.",7
230,"Group 2 errors include positional accuracy, attribute uncertainty, and generalization arising from data classification and spatial variations in map quality.",7
231,"Group 3 errors include those arising through the processing of geographical data, numerical computing errors, faulty topological analyses and errors in interpolation.",7
232,"The three groups represent errors of increasing complexity and difficulty of handling, those in groups 2 and 3 require intimate knowledge of the data, their structure and the algorithms used and some means of converting this knowledge into quantitative measures of impact.",7
233,It is useful to start by examining some of these sources of error.,7
234,Digitizing error,7
235,Despite the availability of hardware for the automated conversion of geographic data from paper maps to digital form (e.g. optical scanners) much data input to GIS is still done by hand using a digitizing table.,7
236,"As a result of human and other complicating factors involved, a high level of error is often present in digital map data.",7
237,Manual digitizing is consequently recognized as a significant source of map error in GIS (Otawa 1987; Keefer 1988).,7
238,"However, error introduced into digital map databases through the digitizing process is often ignored because the characteristics of digitizing error have not been fully defined and because no practical means of handling input data uncertainty exist within proprietary GIS software.",7
239,Sources of error in the digitizing process can be broken down into two main streams: source map error and operational error.,7
240,"Source map error includes the accumulated error of the map being digitized, while operational error includes those errors propagated during the digitizing process itself.",7
241,"In looking at the first of these it must be recognized that no map, however detailed or carefully compiled, can perfectly represent the ‘ground truth’, while in the second instance, the digitizing process merely serves to compound the errors present in the original map (Poiker 1982; Blakemore 1984).",7
242,"Going back to the source map, the level of detail and accuracy depends very much on the map scale.",7
243,Large-scale maps can be topologically very detailed and have complex legends while smaller-scale maps are more generalized.,7
244,This scale-related generalization gives rise to both locational errors and attribute uncertainty.,7
245,Consider line thickness on paper maps.,7
246,"All lines on maps, depicting features roads, contours and boundaries, are drawn to be easily visible to the user.",7
247,The thickness of some lines are even emphasized to accentuate their importance (e.g. major roads).,7
248,This can be misleading (e.g. a road shown as a line 1 mm thick on a 1: 50000 scale map implies a width of 50 m on the ground — an obvious exaggeration) and as a result leads to difficulties in the digitizing process.,7
249,Common sense suggests that the true course of a line on a map is along its mid-point.,7
250,"However, as the operator traces a line extra errors arise because it is impossible to follow the centre of the line exactly and some displacement of the cursor on either side of the line is inevitable.",7
251,Burrough (1986) suggests that the area of the map covered by lines can be assumed to be an area of uncertainty.,7
252,"In one example he states that a 1: 25 000 scale soil map measuring 400 by 600 mm may have as much as 24 000 mm of drawn lines, covering 24 000 mm&sup2; or 10 of the total map area.",7
253,Blakemore (1984) attempts to estimate the uncertainty caused by cartographic line thickness and associated digitizer error by adapting an idea forwarded originally by Perkal (1966).,7
254,Perkal defined a distance (’ epsilon’) about a cartographic line as a means of objective generalization.,7
255,"Blakemore inverted the concept, suggesting that it can be used to indicate an error band about a digitized line.",7
256,This can be applied to polygon overlay operations to ascribe descriptive levels of certainty to the resulting map.,7
257,A point-in-polygon problem was used as an example which results in five classes of answer the position of the point the digitized boundary and the ‘epsilon’ distance (Fig. 6.1).,7
258,Empirical investigation using UK Department of Industry 1 km square data overlaid on polygon boundaries of north-west England employment office areas revealed that only 60 of the points in the industry database could be positively assigned to an employment office area by being within a polygon and the boundary by a distance greater than epsilon.,7
259,The accuracy of a digital representation of a line depends not only on the ability of the person using the digitizer to follow the centre of the line on the map exactly but also on the number of points they input to describe the shape of the line (Aldred 1972).,7
260,"Converting a line on a map into a series of ,coordinates involves a sampling process.",7
261,The number of sample points required accurately to copy a straight line is much less (2) than that required for a curve or complex line feature (>>2).,7
262,The relative error associated with digitizing straight lines (e.g. power lines) is considerably less than that associated with digitizing line features made up of complex curves (e.g. coastlines).,7
263,"Although a number of methods are available for sampling only those vertices which describe the basic shape of the line (e.g. Douglas and Peucker 1973), the difference between digitizing straight lines and complex curves suggests that Blakemore's use of distance ‘epsilon’ is an over-simplification of reality.",7
264,This could be improved by more detailed consideration of the processes of error propagation inherent in digitizing procedures.,7
265,Several empirical studies have examined digitizing error by comparing digital data to their source maps (Traylor 1979; Otawa 1987; Keefer 1988).,7
266,From such studies appropriate models of digitizer error could be formulated.,7
267,Errors in digital overlay analysis,7
268,Much of the functionality of GIS lies with their ability to overlay one or more digital maps for the purposes of Boolean or network analyses.,7
269,"This kind of map analysis used to be done manually (before the advent of practical GIS) by overlaying transparent map sheets, establishing the required spatial relationships and drawing the new map on a clean top sheet with felt pens (McHarg 1969).",7
270,Digital cartography promised a more efficient and flexible way of doing this kind of work.,7
271,"However, making the step between simple paper overlays and digital overlay proved difficult.",7
272,Much research and development was carried out into this problem during the 1970s (e.g. McAlpine and Cook 1971; Goodchild 1978).,7
273,"Results from this work have, however, created more questions about data quality and error propagation.",7
274,"These questions need to be answered, , before GIS can realize their full potential.",7
275,McAlpine and Cook (1971) experimented with the polygon overlay problem by overlaying different sized hexagons over a hexagonal grid with random orientation and displacement.,7
276,"Their results showed a surprisingly large proportion of small, ‘sliver’ polygons on the output maps.",7
277,"When applied to a case study, involving the overlay of three maps of Papua New Guinea containing 7, 42 and 101 polygons respectively, the output map was comprised of 304 polygons, of which those 3.8 km&sup2;; amounted to 38 of the total area.",7
278,McAlpine and Cook evaluated these results by classifying the derived polygons by size and boundary complexity.,7
279,A 10 random sample of derived polygons was evaluated to determine the measure of agreement between the initial and derived descriptions.,7
280,It  was found that approximately 30 of the map area was made up of polygons which did not agree with the initial map descriptions.,7
281,Goodchild (1978) suggests that the number of derived polygons is more a function of boundary complexity than the actual number of polygons.,7
282,When the boundaries of overlaid polygon networks are highly correlated (e.g. certain types of administrative areas) serious problems are created through the introduction of large numbers of ‘spurious’ sliver polygons.,7
283,"In the case of administrative boundaries, different units present in different maps often share a common boundary (e.g. a river or stretch of coastline).",7
284,"These common boundaries will have been digitized separated, and so will not, therefore, coincide exactly.",7
285,"Furthermore, the more accurately common boundaries are digitized in each map and the more coordinates are used, then the larger the number of spurious sliver polygons produced (Goodchild 1978).",7
286,"Elimination procedures are available in GIS software to remove sliver polygons on the basis of minimum area (e.g. ARC/INFO, ESRI 1987).",7
287,"It is likely, however, that the resulting common boundary will be moved from its true position by the elimination procedure, thereby introducing further uncertainty into the output map.",7
288,An attempt to estimate the cumulative effect of thematic map errors in digital overlay analysis has been made by Newcomer and Szajgin (1984).,7
289,"Using conditional probability theory they suggest that the accuracy of maps resulting from overlay analysis is determined by the number of map layers, their accuracy and the coincidence of errors at the same position in several map layers.",7
290,As a result the accuracy of a composite map from overlay analysis is generally less than the accuracy of the least accurate map layer used (Newcomer and Szajgin 1984).,7
291,Newcomer and Szajgin go on to define the lower and upper bounds of accuracy in the output map.,7
292,"The upper bound is equal to the accuracy of the least accurate map layer (when all errors in other layers are coincident in their location), while the lower bound results when the errors in each map layer occur at unique locations.",7
293,Other researchers have compared spatial databases with ground truth observations.,7
294,", Walsh (1987) made an assessment of the error inherent in Landsat data, digital terrain models (DTMs) and digital thematic soil maps by comparing the data from these sources with information collected in the field.",7
295,They found that the error ranged from 43 for the soil maps to 83 for the DTMs.,7
296,Using the techniques described by Newcomer and Szajgin (1984) Walsh (1987) found that the combination of inherent and operational error ranged from 71 (upper bound) to 83 (lower bound).,7
297,The problem is knowing what these results mean in the context of a particular application.,7
298,Errors associated with vector to raster conversion,7
299,There are generally recognized to be two major sources of error when converting vector maps (either paper or digital) into gridded or raster  format.,7
300,These are coding errors and topological mismatch errors.,7
301,"The first, and probably most obvious, source of error is associated with the problem of coding those grid cells which contain parts of several different vector polygons each in similar proportions.",7
302,How should the grid cell be coded?,7
303,This problem arises because each grid cell can only have a single attribute value and because the chosen grid dimensions are too large to resolve the spatial detail required.,7
304,"One answer is to use a finer grid to achieve finer detail (Walsh 1987), but this causes a corresponding increase in the size of the raster database.",7
305,The second source of error is the problem of topological mismatch when a polygon map is represented by a grid.,7
306,"Again this can be reduced by using a finer grid, but problems with the increased amount of data storage required still occur.",7
307,Methodological outline,7
308,In conclusion to their paper Walsh (1987) state that ‘additional research in inherent and operational error assessment is warranted.,7
309,"Research in methods for cartographic display of errors, and the setting of statistical confidence limits of databases, are particularly required’(Walsh 1987; 1429).",7
310,Expanding on this it is possible to identify five major tasks in the study of error propagation within GIS.,7
311,These are:,7
312,1.,7
313,The development of mathematical models to represent the uncertainty characteristics of digital map databases;,7
314,2.,7
315,The development of procedures for estimating the effects of input data uncertainties and their propagation through GIS;,7
316,3.,7
317,The application of these models and techniques to a representative range of case studies to derive empirical estimations of likely error levels in GIS output;,7
318,4.,7
319,The development of techniques to utilize output data uncertainty estimates; and,7
320,5.,7
321,The incorporation of the technology as standard GIS tools.,7
322,Task 1 is of critical importance.,7
323,A means of modelling the distribution of errors is needed.,7
324,One way of meeting this need is to take some commonly used map data sources (both analogue and digital) and perform numerical experiments on them to investigate the effects of scale and map resolution on data accuracy.,7
325,In doing so there are a number of important areas to consider: mathematical modelling of the distribution of positional errors in digital maps derived from source maps of different scales; the level and distribution of error which characterize digital map data; and the types of probability models which best represent these errors.,7
326,"The long-term aim of this research should be to obtain a reasonable representation of the various errors that exist, although practical considerations would limit the scope and complexity of the representations used.",7
327,"It should be possible to  obtain reasonable error models relating to positional accuracy, classification errors, attribute uncertainty and normal sampling aspects of spatial data.",7
328,Such an approach conforms to Chrisman's concept of a total error model as a decomposable set of stochastic processes which operate simultaneously.,7
329,As more components of the total error model become available as a result of research then they could be adopted.,7
330,"As a result, any error-handling and estimation procedures should be sufficiently general as to be able to incorporate any new error model that may emerge at a later date.",7
331,Task 2 may be solved by using a Monte Carlo approach.,7
332,The generality and flexibility of such a procedure are a very attractive feature of the technology.,7
333,"Here, a Monte Carlo based simulation procedure for estimating the impact of error in GIS is proposed and developed.",7
334,The concept is simple and universal in its applicability.,7
335,"It does, however, present a number of operational difficulties that require basic research before it can be widely used.",7
336,The procedure is to simulate the effects of input data uncertainty by a Monte Carlo approach that is often used in statistics to perform exact significance tests.,7
337,Each input data source is assumed to be characterized by an error model that represents reasonable estimates of the levels and nature of the data uncertainty thought to be present.,7
338,This allows the map data to be replaced by probability distributions of known form and parameters.,7
339,"A single simulation is made by generating random numbers from these probability distributions and adding them to the observed geographic coordinates (defining point, line or area features) with these random values.",7
340,This process is repeated for each source of data input.,7
341,The randomized input map data are then an arbitrary sequence of GIS operations.,7
342,The final output results are saved.,7
343,The entire process is repeated times (where may be 100).,7
344,Research is required to determine the appropriate value of .,7
345,"If the GIS output is merely numeric, then the distribution of results gives some indication of the effects of input data uncertainty.",7
346,"If the result is a map, then the total set of output maps can be used to draw confidence intervals or ‘credibility regions’ which can be overlaid on the deterministic results as a visual indication of the effects of data uncertainty.",7
347,", suppose a series of map overlays is being used to define suitable locations for a facility.",7
348,The certainty of the output map being correct can be estimated using Monte Carlo simulation.,7
349,In a vector GIS the set of different output maps would be rasterized and a count made of the frequency that each cell appears in the final map.,7
350,Those cells in locations which are little affected by the sensitivity analyses would accumulate high counts.,7
351,They could then be converted back into vector form as polygon data and superimposed on the deterministic results.,7
352,There is a useful analogy here with Monte Carlo significance testing which could be used to add a further degree of inferential screening to assessing the descriptive significance of the uncertainty bands in the context of a particular application.,7
353,This simulation procedure is totally independent of the error models used and the nature and sequence of the GIS operations employed.,7
354,"The GIS component can include all manner of map manipulation, evaluation and  statistical procedures.",7
355,"However, there are a number of basic research tasks that need to be resolved before this technique can be widely applied.",7
356,These include: defining suitable values for the number of simulations required in a GIS environment a statistical hypothesis-testing one; assessing the utility of kernel estimators as an approximation that may allow smaller numbers of simulations to be used; investigating the possibility of predicting the final output regions without performing large numbers of simulations; and investigating possible hardware solutions to speed up the simulation process.,7
357,The Monte Carlo simulation technique offers an effective means of identifying and demonstrating the effects of data uncertainty in a number of case studies drawn from the natural and social sciences.,7
358,This is important as a means of drawing end-user attention to the problems of error propagation.,7
359,The resulting ‘error audits’ would also provide a platform for illustrating to vendors the importance of installing error estimators in GIS software.,7
360,"A practical means of identifying approximate levels of output uncertainty also requires that some basic recommendations are made about how this variability can be retained, used and passed on to subsequent operations and applications using the data.",7
361,Some US research groups appear to be tackling part of this problem by tagging databases with error information.,7
362,Attention might be better focused on more technical questions how this error information may be used in GIS and spatial analysis.,7
363,", development of spatial retrieval techniques and nearest neighbour analyses which can operate with fuzzy data.",7
364,Other issues relate to investigating how this uncertainty information can best be presented to the user.,7
365,"Finally, the simulation approach and associated error models should be capable of being incorporated into standard GIS software.",7
366,The principal problem area concerns the additional amount of computation that may be necessary successfully to implement Monte Carlo based techniques.,7
367,"It is possible, however, that quick approximations could be devised that would reduce the work-load by a factor of 5, while improvements in hardware over the next few years may well absorb the rest.",7
368,Monte Carlo simulation methodology,7
369,Some preliminaries,7
370,"Although the methodology is of general applicability, it has been developed here using ARC/INFO running under the VMS operating system on a microVAX 2.",7
371,"Some of the terminology, therefore, relates to the ARC/INFO GIS software (see Table 6.1).",7
372,The basic sequence of operations,7
373,The nature of the simulation methodology is outlined in Fig. 6.2.,7
374,The simulation of input data uncertainty involves replacing the deterministic input data values by those from a probability distribution that reflects an appropriate error model.,7
375,The GIS operations are then performed and the results saved for evaluation.,7
376,The GIS software used in this case study is the widely used ARC/INFO package (ESRI 1987).,7
377,The methodology is operationalized in a macro which calls a separate program to perturb the input data without changing the topology.,7
378,"This is achieved by accessing the binary arc files directly from a FORTRAN program and then replacing the deterministic values by probabilistic ones, checking in the process that the implicit topology is retained.",7
379,There are a number of approaches to implementing the methodology in ARC/INFO.,7
380,The sequence of events is:,7
381,1.,7
382,"Perturb the arc data for the coverages, preserving polygon topology;",7
383,2.,7
384,Carry out the GIS operations on the perturbed coverage;,7
385,3.,7
386,Rasterize the results; Steps 1–3 are repeated 100 times.,7
387,4.,7
388,Calculate frequencies for each raster; and,7
389,5.,7
390,Map the results for a given probability level.,7
391,"Steps 1–3 are contained within the macro, written in the ARC/INFO macro-language, AML.",7
392,Step 1 is implemented in a separate macro.,7
393,Step 4 is implemented in a VAX DCL command procedure.,7
394,"The results are then   mapped on a micro, using a Postscript driver (Adobe Systems 1985) of the authors' own devising (step 5).",7
395,The first major problem is to access the arc data.,7
396,"In ARC/INFO, the binary arc/node topology information is kept in one subdirectory, while the tables which access these attributes are stored in another subdirectory.",7
397,"Initial attempts used the ARC UNGENERATE command to extract the binary data in ASCII character form for input to the FORTRAN perturbation program, followed by a GENERATE and BUILD to re-create the coverage.",7
398,"There are two disadvantages to this approach; first, it is enormously time consuming and second, the polygon topology of the input coverage is not preserved, so one cannot work back to the initial coverage attributes.",7
399,The easiest solution is to access the binary files directly.,7
400,All the information is then contained in only one file.,7
401,"The ARC/INFO programmer's guide (Aronson 1985) give some clues what to expect, but the actual file structure can only be determined by inspection.",7
402,"Fortunately, the VAX command DIR/FULL gives enough information to allow a FORTRAN program to be written which can read the data block by block, and then replace the arc coordinates by randomized values drawn from some appropriate probability distribution.",7
403,The complexity of the record structure provides extra problems for coding the perturbation program.,7
404,Integer and real data representations are mixed together in the logical records in the data.,7
405,"The trick is to recognize which are which, and deal with them accordingly.",7
406,"The header/trailer and topology information also be preserved exactly, and only the coordinate data perturbed.",7
407,"finally, the node information can be perturbed only once, which involves creating a node table into which the perturbed nodes are stored as they are read in, and from which they can be retrieved in later references to the same node.",7
408,The GIS overlay operations follow next.,7
409,"In this case, the operations are a series of overlays, designed to remove infeasible areas from the base coverage.",7
410,Lastly the polygon data in the output coverage are rasterized and the rasterized coverage stored.,7
411,Rasterization is used to provide an easy way of visualizing the uncertainty in the output results.,7
412,"The object of the final analysis is to create a data set which contains, for each raster, the number of times it is simulated to be inside the areas resulting from the sequence of GIS operations.",7
413,There are several ways of achieving this.,7
414,"The methodology used here is a three-stage operation; first, the binary raster files or single variable files (SVFs) are expanded into character form, compressed (Held 1983), and a row number added; second, the files area is sorted by the row number all records with the same row number are contiguous in the file; third, a count is made of all the rasters in each row which are simulated to be inside the required areas.",7
415,These frequencies can then be mapped to yield credibility regions corresponding to particular significance levels.,7
416,A case study,7
417,Searching for radwaste sites,7
418,Openshaw (1989) discuss the use of ARC/INFO to identify feasible sites for radwaste dumps.,7
419,The GIS operations constitute little more than a sequence of map overlays in the form of a Boolean search.,7
420,This process is re-examined here with particular attention to northern England to reduce the computational resources required.,7
421,"The object of the overlay exercise is to determine potentially feasible sites for the dumping of waste material from the nuclear industry, , low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste.",7
422,"This chapter is not itself concerned with the mechanics or politics of the matter, the example chosen is merely a convenient one for purposes of illustrating a very common GIS procedure.",7
423,For the dumping of such radioactive matter four criteria need to be considered:,7
424,1.,7
425,The waste dump must be on a site with a suitable underlying geology;,7
426,2.,7
427,The site must be accessible from the UK rail network;,7
428,3.,7
429,"The site must not be within a conservation area (, a national park, area of outstanding natural beauty, etc.…); and",7
430,4.,7
431,The site must be areas of population concentration.,7
432,Four coverages are used in the case study.,7
433,"The underlying suitable geologies, defined by the British Geological Survey (Chapman 1986), were digitized from 1: 625 000 scale maps.",7
434,"The rail network was digitized from 1: 250 000 maps, and buffered at 3 km.",7
435,The national park data were digitized from 1: 250 000 maps.,7
436,"The population counts those grid squares with a population greater than 490 residents, representing a population density of greater than 4.9 persons/ha.",7
437,The coverages are shown in Fig. 6.3 and the error estimates for them are contained in Table 6.2.,7
438,The first step involves processing a suitable geology coverage (GEOLOGY).,7
439,The ARC/INFO ERASE command (the Boolean equivalent of NOT) is used to remove the constrained areas from the coverage to build up a composite coverage.,7
440,The elimination sequence is presented in Fig. 6.4.,7
441,"Those areas which are outside the rail buffer, RAILBUF, are removed (to give ERASRG), and next the conservation areas, CONSV (to give ERASRGC).",7
442,"finally, the densely populated areas, POP490, are deleted to give a set of feasible areas for site investigation (ERASRGCP).",7
443,"The characteristics of each of the coverages are shown in Tables 6.3–6.6, and the ARC command sequence to obtain the final overlay is in Table 6.7.",7
444,It is difficult to attempt to determine what are suitable estimates of the error in the map.,7
445,ARC/INFO works to a minimum tolerance — the smallest distance between any pair of coordinates — known as the fuzzy tolerance.,7
446,"As a default, the fuzzy tolerance is 1/50 000 of the width of the base map, in this case, 0.48 mapunit.",7
447,"As the mapunits are 10 m, the fuzzy tolerance represents 4.8 m on the ground.",7
448,"The population data arc rather more problematic, since they are generated from the ‘centroids’ of census enumeration districts (EDs); the boundaries of the census EDs do not conveniently follow a grid, it is assumed they have a similar fuzzy tolerance to the other coverages.",7
449,"Clearly, the quantization noise which is introduced to the data requires a rather more sophisticated error model.",7
450,The case study uses the error estimates in Table 6.2 as a guide to likely levels of uncertainty until further research yields more realistic models.,7
451,The simulation is run 100 times.,7
452,In each simulation:,7
453,1.,7
454,Leftovers from any previous run are removed;,7
455,2.,7
456,A copy is taken of each of the unperturbed coverages;,7
457,3.,7
458,All nodes and vertices of each coverage are perturbed;,7
459,4.,7
460,The file structures are reorganized into a form the ARC i/o routines can deal with.,7
461,This step is highly VAX/VMS specific and could probably be replaced by some more universal coding in the perturbation software.,7
462,5.,7
463,The overlay sequence takes place; remnants of any previous failures are removed; and,7
464,6.,7
465,"The output vector coverage is rastered, plotting.",7
466,Step 6 introduces a series of problems.,7
467,The rasterization process introduces noise.,7
468,"For the experiments here, a raster size of 1 km (100 mapunits) is used.",7
469,"the fuzzy tolerance is 25 mapunits, then the raster size should be that or less, to remove the quantization noise.",7
470,"However, reducing the raster size from 100 to 25 mapunits increases the disc space required to store the raster files by a factor of 16 increasing processing times.",7
471,ARC/INFO is not well tuned to handle this sort of problem.,7
472,Simulation results,7
473,The error model used here is an obvious over-simplification of reality.,7
474,"Each vertex in the coverage was perturbed by selecting random numbers from a uniform distribution, with ranges defined in Table 6.2.",7
475,"Steps were taken to ensure that the nodes were not perturbed once, but no checks were made to determine whether the perturbation process caused sliver polygons to be created.",7
476,The fuzzy tolerance of 25 mapunits was chosen to try to eliminate these from the final coverage.,7
477,"The process required 16 140 s of CPU time and 20 h of elapsed time on a lightly loaded microVAX 2, under VMS.",7
478,The resulting maps are shown in Fig. 6.5.,7
479,"There are seven maps, showing 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 and 100 , ‘credibility regions’.",7
480,The credible region is that which contains the feasible region or more times ; in this case is 100.,7
481,"As the ‘credibility level’ increases, so fewer and fewer areas are included in the map, reflecting       the increasing confidence in the map.",7
482,"More areas are included in the map where the user is willing to be wrong 10 times 100, but far fewer in that which they are willing to run the risk of being wrong once in a hundred times; a comparison of the 90 and 99 maps will make this clear (figs 6.5a and f).",7
483,"There is little difference between the 90, 95, 96 and 97 maps (Figs 6.5a-d), but between the 97 and-98 maps a considerable region in the north-east corner of the map is lost (Figs 6.5d-e).",7
484,"Between 99 and l00 , virtually all the map (figs 6.5f-g) is lost with the exception of the region in the south-east corner of the map.",7
485,The overlay process has been most reliable here.,7
486,Comparing this map with the ERASRGCP map from Fig. 6.4 will reveal the effect of trying to take uncertainty in the input data into account explicitly on the resulting map pattern.,7
487,There are far fewer areas in the simulated map about which one would risk a definitive statement than in the map from the unsimulated process.,7
488,Discussion,7
489,The main problem with using a Monte Carlo approach is its slowness.,7
490,A lightly loaded microVAX 2 can expect to take over 24 h of elapsed time to carry out 100 simulations on a small problem.,7
491,Fortunately the process is explicitly parallel and were it to be run on multiprocessor hardware then there could be substantial speed-up.,7
492,"The simulation process is parallel, since one simulation does not depend on the outcome of a previous one.",7
493,The selection of a suitable error model is problematic.,7
494,One approach is to carry out experiments with a digitizing table to determine empirically an appropriate distribution for digitizing errors.,7
495,Synthetic data which are themselves a GIS-derived product may be the most difficult to deal with.,7
496,The grid square population data used here are a case in point.,7
497,These data  had to be estimated from census ED information.,7
498,The aggregation process merely allocates to a grid square the populations of the ED whose ‘centroid’ happens to fall in that grid square.,7
499,"In the case where two or more EDs fall in the same grid square, then the grid square's population is the sum of those of the individual EDs.",7
500,"It can also be argued that the error present in this data, given its crudity, would swamp any of the other data.",7
501,"However, it is only fair to point out that the population distribution is uneven, and any swamping will take place in urban areas.",7
502,"In the context of radwaste disposal, this is not critical, but for some other operations, it obviously is.",7
503,There might be alternatives to using a grid.,7
504,Very few ‘natural’ data come in grid form.,7
505,"One might buffer the ED centroids, assign populations to the resulting zones, then determine the population densities.",7
506,The choice of buffer distance would need to be the subject of some experiment.,7
507,"The use of Theissen polygons has been suggested, although the statistical properties of processes giving rise to such areas are poor surrogates for digitized ED boundaries.",7
508,"The varying size of EDs in urban and rural areas, and the discontinuous nature of the population distribution inside the larger rural EDs is also difficult to parametrize.",7
509,The selection of a raster size presents some other problems.,7
510,The authors used an IBM 4216–010 PagePrinter as an output device.,7
511,"This is a device which supports PostScript, and which has a specified resolution of 300 pixels/inch, both the vertical and horizontal direction.",7
512,"In the case study maps, 1 pixel represents a square of size 118 m.",7
513,"With a l200 dpi printer (a phototypesetter), each pixel would represent a square of size 29.5 m.",7
514,These set minimum sizes for output.,7
515,It should be noted that all the experiments thus far have used vector representations.,7
516,"It may be easier to implement it in a raster environment, but much would depend on the size of the rasters chosen to represent the areas.",7
517,Clearly this is yet another area for further research.,7
518,Conclusions,7
519,This chapter has introduced some of the issues surrounding the propagation of error in GIS and described the preliminary application of a Monte Carlo approach to assessing their effects.,7
520,"The empirical research carried out here is intended to test the feasibility of this approach, providing some general indications of what the effects might be and of one way by which they can be represented on the final output map.",7
521,In so doing it is recognized that many of the questions raised are left open for subsequent investigation and that the results are initial and tentative.,7
522,"Although conceptually clear, the method is not easy to implement with current hardware.",7
523,"There is likely to be substantial increases in CPU times, although it might be possible to reduce this by a factor of 5.",7
524,"However, with faster hardware likely to be on the market in the near future and the possibility of the emergence of parallel GIS machines, there is some justification for  believing that extra effort is both worth while and acceptable.",7
525,The challenge is to resolve the outstanding questions and perfect the technology as soon as possible.,7
526,"Perusal of Fig. 6.5 indicates that it does appear to work, and that it offers a pragmatic solution that could probably be developed further into a general-purpose GIS ‘error button’.",7

529,Introduction,7
530,"Geographical information systems (GIS) make considerable demands on the user: the wide variety of data types recorded in digital maps, the complex data structures used to organize them and the range of operations available, amount to a formidable obstacle for most users with standard requirements.",7
531,"As such, the quality of interfaces to GIS has taken on a considerable importance awareness, training and usage, both to the providers of GIS software and users of GIS alike (Rhind,1989).",7
532,"However, there are many aspects to the definition of an interface for systems as complex as GIS, and the solutions to this problem are developing extremely rapidly at the time of writing.",7
533,"Accordingly, this chapter aims to set out the requirements for a fully configured GIS interface, and profiles the development of a new GIS user interface system called UGIX.",7
534,This model is also used to define a research agenda for the next 5 years; the reader may judge the accuracy of this analysis by the commercial reality of available systems during the early and mid-1990s.,7
535,There is a wide recognition that the problems of poor interfaces are of considerable importance to the development of GIS.,7
536,The UK Government Committee of Enquiry chaired by Lord Chorley (DoE 1987) on the suggested in recommendation 59 that GIS technology projects be promoted since the report noted that the existing interfaces to GIS systems were poor.,7
537,The shortcomings of GIS user environments can be divided into two groups:,7
538,1.,7
539,Task complexity — the system functions implementing spatial operations are often complex and obscure;,7
540,2.,7
541,Poor database view tools — few systems make available database views meaningful to the user.,7
542,"Accordingly, it is clearly desirable that improved",7
543,"interfaces be developed the range of spatial operations in a system can be organized into standardized functions or tasks, and the spatial database can be visualized.",7
544,"The quality of GIS user interfaces is also an important factor in the acceptance, uptake and efficiency of the integrated GIS which are currently on the market.",7
545,In a recent study by Willis and Nutter (1990) of 136 publicly funded utilities and municipalities in the UK 57 stated that they were inhibited in their GIS developments by ‘a lack of staff with the right expertise’.,7
546,"At a time when there is a national and international shortage of staff skilled in the computer handling of geographical data (Rhind and Mounsey 1989), ‘ease of use’ is a vital criterion for the selection of an appropriate GIS.",7
547,"It is generally accepted that a system which is easy to use can help cut recruitment and training costs, and help retain staff.",7
548,"Organizations which are in the process of implementing GIS strategies also appreciate that the ‘ease of use’ factor is a key control over how quickly GIS programmes can be implemented, and therefore the speed with which financial targets for paying off capital costs can be met.",7
549,It may also be true that ‘ease of use’ can influence the quality of work done and the effectiveness of a GIS as a decision support system.,7
550,"To illustrate this in the negative, Beard (1989) , showed how ‘use error’ in GIS was an important but neglected aspect of quality control in GIS.",7
551,"In summary, the user interface is a vital element of any GIS.",7
552,"Long ignored as an esoteric aspect of GIS design while GIS development was driven by the need to extend functionality, the user interface is now beginning to attract its due attention.",7
553,"However, the implementation of a GIS user interface involves considerably more than the improvement of the human-computer interaction (HCI) process.",7
554,"Since GIS are conceptually complex and involve diverse operations ranging from data modelling to geometric transformations, improving the HCI cannot be a complete solution to the improvements of GIS use.",7
555,"Consideration also needs to be given to the embedding of knowledge, task definitions and database view manipulations into such interfaces.",7
556,"A key assumption, therefore, which remains to be tested is whether a GIS user interface should condition GIS use.",7
557,"While there are many who would argue that a measure of technical knowledge is desirable in those who use a GIS and a protection against the misuse of a powerful tool, it must now be established that maximum ‘achievable’ use of a software system owes much to the creation of a structured use environment, with logic controls built into the interface.",7
558,"The user is then free to choose the environment which best matches their use characteristics or which improves their aggregate efficiency measured in time, error or quality terms.",7
559,Characteristics of a user interface,7
560,"A user interface, at its most basic, consists simply of a system for communication with the computer.",7
561,"Since the demise of the punch-card system for entering commands this has normally been undertaken using a keyboard and a screen driven by a cathode ray tube (CRT) or liquid crystal display (LCD), although voice entry of data and touch screens have also been used.",7
562,Typical computer operating systems use (and continue to use)‘command line interfaces’ where a user enters a syntactically correct command at a prompt to give an instruction.,7
563,"Many computer applications use this kind of interface which is common on all machine ranges and sizes, e.g. MS-DOS for IBM-compatible personal computers.",7
564,"However, in the last 5 years the command line interface has begun to be replaced by the graphical user interface (GUI).",7
565,The GUI is an audio-visual display on the computer screen which presents a screen metaphor for the actions which the computer or program can carry out.,7
566,"Typically the means of issuing commands using this system has been via a window-icon-mouse-pop-up menu (WIMP) display, where the mouse is used to point at icons or menus in windows (which are subsets of the screen working area).",7
567,The options available are indicated to the user by the range of identifiable screen objects (Helander 1988).,7
568,Early work on the concept of WIMP user interfaces developed from research on the Smalltalk-80 project at the XeroxPARC in California in the early 1980s (Goldberg and Robson 1983).,7
569,"Work by Smith (1983) and Sneiderman (1983) developed the concepts behind moving and selecting screen representations, which has become important to all graphics-oriented applications (GIS).",7
570,The GUI for the Apple Macintosh (first released in 1984) was the first to become widely used and its popularity helped ensure that other GUIs were developed for PC compatibles and UNIX platforms.,7
571,This development has defined a new and higher standard for interfaces which has become common in all areas of data processing.,7
572,Apple's publication (Apple Computer 1987) set out the 10 chief characteristics of its own GUI as follows:,7
573,1.,7
574,Metaphors from the real world;,7
575,2.,7
576,"Direct manipulation by the user;,",7
577,3.,7
578,See and point (remember and type);,7
579,4.,7
580,Consistency;,7
581,5.,7
582,WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get);,7
583,6.,7
584,User control;,7
585,7.,7
586,Feedback and dialogue;,7
587,8.,7
588,Forgiveness;,7
589,9.,7
590,Perceived stability;,7
591,10.,7
592,Aesthetic integrity.,7
593,"These principles have now been generally adopted across all platforms, although since the Macintosh GUI is embedded in the system architecture most of these characteristics are enforced in Macintosh software design and engineering.",7
594,"However, this is not generally the case, and a whole variety of GUIs have developed, each adopting a slightly different subset of these principles as guidelines.",7
595,The range of GUIs which have now developed are surveyed in Hayes and Baran (1989).,7
596,On the basis of the analysis of 12 GUIs they suggest that the GUI is composed of three main components.,7
597,"Firstly, the windowing system is a set of tools for creating windows and their characteristics — an example of this is X Windows.",7
598,The second main component of the GUI is the imaging model which controls the drawing of the screen representations fonts and icons; an example of this is Display Postscript.,7
599,The third component is the application program interface which acts as an interface to the program operations and controls feedback from the screen representations.,7
600,the buoyant demand for GUIs almost all vendors of computer systems now offer such an interface product.,7
601,"Some GUI components are becoming standard across a variety of vendor platforms; thus, the windowing system X Windows is shared by a number of systems running UNIX.",7
602,Several GIS have already begun to use GUIs to make their systems more user friendly using the standard platform interface tools as described above.,7
603,"One example is AlperRecords from Alper Systems of Cambridge, UK which uses SUN interface tools, and is based on pop-up hierarchical menus.",7
604,"However, a standard GUI can only translate the command structure into graphical cues and will still be a ‘function-oriented’ a ‘task-oriented’system.",7
605,(This means that the user sees ‘primitive’ spatial operations and not a whole spatial problem which may involve a sequence of primitive operations).,7
606,"Hence, the use of a GIS with a GUI can only improve user productivity in ‘use’ factors, by increasing the speed of use and reducing errors, and may only help the user with a previously substantial knowledge of GIS.",7
607,"Thus, the sheer complexity of spatial data and the operations available, this can only be a partial solution to the general problem of user interaction with a GIS (Gould 1989).",7
608,Recent research into GIS user interfaces,7
609,Research into the form and content of user interfaces for GIS has accelerated rapidly in the last couple of years.,7
610,Initially this work has followed from the general acceptance of the WIMP system as an effective form of human-computer interface.,7
611,Within GIS the unique appeal of the GUI has been the desire to improve the ease of use for systems involving complex graphical display and spatial manipulation.,7
612,Hence the primary interest has been in:,7
613,1.,7
614,The development of new task-oriented interfaces based on standard windowing systems; and,7
615,2.,7
616,The creation of standard query formats which are independent of the database structure.,7
617,Initial work in the GIS field on user interfaces has concentrated on the screen designs appropriate for spatial data handling.,7
618,"Thus, Egenhofer and Frank (1988) suggested a way in which the WYSIWYG principle of ‘what you see is what you get’ could be extended to GIS and outlined the components of their own system which included a study of the selection of objects and areas, legends and query specification.",7
619,"Subsequent work by Cassel and Parker (1989) carried out tests on the effectiveness of different designs of GUI, focusing especially on the use of icons to represent classes of spatial data.",7
620,"This work demonstrated some of the special problems which have to be solved to design good GUIs for GIS: thus, an icon of a single pine tree caused some confusion when presented to a forester since he could not identify its species!",7
621,This indicates how legends and graphical cues must generalize a complex reality to provide appropriate ‘cues for action’(Mark 1989).,7
622,"Gould (1989), in a review of the HCI literature, also noted the potential to move beyond simple GUIs in interface design and identified three areas of potential improvement.",7
623,"First, he considered that graphic interaction was presently a limited form of process-response system, and recommended that designers of GIS interfaces look for ways to exploit the sophisticated forms of human visual thinking (Verplank 1988).",7
624,"Second, he suggested that the interface itself exploit multi-media techniques of sound and video to issue and support commands.",7
625,"finally, he suggested that interface design ought to concentrate on handling ‘fuzzy’ queries and parsing ‘natural language’concepts.",7
626,One recent study of user interfaces by Campari (1990) has employed graphical concepts in the design of GIS operations.,7
627,"This work, described as a visual language approach to GIS, used a visual programming language to define map operations.",7
628,This consisted of a graphic workspace and primitive GIS operations shown as icons which the user selected from a palette and assembled in the workspace.,7
629,The whole set of commands encapsulated in the visual procedure was then executed sequentially.,7
630,"Hence, another key aspect of spatial user interface design is that it must seek both to structure and filter human perception of space and spatial relationships when expressing an operation and passing it to a GIS.",7
631,"Research into general aspects of the perception of spatial relationships began long before the special problems presented by GIS existed, and is exemplified by the classic work of Gould and White (1974) on ‘mental maps’.",7
632,In the GIS context such issues are becoming increasingly important as GIS use grows rapidly and reaches a wider audience: this concern has created a new sub-discipline of ‘spatial language’ research.,7
633,"Early work on spatial languages was based upon the principles of spatial inference and retrieval, and was not specifically digitally based (McDermott 1980).",7
634,"Thus, Palmer and Frank (1988) distinguish between the interpretation of a man-made image (whose meaning is to be reconstructed), and a ‘natural’ image (whose meaning has to be extracted and standardized with belief systems).",7
635,Since maps are man-made the chief objective of a spatial language is to guide in the elucidation of the meaning(s) attached.,7
636,"Palmer and Frank (1988) also identify the key components of a spatial language as a family of spatial objects, the geometry of space (as mapped and perceived) and the mappings of the objects into the space.",7
637,"The importance of the cognitive structuring of space is expressed by Mark and Frank (1989), who set out the research agenda for the ‘Spatial Languages’ Research Initiative of the US National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis (NCGIA).",7
638,Cognitive aspects of spatial perception place constraints on the definition of a spatial language intended to be used as part of a user dialogue with the computer.,7
639,"Thus, Mark (1989) suggests that the ‘image-schema’ can be used to structure perceptions of space and provides examples drawn from Johnson (1987) CONTAINER (associated with the preposition ‘IN’) and PLATFORM (associated with the preposition ‘ON’).",7
640,This consideration can affect the process of data modelling since the cognitive models available define the ‘entities thought to be relevant to the task in hand’.,7
641,"Mark (1989) applies this consideration to the digital line graph, extended (DLG-E) model of cartographic representation used by the US Geological Survey mapping programme and comments that the rules and feature classes adopted do not relate well to an image-schema, and hence will be difficult to generalize.",7
642,"Similarly, different linguistic traditions structure space in distinct ways (Mark 1988).",7
643,Examples of linguistic structuring (with examples in English) include:,7
644,1.,7
645,"Preposition, e.g. near, between, among;",7
646,2.,7
647,"Motion, e.g. across;",7
648,3.,7
649,"Demonstratives, e.g. this, that;",7
650,4.,7
651,"Viewpoint, e.g. further down the road;",7
652,5.,7
653,"Distribution of attention, e.g. reference frame a field.",7
654,Awareness of these characteristics of language can help in the design of a generic spatial language with which a wide variety of users can interact with a spatial database.,7
655,A clear objective in this field must surely be the evaluation of the language of groups of users.,7
656,"However, attempts to translate the Geographical Information Systems Tutor (GISTutor)(Raper and Green 1989) into a number of European languages have encountered two main difficulties: first, the local adoption of English for spatial terms (and therefore concepts?) the English lexicon of most commercially available GlS, and second the difficulty of providing for translation of terms with no direct counterpart.",7
657,The spatial query language tools which a GIS uses for general interaction with spatial data and for the elucidation of spatial relationships have also been the subject of recent research (Egenhofer 1989).,7
658,"However, spatial query tools are intrinsically linked to the data model employed: hence the use of multiple  spatial data structures has led to the proliferation of query processors.",7
659,The result has been that in many GIS spatial queries initiated by the user must be formulated a software-specific command language.,7
660,"However, the fact that many new systems use relational database storage for spatial and non-spatial data has led to a wide interest in the adaptation of the structured query language (SQL) for spatially-related query operations in GIS.",7
661,"Thus, SQL is now seen as one possible means of establishing spatial queries across many different spatial data models and data structures.",7
662,"Hence, Herring (1988) described the design of SQL extensions to a new object-oriented GIS; Abel (1988) has reported work on the creation of SQL-based spatial extensions to a relational database in the ‘Spatial Information in a Relational Open-architecture database management system’(SIRO-DBMS) project; and Ingram and Phillips (1988) have designed spatial extensions to a hybrid GIS data model.",7
663,"Egenhofer (1989) also reported the test development of a prototype extended SQL (XSQL), adding concepts of spatial relations, spatial operations, graph representation and context.",7
664,"However, when he tested the system he found that the queries became far too long and complex to parse and execute for user-initiated queries.",7
665,"This may indicate that user interfaces to query structures cannot yet replicate human processes of spatial reasoning in a reasonable time, or that in software terms it is inefficient to extend SQL, and that an alternative must be found.",7
666,"Hence the link between the user interface and the spatial query processor is a problem of key importance, and the subject of considerable debate.",7
667,"Egenhofer (1989), in work on the testing of query processors, suggests that it is not possible to hide the implementation structure of the query at the interface.",7
668,"However, note that Rhind (1989) suggest that a Universal Geographic Information eXecutive (UGIX) can be created to interface between the user and a wide variety of different systems.",7
669,"However, the UGIX concept is based on the key assumption that current GIS users are motivated and capable of exercising spatial reasoning.",7
670,These users want access to tools to extend the spatial database to make spatial analyses.,7
671,This may indicate that a different approach is required for ‘public’ spatial information systems used by ‘spatial professionals’.,7
672,These systems may have to be restricted to passive use based on the extraction of information in well-defined forms.,7
673,An example of this would be the systems recently installed in Shell petrol stations in the UK developed by Action Information Management which use touch screen technology to view ‘road atlas’ type maps marked with symbols indicating travel hazards on major routes.,7
674,The information content of maps is also an issue for user interfaces.,7
675,"Thus, Bertin (1983) defined the concept of a ‘map-to-see’ as ‘a clear graphic representation which can be comprehended in a short moment’.",7
676,"Such an efficient map design should provide the map user with answers to all possible questions related to the map, whatever their type or complexity, in a single moment of perception.",7
677,Every other kind of map must be a ‘map-to-read’ and requires some study; it is implicit in experiments carried out by Kraak  (1989) that such maps are not suitable for temporary display on a computer screen.,7
678,Kraak also showed that maps illustrating the values of a variable in 2D shaded polygons best formed a ‘map-to-see’ when they were displayed with the variable visualized in 3D.,7
679,The design of help systems and tutors for GIS also presents some significant challenges to the developers of GIS user interfaces.,7
680,"However, the availability of such systems may be a crucial component of the user interface (Rhind 1989).",7
681,"Difficulties include the need to show complex graphic operations, the explanation of algorithms and file structures, and the application of GIS techniques to decision-making in a variety of application areas.",7
682,One example of a solution to this problem is the creation of GISTutor which is described by Raper and Green (1989).,7
683,"Hence three main kinds of problems are encountered in the use of existing systems: first, the generally inappropriate design of GUIs for GIS purposes; second, the specification of the language of interaction for spatial operations and queries; and, third, the limited content and rigid structure of standard help systems.",7
684,"It is therefore suggested that the design of a user interface must be rooted in the creation of a user environment which integrates the data-modelling process, the availability of spatial operations and queries, and the system of assistance and concept support within the interface.",7
685,User interface development: a case study of UGIX,7
686,In an attempt to define the basis on which a comprehensive GIS user environment could be built Rhind (1989) proposed the Universal Geographic Information eXecutive (UGIX) as a system design.,7
687,"It contains three main modules viz. (A) containing the screen interfaces, dialogues and spatial command processor;(B) containing a help and information system for a GIS; and (C) an expert system shell or high-level system access module.",7
688,The structure of UGIX is illustrated in Fig. 7.1.,7
689,"This section describes the   approach taken in the UGIX project, through first and second generation implementations.",7
690,"The first generation approach to interface design within the UGIX project has been to prototype using Hypercard for the Apple Macintosh, where the Hypercard application (complete with in-built communications software) acts as a client to a host processor ‘running the GIS application software.",7
691,This approach is similar to the one used by Cowan and Love (1988) to create an interface to the S Carolina Historic Preservation Office GIS database.,7
692,"Hypercard with its standard set of buttons, scrolling boxes and cards makes use of the GlS less daunting for the less technically aware user.",7
693,", with the rich graphics environment available in Hypercard it is possible to show a graphic to illustrate the effect of various options available at any one point.",7
694,"It is also desirable to display all the commands available to the user at one time, with a pop-up explanation for each option.",7
695,Screen design has involved the standardization of button and text field formats card and background layout for different areas of activity :.,7
696,1.,7
697,Introduction and explanation (using a map guide);,7
698,2.,7
699,Map and file selection (using standard Macintosh file selection dialogue);,7
700,3.,7
701,Session screens for command processing;,7
702,4.,7
703,"Help environment (UGIX (B) based on GISTutor II);,",7
704,5.,7
705,Library for maps and images generated in the GIS (a button to redraw them).,7
706,Screen metaphors have been developed for each of these areas to make location in the system a graphical attribute.,7
707,Currently this system interface ‘shell’ is being implemented for the GIS ARC/INFO.,7
708,During the second phase of the UGIX project a new interface ‘shell’ is being developed as part of a generic GIS-independent approach to GIS user interfaces (Raper and Bundock 1991).,7
709,"The first-generation system known as ‘HyperArc’ is currently under test with users at ‘novice’and ‘competent’levels of expertise: feedback on the use of the system, the aim of the evaluation phase is to define a core area of functionality in common use to help optimize the system structure.",7
710,A key consideration for the development of a spatial language interface to GlS is that many different groups of users exist within the spatial data-handling community.,7
711,It is recognized within the UGIX design that to some high-level users skilled in the manipulation of spatial data a command line interface to a GIS offers the maximum flexibility and power available.,7
712,"However, it is considered that during the first stage of the expansion of GIS use the largest group of new users are non-computer-literate professionals who frequently have a highly developed insight into spatial data.",7
713,It should therefore be emphasized that the first objective within the UGIX project is to improve access to existing GlS by converting the current function-orientation   of the native system interface to a task-oriented interface usable by a spatially aware user (see Fig. 7.2 for a taxonomy of interfaces for ARC/INFO at the time of writing in 1990).,7
714,The second generation of the UGIX project aims to build on the experience of constructing such task-oriented interfaces to create generic interfaces capable of communication with any GIS.,7
715,"The basic principle of the UGIX design is that to make a GIS easy to use the process of making a database enquiry, plotting a map or carrying out spatial analysis must be broken down into manageable parts, linked by a pathway for the user to follow.",7
716,Following such a path and gaining experience with the alternative options is an excellent way to improve a user's end-to-end understanding of the components of spatial data processing.,7
717,to create this form of interface environment this project is engaged in the definition of a language of spatial interaction to handle a dialogue with a GIS through a system shell.,7
718,In the development of this shell it is considered that the selection of options itself should drive the commands presented to the user for action.,7
719,"Appropriate information needed for a user to make a decision is also retrieved before presenting the command options, , maps with the correct specifications (e.g. with topological relations already created, when this is necessary for the operation).",7
720,"Thus, the structuring of a wide range of task-related paths through a GIS has formed one of the main development objectives in this project.",7
721,Another key objective in developing a GIS user interface is to improve the data-handling procedures to support the user's concept of maps as views of spatial data.,7
722,"Thus, utilities to manage map files are being implemented within HyperArc which use icons to access ARC/INFO data.",7
723,"Search routines to find maps with particular names, to sort maps by type (e.g. point or polygon based), to access the map tiling system and to select the part of the sheet to view have also been created.",7
724,In the first generation of this project the user specifies spatial queries using system implementation concepts which are made comprehensible (and refined through testing).,7
725,"However, a new  query language interface based on SQL is under development for the second generation of UGIX (Raper and Bundock 1991).",7
726,Conclusions,7
727,This chapter has attempted to summarize the recent developments in user interfaces for GIS.,7
728,"It can be said in conclusion that these developments have become central to the future of the ‘GIS revolution’ of the late 1980s, since it is now clear that the massive (and desirable) growth of the use of GIS cannot be supported without improvements to the use environment experienced by the user.",7
729,"It is predicted that such developments will gain common ground in the elaboration of the GUI concept as it has in the computer-aided design world, but will quickly diversify the actual products which emerge.",7
730,"Already a variety of vendors are attempting to create user interfaces which go beyond GUIs, but not have appeared at the time of writing in 1990.",7
731,"Finally, it is important to note that the user interface ‘debate’ can also be interpreted as another facet of the data-modelling debate in GIS.",7
732,"User interfaces are not just pretty screen representations: as their use is extended they will come to express the whole nature of the system data model, and will probably become highly specialized as the interfaces move from function-oriented to task-oriented forms.",7
733,Hence in the 1990s the user may not gain freedom of interaction with spatial data but become a captive of a particular design and control purpose.,7
734,"Hence, the challenge for GIS user interface design is to gain credibility for generic forms of interface: it is this form of GIS use that will ensure wider and more informed use of GIS in the years ahead.",7

738,Potential Applications,7
739,Overview,7
740,Ian Masser,7
741,"Given the extent to which geographic information management is applications driven, it is important to consider in some depth the characteristics of some potential application fields.",7
742,In the process it will be necessary to examine not only the extent to which geographic issues feature on the policy issues agenda in these fields but also the institutional context which governs decision-making and the extent to which data are available for research and policy analysis purposes.,7
743,Questions on data availability are likely to be particularly important where users are heavily dependent on secondary sources.,7
744,In situations of this kind provisions governing access and format may exert powerful constraints on the use that can be made of these data.,7
745,The first four chapters in this part examine issues relating to geographic information handling four potential applications fields.,7
746,The authors were asked to review the current state of the art in their fields with particular reference to the likely requirements of the future policy issues agenda the demands that they make on geographic information management.,7
747,Authors were also asked to evaluate critically the state of geographic information provision the needs of users and to consider the impact of user requirements on the development of geographic information handling methodology.,7
748,In this way the chapters in this part present a number of perspectives which essentially complement and amplify the discussion in the previous part.,7
749,"In this case, however, methodological issues are tackled from a largely user standpoint, whereas in the previous part they were viewed as substantive problems in their own right.",7
750,In effect the product of the discussion in both parts is a matrix where the methodological issues are listed along one axis and particular applications fields on the other.,7
751,Figure 8.1 summarizes the main features of this matrix.,7
752,There are important differences between the chapters in this part both in the nature of the demands that they make on geographic information and also in the relative importance that is attached to geographic criteria other issues by planners and decision-makers in these fields.,7
753,"The first three chapters dealing with environmental monitoring, natural and technological hazards and settlements and infrastructure applications make use of a very wide range of geographic information.",7
754,A major feature of these applications is the extent to which they involve overlays of a variety of information drawn from different sources on a topographic map base.,7
755,for this reason they make particularly heavy demands on current GIS technology both the size of the data sets and the diversity of the data structures that are involved.,7
756,Brown's chapter on geodemographics discusses an application field where primary data collected for operational purposes are typically evaluated secondary data derived from sources the Census of Population.,7
757,The range of data sets involved and the demands that are made on GIS technology in applications of this kind are often more limited than those of previous applications fields.,7
758,"However, this is offset by the demands that are made on spatial analysis and modelling methodology.",7
759,Rhind's chapter on environmental monitoring and prediction discusses the role of geographic information management in promoting sustainable development on a global scale in the context of the issues identified in the Brundtland report.,7
760,It points to the impact that the findings of global environmental research are likely to have on most sectors of the UK economy.,7
761,This contribution also indicates the wide variety of groups that are involved in monitoring environmental change and draws attention to the role that the European Community is increasingly playing in co-ordinating these efforts.,7
762,One of the examples of work in progress discusses research that has been  carried out for the European Commission as part of the CORINE Project.,7
763,"This highlights the challenges for research in a field categorized by a lack of data for some countries, varying definitions and standards in use, and unreasonably high user expectations.",7
764,The chapter as a whole draws attention to a number of key methodological issues that are involved in environmental monitoring and prediction.,7
765,"These include the highly specialized nature of much of the technical analysis, the limited capacity for checking the accuracy of many of the findings of this kind of research and the consequent need for the development of knowledge-based inference machines for extracting useful information from secondary and often proxy data.",7
766,"In Chapter 10 Gatrell and Vincent consider a wide range of natural and technological hazards including industrial hazards, risk assessment, hazardous waste disposal, emergency planning, natural hazards and environmental epidemiology.",7
767,"The substantive content of much of this research straddles the social, environmental and mathematical sciences.",7
768,"To model the dispersal of a plume of toxic gas generated by a chemical explosion and its impact on the surrounding area, , an understanding of atmospheric dispersion models, epidemiology and population distribution would be required.",7
769,In applications of this kind the authors argue that geographic information management and GIS have an important role to play and they give a number of examples from research in progress to illustrate the current state of the art in this field.,7
770,"The discussion of operational problems and prospects further amplifies many of the issues raised in preceding chapters, particularly the problems caused by the dependency on secondary data sources and the need for much more detailed geographic information to overcome some of the problems associated with linking data sets.",7
771,"Like most of the other contributors to this section, Gatrell and Vincent see decision support systems as a major area for future development in the geographic information management field.",7
772,"‘most GIS are rather dumb systems, requiring intelligent, very computer literate users’, managing natural and technological hazards means that this knowledge base must be built into the system it can be utilized quickly by untrained users after a disaster has taken place or in an emergency.",7
773,The settlement and infrastructure field is also characterized by a wide range of users with a great diversity of interests.,7
774,These include not only central and local government but also major utility companies and transport suppliers.,7
775,"Shepherd these users share a common need for up-to-date information on the amount, capacity and condition of urban land, transport networks, utilities, hospitals, schools and other major communal facilities.",7
776,"these data requirements, such users are also interested in developing their capabilities for modelling the changing relationships between the supply and demand for infrastructure in the context of both public and private sector decision-making.",7
777,"Shepherd, more than any other contributor to this section, draws attention to the extent to which current efforts in the geographic information  management field are constrained by the highly fragmented nature of both data suppliers and users both in sectoral and spatial terms, the great diversity of data sets in varying formats and the difficulties presented by institutional factors copyright provision, data ownership and the control of access to data.",7
778,Digital data occupy a central position in this applications field and a number of examples are given to illustrate the extent to which their development has been hampered or facilitated in various countries by the policies of the organizations with responsibility for digital data provision.,7
779,In Chapter 12 Brown reviews the development of geodemographics from its origins in the computer-based social area analysis of US census tract data from 1950 onwards.,7
780,"He describes the features of the four main systems that are currently in use in the UK and illustrates their application examples drawn from retail analysis and store location, market research, credit rating and target marketing.",7
781,Brown demonstrates the extent to which the growth of research activities in this field has led to the emergence of improved cluster analytic methods for the multidimensional classification of people the type of area in which they live.,7
782,"In the last part of this contribution, Brown identifies a number of priorities for future research.",7
783,"Like Gatrell and Vincent and Shepherd before him, he is concerned with the lack of detailed geographical information particularly in this case the years between censuses.",7
784,Spatial linkages also feature prominently in Brown's discussion which amplifies many of the points made in the earlier contribution from Openshaw in Chapter 3.,7
785,The analysis points to the need for the development of a fuzzy geodemographics methodology which takes account of the effects of different types of spatial errors.,7
786,Other major research priorities for the future in this applications field are the development of response-modelling techniques to explore the factors affecting consumer choice.,7
787,This is particularly important in a field where many of the demands made by users are highly specialized in nature.,7
788,"In summary, then, as fig. 8.1 shows, many of the issues raised by this review of geographic information handling in the four potential application fields are essentially complementary to those discussed in the part on methodological developments.",7
789,Spatial analysis features particularly prominent on the research agenda relating to natural and technological hazards and geodemographics.,7
790,Questions relating to data integration emerge as being particularly critical environmental monitoring and settlement and infrastructure applications.,7
791,Spatial linkages and questions relating to spatial representation feature prominently in the settlements and infrastructure and geodemographics fields.,7
792,The evaluation of error propagation is a matter of considerable significance in the environmental monitoring and settlements and infrastructure fields.,7
793,"Finally, in all applications fields, the findings of the reviews above suggest that there is a need for improvements in user interfaces of all kinds.",7
794,This is particularly evident in the demand for the development of knowledge-based decision support systems and modelling capabilities.,7
795,Such demands highlight the extent to which geographic information management must be regarded as a means to an end an end in itself when  viewed from the standpoints of the needs of planners and decision-makers.,7
796,The final chapter in this section rounds off the discussion of applications-related research with an examination of organizational issues that need to be taken account of in handling geographic information.,7
797,Campbell presents a conceptual framework for the analysis of the organizational issues involved in the development and implementation of GIS.,7
798,This contribution cuts across many of the questions relating to particular applications that were raised in preceding chapters and draws attention to the dangers of neglecting institutional and personal considerations in practice.,7
799,"All too often, as the experience of many mature applications indicates, technical and data-related matters dominate the system development phase and technically elegant solutions are devised which fail to take enough account of user needs and capabilities.",7
800,Campbell discusses the role of geographic information in organizations and the process of GIS diffusion drawing upon research from a variety of social science disciplines.,7
801,The findings of the analysis are summarized in two sets of research questions for all applications fields.,7
802,In this way she sets out a research agenda for applications-related research which serves a similar function to the spatial analysis research agenda set out by Openshaw at the beginning of Part Two.,7
803,Environmental monitoring and prediction,7
804,David Rhind,7
805,Introduction,7
806,"Monitoring of the state of and the changes in the environment is now universally recognized as being of profound importance to mankind (Tickell 1986, 1989).",7
807,"This awareness is most obviously manifested by the frequent appearance of press reports on ozone depletion, on the greenhouse effect and possible global warming, on nitrate pollution, on deforestation in the Tropics, on decreasing biological diversity and on many other environmentally related topics.",7
808,Usually these reports concentrate on prophecies of a forthcoming Armageddon but many also describe a dire contemporary situation.,7
809,Thus the algal bloom off the Italian Adriatic shore in 1989 is reckoned to have caused the holiday trade and local fisherman losses running into tens if not hundreds of millions of pounds.,7
810,"More globally, the Brundtland Report (WCED 1987) noted that, in the 900 days during which the World Commission was at work,",7
811,1.,7
812,The African drought put the lives of 35 million people at risk and may have killed 1 million of them;,7
813,2.,7
814,The Bhopal accident killed 2000 and injured 200 000 more;,7
815,3.,7
816,The Chernobyl disaster caused environmental damage across Europe;,7
817,4.,7
818,A chemical fire in Switzerland caused toxic materials to be transported by the Rhine as far as the Netherlands;,7
819,5.,7
820,60 million people died of diarrhoeal diseases caused by malnutrition and dirty water.,7
821,"As a consequence of these and other disasters, of rapid and world-wide broadcasting of them and of the concerned action of many individuals, the environment is now ‘moving fast up the political agenda’(Patten 1989).",7
822,"The then Prime Minister also emphasized the political awakening to the environment  in statements : ‘it is possible that with all these enormous changes (population, agricultural, use of fossil fuels) concentrated into such a short period of time, we have unwittingly begun a massive experiment with the system of this planet itself’(Thatcher 1988).",7
823,The political concern is not altruistic.,7
824,"Mrs Thatcher, a recent convert to environmental conservation, clearly held the opinion that environmental problems are not only soluble but that solving them can be shown to be cost-effective:",7
825,"In the past when we identified forms of pollution, we have shown our capacity to act effectively.",7
826,The great London smogs are now only a nightmare of the past.,7
827,We have cut airborne lead by 50 .,7
828,"We are spending £4 billion on cleansing the Mersey Basin alone, and the Thames now has the cleanest metropolitan estuary in the world.",7
829,"this kind of action may cost a lot, I believe it to be money well and necessarily spent because the health of our economy and the health of our environment are totally dependent upon ….",7
830,The Government espouses the concept of sustainable economic development.,7
831,Stable prosperity can be achieved throughout the world provided the environment is nurtured and safeguarded (Thatcher 1988).,7
832,The primary official manifestation of this UK commitment to the environment has been the government's White Paper (HMSO 1990).,7
833,"While criticized by many on the grounds that it had few ‘teeth’ and represented a compromise between the DoE and all other departments (notably those of Agriculture and of Transport), it was a major achievement.",7
834,"Its main sections dealt with the government's approach to the environment (nationally, at the European level and globally), the nature and effects of the greenhouse effect, environmental problems in both rural and urban areas (especially land-use matters), pollution control and enhancing awareness of environmental matters.",7
835,Central to this approach is said to be an emphasis upon guidance from the best available scientific evidence.,7
836,There is also a clear recognition of the need for monitoring and modelling of the state of the natural and man-influenced environment.,7
837,"Though there has been a change of Prime Minister and of the Secretary of State for the Environment since the publication of the White Paper, the environmental cause seems as strong as ever.",7
838,"Thus,of 17 December 1990 reported that a group of 40 of the most senior Civil Servants had met the previous weekend to discuss ‘ways in which the government machine could respond better to national and international problems the threat of global climate change’.",7
839,"Pearce (1989) have argued that the effects of government, commercial and other actions on the environment can and should be assessed on a cost/benefit basis and this seems likely to be the basis on which the UK government will proceed.",7
840,"Given such a lead, it is scarcely surprising that British scientists have sought to demonstrate the practical and financial consequences of environmental events and processes; Table 9.1, illustrates their perception of the importance of global environmental research to the UK domestic economy.",7
841,"If it now seems self-evident that monitoring of the global environment is necessary, indeed is even vital, the prediction of what is likely to happen is almost as important: the 170 000 people in the Maldives are understandably worried about the prospect of global sea-level change since no part of the islands is 2 m above present sea-level!",7
842,"Yet, as we shall see below, the prediction of the activities of natural and man-influenced environmental systems requires an understanding of the interaction of processes that, in many cases, we simply do not yet have.",7
843,"Even monitoring of the present is very imperfect, as witness the order of magnitude variations in estimates now current for deforestation rates.",7
844,"This chapter, then, attempts to review some of the problems in environmental monitoring and prediction, describes some of the relevant scientific and organizational activities and looks ahead to what is likely to happen next.",7
845,The nature of environmental processes,7
846,"Notwithstanding Mrs Thatcher's confidence that we can ‘fix’ environmental problems, the difficulties associated with a task even as apparently simple as monitoring a state variable are considerable.",7
847,"Some of the reasons for this — the difficulty of deciding on appropriate proxy variables and on economical yet non-biasing temporal and spatial sampling frameworks, taking account of the relative importance of aperiodic and rare events as compared to near-continuous processes, processing the vast volumes of data usually involved and organizing the multidisciplinary and (often) multinational researchers involved — are discussed briefly later.",7
848,"Even at this stage, however, it is important to stress that we have a very incomplete understanding of many  processes in the natural environment.",7
849,The next section therefore attempts to summarize what we do know; it is derived chiefly from the Earth System Sciences Committee (ESSC)(1988).,7
850,Temporal and spatial scales of operation,7
851,"Even ignoring the effects of man, earth system processes operate at a variety of spatial and temporal scales (see Fig. 9.1; see also Rosswall 1988).",7
852,"Thus microclimate effects can have major short-term implications for local populations (those brought about by the photochemical smogs of Los Angeles), are often applicable only over areas of a few hectares or less and may operate on a diurnal cycle.",7
853,"In contrast, soil creation (cf. soil degradation) may require hundreds or thousands of years.",7
854,are variations in phenomena .,7
855,The sampling theorem indicates that we must sample these phenomena at a frequency of no less than half their wavelength if we are to avoid bias in measurement.,7
856,"In this chapter, the primary concern is with changes occurring over time spans from minutes to centuries and from spatial wavelengths from about 1 m to about 100 km.",7
857,"It is, however, impossible to separate out processes acting at different scales and over different periods: a single volcanic eruption lasting hours or days sometimes leads to dust and gas being ejected into the atmosphere over a period of months and this in turn may lead to global climatic fluctuations over years or decades.",7
858,"Conversely, a large-scale and long-period phenomenon   the movement of tectonic plates can lead to local stress accumulation and to its release by an earthquake in a few seconds and with highly local effects.",7
859,This therefore has the following consequences:,7
860,1.,7
861,We should know something about the periodicity of the variables we are monitoring if we are not to risk either unnecessarily detailed data collection or aliasing of trends;,7
862,2.,7
863,"Since we know that the periodicity of some variables is longer than the monitoring already carried out by human beings, we must make use of surrogate or proxy variables to extend our range of knowledge (via tree rings, palynology, oxygen isotope ratios from ice cores and geomorphological evidence of environmental change);",7
864,3.,7
865,"Since we are not yet able to predict all the interactions which may be important in a study of environmental problems, collecting potentially useful data those believed central to the problem under study is often wise;",7
866,4.,7
867,We must accept that most data collection exercises will inevitably be a compromise on the grounds of cost and hence less than perfect data sets will be produced;,7
868,5.,7
869,"the use of surrogates, monitoring environmental processes only makes sense over time-scales which are extended by human standards (hence the IGBP (see below) is designed to run for two or three decades);",7
870,6.,7
871,Changes in political priorities may simply result in the need for informed guesswork if suitable data are not available.,7
872,Much attention will be given throughout this chapter to monitoring the environment on a global basis.,7
873,This is not merely its topical nature.,7
874,The main reason is that — though some problems are local and are best studied that way — many others (even involving a limited geographical extent) are best understood within a global framework.,7
875,Thus no meteorologist would attempt to forecast the weather 2 or 3 days ahead without using a mathematical model based on observations from all around the world.,7
876,"Moreover, recent work has shown that much of the heat energy in the seas of the North Atlantic (every square kilometre of which gives off as much energy as a nuclear power station and hence influences our weather) is absorbed from sunlight in the tropical Pacific and is carried by ocean currents through the Drake Passage and up into the Atlantic.",7
877,"Thus, to understand some local and many regional, national and continental and all global environmental events, we need to have a global perspective and hold global databases (Rhind and Mounsey 1989; Mounsey and Tomlinson 1988).",7
878,"In no way, however, does this invalidate the need for microscale studies — , while global data sets may indicate the extent of algal blooms and may causes of them, only detailed study of the algae themselves can provide understanding of why the bloom is occurring.",7
879,The processes themselves,7
880,"A major complication, however, is that the environment can rarely be treated as in a laboratory experiment.",7
881,"Given this, determining the nature of the interactions between the variables becomes a matter of major difficulty.",7
882,"Figure 9.2 is taken from ESSC (1988) and is an attempt to show the interactions between environmental processes, the indicators and implications of change in the state of the environment.",7
883,"In essence, the figure can be summarized as showing processes within the physical climate system and within the biogeochemical one, these systems being interwoven by the global role of water and increasingly affected by human activities.",7
884,The main components of the first system are well known: the atmosphere is its engine and atmospheric circulation is driven by differences in solar heating between the equatorial and polar regions.,7
885,"We are, however, becoming ever more aware of the massive influence of oceans on our climate; research into ocean/atmosphere interactions is now a priority.",7
886,"In ocean dynamics studies, important topics are heat storage, circulation and the role of sea ice.",7
887,"Atmospheric circulation (and, in turn, precipitation and temperature) is also greatly affected by the balance of thermal energy at the land surface, itself affected by the vegetation and terrain characteristics.",7
888,"The biogeochemical system embraces the totality of the movements of the key elements essential to life — carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and others — through what has been described as the total earth system.",7
889,The oceans and their biota play a central role in the carbon and nutrient cycles; global ocean circulation is also critical to the global carbon budget.,7
890,"Trace gases in the atmosphere are key components of the cycles of such elements as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur and the halogens; as is now well known, their concentrations are much influenced by biogenic and anthropogenic activities and the concentrations of such gases as carbon dioxide, ozone, methane, nitrous oxide and the chlorofluoromethanes (CFMs) strongly affect radiative transfer and provide a link with the physical climate system.",7
891,"A particular cause for concern is that the concentrations of the two main CFMs is increasing by about 5 while the equivalent figures for methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide are 1, 0.4 and 0.3 .",7
892,"Finally, the chemistry of the stratosphere is dominated by the photochemical production and catalytic destruction of ozone.",7
893,There are several important ways in which biogeochemical processes can influence climate and hence habitability (except where the latter is maintained at enormous cost).,7
894,"If, , the concentrations of certain trace gases (see above) continue to increase, it has been predicted that the earth's surface temperature will increase by an amount comparable to that since the last major phase of the most recent glaciation (about 18 000 years BP)— though there is some dispute about the magnitude of the likely change.",7
895,"The converse case — the effect of physical climate changes on biogeochemical processes — is also of obvious importance: changes in annual averages and cycles of temperature and precipitation, together with the probabilities of    extreme events prolonged droughts or frosts, are major determinants of terrestrial ecosystem type, in areas largely unaffected by human activity.",7
896,Human-induced changes to the environment have increased rapidly as a consequence of growing population numbers and of numerous developments in technology.,7
897,"fossil fuel combustion, , has led to increased concentrations of sulphate in precipitation (’ acid rain') and many rivers, lakes and estuaries have been greatly affected by phosphates from agricultural, urban or industrial sources.",7
898,"It should be stressed, however, that — while the outlines of human activities are clear — there are still many uncertainties: , we know that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has risen about 9 since 1959.",7
899,"But calculations of the total carbon released by fossil fuel combustion imply that, if all such carbon remained in the atmosphere, the concentration would have increased by twice as much.",7
900,"The absolute difference between the two figures seems to be two different factors: absorption by the oceans and other reductions in carbon stocks in living biota, the latter being strongly affected by human activities since the Industrial Revolution.",7
901,Does God play dice?,7
902,Much environmental prediction is predicated upon a logical positivist or Newtonian deterministic basis.,7
903,"The environmental systems are effectively regarded as machines whose workings can all be discovered, described in differential equation form and whose future activities can thus be predicted in detail if their initial states are known.",7
904,"An argument by many atmospheric physicists, , is that shortcomings in the accuracy of weather prediction over periods of more than a few days largely results from the unsophisticated nature of existing models, the lack of suitable data and inadequate computer power (see Fig. 9.3, derived from Tyler 1989).",7
905,"In   contrast, the advocates of chaos theory (e.g. Stewart 1989) argue that some natural systems are so sensitive to tiny stimuli that even ‘the faint beat of a butterfly's wing could be the ultimate trigger for a hurricane’.",7
906,"In essence, they argue that tiny differences in the initial conditions of many systems can lead to widely different outcomes since the systems exhibit stochastic behaviour within a deterministic framework.",7
907,"If so, there is little chance of making accurate long-term forecasts of these systems.",7
908,"This has been recognized by, among others, ESSC (1988).",7
909,The authors of that report accepted that there is a theoretical limit of 2–3 weeks in explicit prediction of day-to-day fluctuations in weather the influence of small-scale turbulence within the large-scale dynamics; such limits imply that medium and long-term prediction must inevitably be stochastic.,7
910,"To complicate matters still further, however, it seems possible that the components of the earth system may best be predicted deterministically at some spatial and temporal scales but stochastically at others and that the basis of prediction will differ for different components.",7
911,"As an example, atmospheric temperature shows marked day-to-day variability, a strong seasonal cycle with some year-to-year variations, a weak minimum variability for 10–20 year averages and then increased variation again at longer time-scales (ESSC 1988).",7
912,It need hardly be pointed out that coping with such multiple databases on which modelling is to be carried out is not a trivial exercise.,7
913,"Finally, it is perhaps worth concluding this section by emphasizing that there is still much controversy among the scientific community about the magnitude of many of the effects being discussed.",7
914,", the research work of the international groups of scientists, including those involved in the Inter-Governmental Committee and in the UK's Inter-Agency Committee on Global Environmental Change, has progressively reduced the magnitude of the predicted effects of, , global warming.",7
915,"In giving the 1990 Robens Coal Science Lecture at the Royal Institution, Sir John Mason (a former Director of the Meteorological Office) urged caution in interpreting the results of the massive atmospheric and oceanic modelling exercises; as the equilibrium models are refined to take account of the thermal lag in oceans, etc., lower values of predicted changes are likely.",7
916,"Thus, while almost all scientists are — at the time of writing — convinced from the evidence that change in climate is and that regional effects may be much greater than the global average, the magnitude of the latter is now thought likely to be about half of what was predicted only 5 years ago.",7
917,Who is involved and what is going on?,7
918,"If we consider the environment in the broadest sense, much monitoring of it has been in progress for many years and by an enormous diversity of organizations in the UK; these include the DoE, the Forestry Commission, the Nature Conservancy, the Health and Safety Executive, local authorities, the component members of the Natural Environment Research Council (the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology and the British Antarctic Survey), individuals or research groups in academia, the CEGB, the Friends of the Earth, and UK Centre for Economic and Environmental Development (CEED)(1989).",7
919,"The diversity of monitoring organizations seems just as great in other countries; numerous multinational organizations, both quasi-governmental (e.g. the UN Environment Programme (UNEP)) and non-governmental (e.g. the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED)) are also active in the field.",7
920,"Moreover, commercial monitoring of the environment is now also routine, notably to predict crop yields in the main grain-growing areas and hence facilitate the buying of futures.",7
921,The international scientific involvement,7
922,Scientists have both promoted and responded to the increasing interest in the environment.,7
923,"Thus, at the global scale, the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) has endorsed the setting up of the International Geosphere Biosphere Project (IGBP) to ‘describe and understand the interactive physical, chemical and biological processes that regulate the total Earth system, the unique environment it provides for life, the changes that are occurring in that system and the manner by which these changes are influenced by human actions’(Report of Planning Group for IGBP 1986, quoted in IGBP 1988).",7
924,"Priority in the IGBP is intended to be given to those areas which deal with key interactions and significant changes on the time-scales of decades to centuries, that most affect the biosphere, that are most susceptible to human perturbations and those that will most likely lead to a practical, predictive capability for global change.",7
925,This is to be put into operation by concentrating on four themes:,7
926,1.,7
927,Documenting and predicting global change;,7
928,2.,7
929,Observing and improving our understanding of dominant forcing functions;,7
930,3.,7
931,Improving our understanding of interactive phenomena in the total Earth system;,7
932,4.,7
933,Assessing those effects of global change which will be large scale and cause major modifications to both renewable and non-renewable resources.,7
934,"By 1990, IGBP had progressed as far as defining a set of seven core projects (IGBP 1990) addressing these four themes.",7
935,", plans for regional research centres and for the data and information systems for IGBP (known as IGBP-DIS) had been announced.",7
936,The latter are particularly relevant to this chapter.,7
937,"Based in Paris and working under Professor I. Rasool, it is intended to concentrate on managerial and policy aspects of the task in the first 2 years (1990–92) but then to expand considerably thereafter.",7
938,"Tasks  agreed for the IGBP-DIS include making available a ‘directory of data directories’ modelled on NASA's Master Directory, providing data sets for education and training and undertaking a land cover pilot study.",7
939,"Until 1990, remarkably little interaction had taken place between the ‘hard science’ and the social science communities on global monitoring and prediction.",7
940,"It is noteworthy, however, that the Royal Society made a plea for just this type of multidisciplinary work in its submission on greenhouse gases to the House of Lords' Select Committee on Science and Technology (Royal Society 1989: 40).",7
941,"Fortunately, the actions of the world ‘hard science’ community, a parallel effort is now being initiated by social scientists (Fuchs 1989; Jacobson and Price 1990).",7
942,"Currently this is organized and sponsored by the International Social Science Council (ISSC), the UN University and the International Federation of Institutes of Advanced Studies.",7
943,Its objectives are to:,7
944,1.,7
945,Improve scientific understanding and increase awareness of the complex dynamics governing human interaction with the total Earth system;,7
946,2.,7
947,"Study, explore and anticipate social change affecting the global environment;",7
948,3.,7
949,Identify broad social strategies to prevent or mitigate undesirable impacts of global change or to adapt to changes which are unavoidable;,7
950,4.,7
951,Analyse policy options for dealing with global environmental change and promoting the goal of sustainable development.,7
952,"Jacobson and Price (1990) provide a useful summary of the ways in which human factors contribute to, and are affected by, likely global changes; , they stress the importance of the data-handling issues and the role of GIS in coping with some of the problems of data integration and manipulation.",7
953,The ISSC proposed its own work programme in the Human Dimensions of Global Change in late 1990.,7
954,"While these organizations intrinsically have a world-wide membership and are concerned with research into global environmental change, others share the same interest but from a more restricted geographical base.",7
955,A leading example of this is the European Science Foundation which has sponsored research programmes in both the physical and social science aspects of environmental change (ESF 1990).,7
956,Governmental and political involvement,7
957,"The spread of environmental awareness is readily demonstrated: in 1972, 26 countries had environmental and natural resource management agencies whereas, a decade later the number was 144 (WEC 1985).",7
958,"In most countries, the governmental and political concern with the environment has come somewhat later than that of scientists or concerned lay people: the early development of the Green Party in the Federal Republic of Germany  is something of an exception.",7
959,"Such a commitment to the environment is, , both welcome and necessary if resources are to be made available to tackle existing, forthcoming, environmental problems.",7
960,The ‘conversion’ of the UK government has been briefly described earlier; it is manifested in their July 1989 commitment to spend £10m. on climate change research in 1989/90 and the confident request to them from the Advisory Board for the Research Councils (ABRC) for an extra £11m. in 1990 and £13m. in the two succeeding years for additional environmental research.,7
961,"Perhaps the most significant development of all, however, is the increasing role of the European Commission.",7
962,"Their role in bringing environmental impact assessment (EIA) the statute book is well known, but the Commission has now made a proposal (CEC 1989) for the ‘establishment of the European Environment Agency and the European Environment Monitoring and Information Network’.",7
963,"The Commission argues that there is no monitoring of environmental quality and trends on a European scale, nor any guarantee that the results of environmental monitoring will be comparable on a Community-wide basis (a realization brought about through the CORINE programme described later).",7
964,"The objectives of the new agency would be to assist the Community and the Member States to achieve the goals set out in the Treaty of Rome and in successive environmental action programmes; it must also, however, be seen in the context of the European Council's adoption on 2 December 1988 of the Rhodes Declaration on the Environment and the environment chapter in the Single European Act which comes into effect in 1992.",7
965,The detailed specific roles of ‘the System’(comprising both agency and network) are envisaged as:,7
966,1.,7
967,"To provide the Community, the Member States and participating third countries with the objective (sic) information requested for the formulation and implementation of sound and effective environmental policies;",7
968,2.,7
969,", to provide technical, scientific and economic information requested by the Commission in its tasks of identification, preparation and assessment of the implementation and results of environmental action and legislation;",7
970,3.,7
971,To stimulate the development and the application within the agency of techniques of environmental modelling and forecasting that adequate preventative action can be taken at the appropriate time;,7
972,4.,7
973,"To help ensure the harmonization and comparability of environmental data in the Community the integration of European environmental data into international environmental monitoring programmes, those established within the framework of the United Nations and its system of agencies.",7
974,Considerable stress is laid by the Commission on collaboration with national data-gathering agencies and with states the Community's borders.,7
975,It is envisaged that the totality of activities will extend the existing report (CEC 1988) through addressing the issues of the quality and sensitivity of the environment and also the pressures upon it.,7
976,"Priorities for the new agency include study of atmospheric emissions and quality, water resources and quality (including the marine environment), soil erosion and pollution and important land resources, and biotopes and nature conservation.",7
977,"At the time of writing, the proposal has been approved and discussions are in progress on the location of the agency's headquarters.",7
978,It seems certain to have major and growing effects upon environmental monitoring and prediction in Europe and on the policies of component governments.,7
979,"Yet this is the only plan which the Community has the environment: Directorate-General XII (that for Science, Research and Development) has published details of an extensive R&D programme (CEC 1990a) and the Commission as a whole (CEC 1990b) has made public its plans to develop regular official statistics of the environment.",7
980,The private sector,7
981,"Certain aspects of environmental monitoring have long been carried out by the private sector, notably that of crop states on a world-wide basis.",7
982,"Derived from satellite imagery at comparatively low resolution, predicted yields for different crops in different nation states become of commercial value.",7
983,"However, significant resources are also being made available by the private sector where there is no immediate commercial gain: thus IBM UK Ltd has donated £3.5m. of computing equipment to UNEP and IBM is actively supporting other R&D which can be expected to facilitate ‘sustainable development’: IBM Europe, , has invested $16m. in its Bergen scientific centre to make it the focal point for the company's environmental modelling and a centre for information on the environment and sustainable development.",7
984,"On a more modest basis, IBM UK have agreed to fund a pilot global population database being built in Birkbeck College to permit assessment of the impact of environmental change on the world s population.",7
985,"Many other companies, , are supporting environmental work but IBM seems almost to be unique in its corporate commitment to use of high technology for facilitating ‘sustainable development’.",7
986,Some examples of environmental monitoring projects,7
987,The local scale,7
988,"At the local scale, it is usually impossible to neglect the effects of multiple processes operating.",7
989,An example of environmental modelling and prediction  where the interactions between different processes and dynamic feedback is taken into account is given by Haber and Schaller (1988).,7
990,"Their work formed part of one UNESCO Man and Biosphere (MAB) project, carried out in the Berchtesgaden National Park in Bavaria.",7
991,"Following Holling (1978) and Grossman (1983), they conceptualized the man/environment relationship at a series of hierarchical levels:",7
992,1.,7
993,"The lowest, or process, level, is directly and (usually) obviously connected to perceived reality.",7
994,"Thus processes and interrelationships are mostly obvious, simple and linear; data are usually readily available and may be voluminous.",7
995,"This level is readily handled in commercial GIS;,",7
996,2.,7
997,"The intermediate, or dynamic, level is concerned with less frequent and often irregular events, e.g. a temporary lack of water fire, frost or excessive demand from an increasing populace.",7
998,"Characteristically, the data used may be more difficult to obtain and are usually more spatially aggregated; modelling software which permits feedback loops is essential;",7
999,3.,7
1000,"The top, or strategic, level is the most difficult to explore; the external influences are often unpredictable by formal means.",7
1001,Relevant data are therefore difficult to identify and scenario building is one of the few approaches available.,7
1002,The Haber and Schaller approach is to ‘soft-couple’ these different levels and their accompanying approaches using an ecological balance model.,7
1003,Results of running this with different scenarios include ‘time slice’ maps of possible outcomes and of the exchange of material and energy within the study area.,7
1004,"While ultimately qualitative, it seems to offer a method for coping with different types of process and incorporating stochastic and truly random events.",7
1005,The national and continental scale: the CORINE project,7
1006,The CORINE programme represents the product of much activity by the European Commission's Directorate-General (XI) for the Environment.,7
1007,"It originates from an Italian request to the Council of Ministers in 1973 to identify environmentally ‘balanced’ and ‘unbalanced’areas in the Community; the first attempts to do this were unsuccessful and, though by 1981 it was clear that a new approach based on an environmental information system was the most promising one, funding for this was not secured until 1985.",7
1008,"A 4-year experimental programme to ‘collect, co-ordinate and ensure the consistency of information on the state of the environment and natural resources in the European Communities’ was set up and labelled CORINE.",7
1009,"The objectives of CORINE were to be achieved through bringing together existing data holdings in the member states, developing methods for holding, analysing and presenting the data, and encouraging the exchange of data.",7
1010,"A  number of priority areas were identified, including biotopes of importance for nature conservation, acid deposition and its effects on soils and biotopes and the protection of the environment of the Mediterranean region (Briggs and Martin 1988).",7
1011,Many achievements can be claimed by the CORINE project team.,7
1012,"As a result of some 40 sub-projects involving all the Member States (and often several groups within each one), databases of topography, soils, water resources and quality, biotopes, atmospheric emissions, climate, soil erosion and administrative boundaries have been built up for the whole Community and can be interrelated; other data sets (land cover, derived from satellite imagery) have already been compiled for some of the Member States.",7
1013,"Various aspects of the CORINE project have been described in papers by Rhind (1986), Wiggins (1987), Briggs and Martin (1988), Briggs and Mounsey (1989) and CEC (1990c).",7
1014,"For the present purposes, however, the key findings are:",7
1015,1.,7
1016,"Many necessary data sets were unavailable for reasons of administrative inadequacies, confidentiality constraints, cost or non-collection in certain countries;",7
1017,2.,7
1018,"The unavoidable reliance upon existing data sets led to many problems non-harmonization even of commonly used variables, e.g. eight different definitions of potential evapo-transpiration were in use in the Member States and ‘maximum temperature’ at each weather station was defined in four different ways;",7
1019,3.,7
1020,The compilation of a spatially coherent database from mapped information compiled by different organizations at different scales and on different topographic bases (see Rhind and Clark 1988) is often difficult;,7
1021,4.,7
1022,User expectations are often unreasonably high; use of administrative computing systems encourages bureaucrats to believe that environmental data can just as readily be analysed and used to support decisions.,7
1023,"The ‘fuzzy’ nature of much geographically distributed data, the inherent errors in it, the effects of the processing algorithms used and the assumption of known interactions between variables ensures that completely routine use by unskilled users is unlikely to be possible in the foreseeable future;",7
1024,5.,7
1025,More detailed data are required for particular tasks as the role of CORINE grows.,7
1026,The European Commission's proposal for an environment agency (see above) will subsume the CORINE team and databases.,7
1027,The global scale: NASA and GEMS/GRID,7
1028,"Without question, the largest ‘player’ in the global environment arena is NASA.",7
1029,"The organization has initiated many of the schemes which now are  under discussion — the IGBP, , has been strongly influenced by NASA proposals.",7
1030,A summary of current activities and future plans is given in NASA (1988b).,7
1031,"example, current programmes are collecting global data on stratospheric ozone, on sea-surface and sea-ice variables and on the earth's radiation budget.",7
1032,"Approved future programmes include the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, the NASA Scatterometer and the joint NASA/CNES Ocean Topography Experiment.",7
1033,", however, funding has recently been approved for a much more ambitious scheme — the Earth Observing System (EOS).",7
1034,This is conceived not as a set of hardware but as a comprehensive information system focused on the needs identified by the ESSC (see above) and anticipating somewhat those of IGBP.,7
1035,"It will collate data from the two proposed space station polar platforms, one European Space Agency platform, a Japanese one and also from the manned space station.",7
1036,"On this basis, a data flow of no less than 1 terabyte (i.e. 10&sup12; bytes) /day is anticipated by the mid-1990s.",7
1037,A major user of NASA data and skills has been the UN Environment Programme.,7
1038,"formed in the wake of the 1972 Stockholm conference, UNEP soon spawned the Global Environment Monitoring System (GEMS) an international register of potentially toxic chemicals and a global network of sources to locate and provide technical, scientific and management information on the environment.",7
1039,The need for a mechanism to handle the global environmental data was defined in the early 1980s and the Global Resources Information Database (GRID) resulted.,7
1040,"Mooneyhan (1988) has described the progress of the pilot stage of GRID which culminated in approval for a full operational phase; GRID is now involved in integrating, storing and exploiting a variety of global environmental databases, mostly acquired from NASA.",7
1041,"the work being carried out in the UNEP HQ at Nairobi and in the GEMS/GRID site in Geneva, a series of GRID regional nodes are now being set up world-wide, each equipped with the same hardware and software and local subsets of the data.",7
1042,The first of these is in Bangkok and another is to be opened in Latin America.,7
1043,"Moreover, national nodes are also being set up; the recent IBM gift to GRID (see above) has ensured that powerful microcomputers have been installed in many African countries, together with national and continental data sets.",7
1044,Training of unskilled staff to operate this equipment and to exploit the scientific data is now a major role for GRID staff.,7
1045,Technical aspects and problems,7
1046,It follows from much of the above that there are major challenges in use of environmental data.,7
1047,These are best considered by itemizing characteristics of contemporary environmental monitoring and prediction:,7
1048,1.,7
1049,"The use of secondary data, primary data collected by the data analyst;",7
1050,2.,7
1051,"The need, with data on the terrestrial environment, for an inference process to extract useful information from the secondary (and often proxy) data;",7
1052,3.,7
1053,The data volumes collected are often voluminous even by the standards of contemporary computing facilities;,7
1054,4.,7
1055,The analyses carried out are often arcane in detail to all but a small group of ‘high priests’;,7
1056,5.,7
1057,"We have only a limited capacity for checking the accuracy of many environmental monitoring results, of predictions.",7
1058,Some of these characteristics are now addressed in slightly more detail; it will be obvious that such problems merit a paper in themselves.,7
1059,Remote sensing as a data collection process,7
1060,"As the need for more extensive, high-resolution yet consistent and up-to-date data becomes more pressing, increased use of remote sensing seems inevitable.",7
1061,No other data collection methodology obviates the short distance variation in data sets induced by variations in data collection and aggregation methodology typically encountered between adjacent nation states.,7
1062,"The problem is now recognized, especially in Europe, and strenuous efforts are being made to harmonise the data sets (e.g. through the use of standard classifications, that for land use produced by the Conference of European Statisticians in 1989).",7
1063,", however, ground-collected environmental data are far less than ideal.",7
1064,"Recognizing this, NASA (1988a) concluded that forthcoming global science projects would need land surface altitude data at three resolutions: 1 km resolution in XY and 10–100 m resolution in Z on a global basis, 100 m XY resolution and 1–10 m resolution in Z for regional databases and 10 m XY resolution and 0.1–1 m in Z for local studies.",7
1065,They argued that existing maps and digitized files from them are unable to meet these needs at global or regional scale and only remote sensing could help in the short term: the availability of stereometric data from the French SPOT satellite has already led to proposals for automated creation of global digital elevation models with a spatial (XY) resolution of about 30 m (Muller 1989).,7
1066,"For many terrestrial purposes, however, a substantial inference process must take place to convert the radiometric measurements into useful information (in contrast, more direct measurements of sea state, etc. are possible).",7
1067,"The value of this information is inherently dependent upon the quality of the inference process and that in turn depends upon the complexity of the scene, the spatial, temporal and spectral resolution of the sensors and the particular algorithms used.",7
1068,"Thus far, , accuracies of land cover (what is often needed, i.e. land use) determined from Landsat and SPOT imagery for the UK have rarely been higher than 70 unless trivial classifications (e.g. built/unbuilt land) have been used.",7
1069,"One  solution to this is to ‘densify’ the ground control and another is to use contextually based classifiers the traditional, spectrally based ones.",7
1070,"But the ground conditions in some parts of Europe make good results extremely difficult to obtain: some areas of Portugal, , have field sizes of only a few metres and exhibit multi-level and multi-seasonal cropping.",7
1071,A further difficulty is the cost of the data its anticipated benefits.,7
1072,Relatively few cost/benefit studies have yet been carried out except in such areas as crop prediction and ocean navigation (where they are generally shown to be highly advantageous in saving someone else's money).,7
1073,It may be that a study commissioned from contractors by the British National Space Centre will provide useful evidence on the cash value of remote sensing; it is particularly timely the appointment of Professor Pearce (see above) as the adviser to the UK Secretary of State for the Environment.,7
1074,Other work on assessment of costs and benefits of such data have been carried out for the French government by Professor Didier (1990).,7
1075,"Finally, since data are often costly to acquire, it follows that summaries of them e.g. report (CEC 1988) and the of the UN EP (GEMS MARC 1989) are of considerable value.",7
1076,"Equally, the ‘signposting’ role now being adopted by UNEP's GRID project — which is expected to offer on-line access to a catalogue of environmental data sets and details of the responsible agencies in 1991 — is to be welcomed.",7
1077,The data problem and partial solutions,7
1078,The lack of harmonization of definitions and methods of collection of environmental data have already been outlined above.,7
1079,"In the European Community of 12 nation states, , no eight procedures for calculating potential evapo-transpiration have been in use!",7
1080,"The need for harmonization is obvious and, in this respect, must follow from the successful pioneering achievements of EUROSTAT in harmonizing the definitions in trade, demographic and other ‘social science’ statistics (see CEC 1990b).",7
1081,An additional and severe problem is that the volumes of data which are already collected are huge by the standards of only a decade ago.,7
1082,"By 1995/96, they will be very much greater, notably from the EOS programme.",7
1083,NASA has announced plans to collect 1 terabyte (10&sup12; bytes) /day.,7
1084,"Since remote sensing data sets (especially those terrestrial areas of the globe) typically need much pre-processing to calibrate, transform and then perform an inference process and hence convert measurements of the radiation reflected or emitted by small areas of ground into useful (e.g. land cover) data, the processing power required is going to be formidable.",7
1085,"Other, non-remote-sensing data sets are smaller in volume but  more complex in structure and in their characteristics.",7
1086,To hold all of the 1/50 000 scale topographic map coverage alone for the European Community would probably require about 3 terabytes of storage.,7
1087,"Parenthetically, the form in which the data may be held can affect dramatically the scale of the problem faced.",7
1088,"It would be technically possible, , to hold in less than 1 terabyte detailed information for every individual in the world, akin to that collected about everyone in the UK through the Census of Population.",7
1089,"In practice, legislation generally forbids such data being held thus and distributed in anything area aggregate form; the cross-tabulations commonly employed (e.g. to give tables of population numbers broken down by age and sex) often result in a great multiplication of the data volumes.",7
1090,"This all presents major problems of data storage, handling (especially for global data sets), display and dissemination.",7
1091,"Fortunately, technical developments have ensured that the increase in computing power per unit cost has been growing at about an order of magnitude every 6 years over the last three decades.",7
1092,"Indeed, this may grossly under-represent the present situation: the rapid spread of UNIX-based systems seems to facilitate competition and, at the time of writing, performance of workstations per unit cost seems to be increasing at about 50 .",7
1093,"Moreover, the advent of low-cost, high-density-storage devices like CD-ROMs may well make substantial data sets available even to those with modest computing power: a CD-ROM, , can hold about 600 megabytes (i.e. 10&sup6; bytes), can be reproduced currently for about £1 and read on a device costing about £400.",7
1094,"Yet, despite such revolutionary changes in technology, novel solutions will still be required to make effective use of the new data sets.",7
1095,One such solution is Goodchild and Yang's (1989) scheme for a hierarchical spatial data structure to handle data for the spherical earth.,7
1096,A particular problem is that little or no quantitative regard has been paid until recently to the effects of quality variation in environmental data.,7
1097,The literature of the last few years is thronged with papers proposing that these must be taken into account — but with few realistic proposals on how this is to be achieved.,7
1098,Goodchild (1988) has made perhaps the best summary of the problem and possible solutions to date.,7
1099,"Finally, relatively little emphasis has been given to the management of data as a corporate resource, available to a wide community: many environmental data are collected on a project-by-project basis and ‘lost’ once the urgency of the initial research is over.",7
1100,"However, the 1990 report of the Data and Facilities Working Group of the UK Inter-Agency Committee on Global Environmental Change argued strongly that planning for the dissemination and maintenance of such data was a vital role.",7
1101,It also noted that ownership of and access to environmental data was a policy matter of the greatest importance; this may be more difficult in ‘within country’ data than with global data since the latter are often already the subject of international exchange agreements at zero cost.,7
1102,Global environmental research and the social sciences,7
1103,"Thus far, the emphasis has been very much on the natural science aspects of environmental monitoring and prediction.",7
1104,That is unremarkable since the anticipation of such problems and assessments of some of their causes and magnitudes can only be made by environmental scientists.,7
1105,"Yet the consequences of any significant changes are a matter of the utmost concern to planners and to politicians at all levels, the quantification of the costs and benefits of alternative policy strategies is very much a matter for economists, and the adaptation of societies to massive change is a particular interest to sociologists and others.",7
1106,"For geographers — who span the conventional (and now archaic) dichotomy between the natural and the environmental sciences — all of these aspects need to be woven together to anticipate the likely spatial patterns of the effects of massive change, the redistributions in trade, health and wealth which they will bring about and the ‘knock on’ effects these consequences themselves will have on society and the environment.",7
1107,"For social scientists, then, environmental monitoring and prediction are a matter of considerable significance, especially as ‘globalization’ of markets and economies proceeds.",7
1108,The Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) commissioned two reports on global environmental change to guide or inform the allocation of research funding.,7
1109,These reports (Pearce 1990; Turner 1990) may be taken as informed views from the economists in the UK social science community on the social science aspects of global environmental change.,7
1110,"Pearce (1990), , presented an economist's views of the high-priority topics for research as follows:",7
1111,1.,7
1112,"The theory and practice of international agreements, viewed in a game theory context;",7
1113,2.,7
1114,"The theory of optimal behaviour under scientific uncertainty;,",7
1115,3.,7
1116,"Cost-benefit frameworks, especially for dealing with man-induced climatic effects;",7

1127,9.,7
1128,National and global energy options given the greenhouse effect;,7
1129,10.,7
1130,Trade and global change.,7
1131,Turner (1990) argued that the priorities are as follows:,7
1132,1.,7
1133,The socio-economic consequences of sea-level rise;,7
1134,2.,7
1135,Techniques for the valuation of environmental resources and effects;,7

1140,5.,7
1141,Understanding of how environmental issues and technical change interact;,7
1142,6.,7
1143,The interrelationship between environmental ethics and economics.,7
1144,"There is, then, no shortage of social science research which is claimed to be necessary if we are to cope with environmental change.",7
1145,Some of it is being carried out: in March 1991 ESRC announced a £6m programme of research on Global Environmental Change.,7
1146,"However, perhaps most critical of all in the early stages is social science practice research.",7
1147,"In the USA , there needs to be an improvement in scientists' understandings of how to influence the allocation of funding for remedial measures or for further research (see Kitsos and Ashe 1989).",7
1148,"All too often, it seems that the coupling of an imperfect scientific understanding to policy-making is tenuous (see Table 9.2).",7
1149,"Fortunately, considerable high-quality work has already begun on the legal, political and institutional aspects of global environmental change (see, , Nitze 1990).",7
1150,What next?,7
1151,The contents of this chapter have scarcely touched upon such important environmental research as the World Ocean Climate Experiment or the World Climate Research Programme.,7
1152,Nor has there been any discussion of the growing requirement in the UK (as elsewhere) to carry out an environmental impact assessment for all major developments.,7
1153,The consequences for some nations or subgroups in a population of being without access to environmental data or the tools for analysing them while others have such access are potentially profound — as the European Commission has recognized in issuing  a directive on public access to environmental data (CEC 1990d)— yet space limitations have also precluded their discussion.,7
1154,"Despite these shortcomings dictated by the space available, what has been said should be sufficient to illustrate the enormous and diverse scope of environmental monitoring and prediction.",7
1155,Such is its diversity that measuring the total expenditure on it seems quite impossible and the number of ‘actors’ already involved is vast.,7
1156,"What is clear, however, is that monitoring is rarely a simple exercise, that the time-scales of the sponsors of monitoring and environmental research are rarely long term though most science is inevitably of this nature and that the increasingly multinational nature of such work necessitates a degree of management not always present in local or nationally based schemes.",7
1157,"In these circumstances, it is scarcely surprising that there is evidence of international and interdisciplinary dispute, as Terney (1989) has chronicled IGBP.",7
1158,"Moreover, as Newby (1990) has pointed out, the complexities of environmental research have created a new kind of relationship between research and policy: ‘in the past,…the relationship was predicated on the belief that science provided decision-makers with objective ‘hard’ facts on which to base their soft, value-ridden policies….",7
1159,"But now we find scientists delivering only ‘soft’, uncertain ‘facts’ to decision-makers facing ‘hard’decisions.’",7
1160,"Yet, all of this causes great uncertainty among scientists, it is still a reasonable prediction that a decade ahead will see both environmental monitoring and prediction treated as an everyday need and activity in major organizations.",7
1161,We shall also see the existence of binding requirements upon national governments — certainly in the European Community — to collect basic environmental indicators in a harmonized form (CEC 1990b).,7
1162,"More than that, it seems highly likely that the social science aspects of environmental problems will underpin the actions of governments and international agencies.",7
1163,"Perhaps the single most important conclusion to be drawn from this review is that the monitoring, modelling and management of the global environment are tasks which uniquely require the integration of skills and techniques from many disciplines.",7
1164,Building such research teams is essential.,7
1165,"Underlying it all, however, is one obvious fact: that the gathering and analysis of geographically distributed environmental data form the necessary starting-point for ensuring the success of our future on earth.",7

1169,Managing natural and technological hazards,7
1170,Anthony C. Gatrell and Peter Vincent,7
1171,Introduction,7
1172,"Few areas of the application of GIS technology can be as socially significant, or environmentally relevant, as the management of emergencies and disasters natural and technological hazards.",7
1173,"Whether attempting to construct a database of resources for use in planning responses to nuclear emergencies, developing optimal routes for scheduling the safe transport of hazardous substances, or monitoring the health implications of a disaster, GIS can assist in identifying possibilities and formulating solutions.",7
1174,The 1990s have been declared the .,7
1175,"Let us hope that G1S can, in some small way, help mitigate the suffering and hardship felt by all those afflicted by the effects of hazards which, as we have learnt with bitter recent experience in the UK, can occur in an untimely fashion in the most improbable of places.",7
1176,"Research on hazards is multidisciplinary and straddles the social, environmental and mathematical sciences.",7
1177,"If, , we wish to model the dispersal of a plume of toxic gas resulting from a chemical explosion, assess its possible impact on human health and evaluate likely evacuation scenarios of the population at risk we would require, , a knowledge of atmospheric dispersion models, epidemiology and population distribution.",7
1178,Some researchers suggest that hazards (and emergencies that might result) can be regarded as either natural or technological.,7
1179,"We shall elaborate on this simple division below but suggest here that the wealth of literature on the former (see, , Burton 1978 and Perry 1981) has yet to be matched by a similar volume of work on the latter.",7
1180,There are signs that this imbalance is being rectified (Zeigler 1983).,7
1181,"Hazard research, like few other GIS application areas, is not only stretching the present technology to its limits but is a quite remarkable focus of international effort into several important research-related areas expert systems and simulation studies.",7
1182,"In this sense the scene is clearly one of hazard problems looking for improved GIS for GIS looking for good problems, as is all too often the case.",7
1183,Hazard research,7
1184,What are hazards?,7
1185,"Formally, a hazard can be defined as: ‘a physical situation with a potential for human injury, damage to property, damage to the environment, or some combination of these’(Health and Safety Executive 1989: 30).",7
1186,"A hazard is a threat which, given a set of circumstances, may become translated into a realized event.",7
1187,"What we choose to call this event depends upon factors its magnitude: we speak of accidents, emergencies, disasters and catastrophes, each of which carries connotations concerning the scale of the event and each of which will have a set of human and/or environmental consequences.",7
1188,"On 30 March 1956 one of the most powerful volcanic disturbances this century, the Bezymianny eruption, occurred.",7
1189,Few people noticed the event as it took place in an uninhabited part of Kamchatcka and caused no known casualties.,7
1190,"In contrast, the extrusion of a small volume of lava from a secondary cone on the slopes of Tristan da Cunha became the focus of global interest when, during October 1961, the island's lobster processing plant was smothered and the 300 people of the island's only settlement were evacuated to the UK.",7
1191,These two contrasting events emphasize the central fact that even natural hazards are not defined solely by the characteristics of the event but by the interaction of those events with the human occupation of the threatened area.,7
1192,"As noted above, the simple division of hazards is between those which are natural and those which are technological or human-induced.",7
1193,Each of these may be further subdivided and the typology shown in Fig. 10.1 draws upon the classic work of Burton and Kates (1964) in separating geophysical from biological hazards and Zeigler (1983) in distinguishing public (or what we might call societal) hazards from private (individual) ones.,7
1194,The further subdivision of natural hazards is self-explanatory as is that of individual technological hazards.,7
1195,"Zeigler divides the public hazards into those which result from the production of raw materials and manufactured goods, those which originate in transport and transmission and those which threaten the public in their role as consumers.",7
1196,"The United Nations Disaster Relief Organization (UNDRO) has produced a classification of disasters, derived on the basis of case data (Table 10.1).",7
1197,"UNDRO recognizes three basic types of disaster: accidents, natural events, and other disasters.",7
1198,The differentiation of accidents from other types is useful in the context of emergency planning and is not so clearly conveyed by other     hazard typologies.,7
1199,"However, the temptation in all classification exercises is to produce partitional schemes and this should really be resisted here.",7
1200,"It is more useful (Johnson 1983) to adopt a non-partitional scheme (fig. 10.1) that recognizes, , food poisoning as both a personal and consumer hazard, or lead pollution (e.g. from car exhausts) as both a meteorological event and technological hazard (both public and private).",7
1201,"An air crash (as at Lockerbie) affects an entire community directly, being an occupational hazard and risk to the individual traveller.",7
1202,Hillslope failure (as   at Aberfan in South Wales in 1966) is a geomorphic hazard but may arise raw material extraction.,7
1203,Dutch elm disease is a floral hazard but is exacerbated by the transport of infected logs.,7
1204,Hohensemer (1983) make the important point that hazards are multidimensional in nature and suggest 12 dimensions along which any hazard may be scored (see Table 10.2).,7
1205,"These factors will, , be important in deciding on the role that GIS can play in hazard monitoring and emergency planning.",7
1206,", some events will persist briefly, have immediate consequences, minor transgenerational effects and have little or no potential for non-human mortality (an air crash is an example).",7
1207,"Others, a chemical explosion involving the release of a toxic gas, may persist for a week or more, have delayed consequences, may affect a future generation if the toxic chemical is mutagenic and may have a significant impact on plant and animal populations.",7
1208,There may be more scope for a GIS approach in the latter than in the former situations.,7
1209,"The Hohensemer scheme is not, however, beyond criticism.",7
1210,", can hazards really be thought of as having any intentionality?",7
1211,Industrial hazards and risk assessment,7
1212,Once hazards have been identified there may follow efforts to assess the hazard risk.,7
1213,By ‘risk’ we understand ‘the likelihood of a specified undesired event occurring within a specified period or in specified circumstances’(Health and Safety Executive 1989: 30).,7
1214,"It may, , be easier to quantify risk for natural hazards historical records and statistical estimation of recurrence intervals.",7
1215,"Technological hazards are more unpredictable and may be extremely rare, it becomes difficult to use probability concepts to quantify risk, especially those which rely on notions of relative frequency.",7
1216,"The identification of chemical hazards requires that the locations of sites be known, together with the dangerous substances stored or processed  there.",7
1217,In the UK (see Petts 1988 for a splendid overview) the Health and Safety Executive must be notified of sites where hazardous substances threshold limits are handled.,7
1218,"Such substances and thresholds include, , 25 tonnes of flammable liquid petroleum gas and the explosive sodium chlorate, and 10 tonnes of toxic chlorine gas.",7
1219,"Some 1600 installations are notifiable, thousands of kilometres of pipelines (mostly high-pressure natural gas transmission lines).",7
1220,"Following a number of major accidents involving industrial activities (including those at Flixborough, Humberside in 1974; Beek, the Netherlands in 1975; and Seveso and Manfredonia in Italy in 1976), the EC issued a Directive on Major Accident Hazards.",7
1221,"The Directive, which is commonly referred to as the ‘Seveso’ Directive, was issued in June 1982 and in the UK its requirements were embodied in the Control of Major Accident Hazard (CIMAH) Regulations (1984).",7
1222,"Among other things, these regulations require operators of hazardous installations to draw up on-site and off-site emergency plans and to give information to members of the public who live or work near such installations (Houston 1987).",7
1223,There are presently about 300 CIMAH sites.,7
1224,"However, many potentially hazardous chemical installations are not covered by such regulations.",7
1225,"Clearly, a plant which stores 1 tonne less than is required for notification slips through the net, while large numbers of handling sites (warehouses, ) are not covered.",7
1226,"The regulations have obvious implications for G1S work, as illustrated below.",7
1227,"In Halton Borough, Cheshire, , there are 13 notifiable installations, with over 20 000 people living within the defined ‘consultation zones’(Petts 1988).",7
1228,It is also relevant to point out here the work of the Health and Safety Executive in developing techniques for quantitative risk assessment (Health and Safety Executive 1989).,7
1229,"Such techniques include the use of a ‘risk assessment tool’(RISKAT), inputs to which include data on wind direction and speed; the output of which is a map of calculated risk contours.",7
1230,In societal risk assessment ‘it is also necessary to input data on the distribution of population around the installation.,7
1231,"This can be a difficult and time-consuming process, and inevitably some simplifying assumptions are needed’(Health and Safety Executive 1989: 17).",7
1232,"Again, the G1S implications are clear and are discussed below.",7
1233,Hazardous waste disposal,7
1234,The disposal of both nuclear and non-nuclear wastes has proved to be of major public concern in recent years.,7
1235,"The rather clumsy handling by NIREX of the search for sites to store low- and intermediate-level wastes, together with very recent worries about the import of toxic wastes polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), are but two examples of such concern in the UK.",7
1236,"However, while the former has been given considerable attention by geographers (summarized by Openshaw 1989) there has been relatively little such work in the UK on the disposal of non-nuclear wastes.",7
1237,"This  contrasts with the situation in the USA (Greenberg and Anderson 1984), where the clean-up of abandoned sites is a priority.",7
1238,"Certainly, the volume of waste generated in the UK non-nuclear hazardous industrial wastes should be high on the environmental agenda; while less than 1 million tonnes of all nuclear wastes were generated in 1985–86, 10 times that amount were generated of hazardous wastes (Openshaw 1989: 13).",7
1239,Attention should be drawn to the three Annual Reports of the Hazardous Waste Inspectorate (now merged with other branches of the DoE to form Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution).,7
1240,"These contain some valuable material on disposal practices, and volumes of waste generated and disposed of by each waste regulation authority (WRA)— counties in England, districts in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.",7
1241,Each WRA is required to produce a waste disposal plan and these are starting to appear.,7
1242,"They too contain useful material on, , the locations of sites, though individual site licences must be consulted for details of what each is permitted to take in the way of hazardous wastes.",7
1243,"What is not known is information on the locations of former sites, at which quite toxic materials may have been dumped, though recent work by Egger (1989) in Austria has mapped a vast number of such sites.",7
1244,"It is these, existing, licensed sites which should be a focus of research activity, particularly when examining possible links to ill health.",7
1245,"We simply do not have enough evidence yet to back up the claim that ‘people are almost certainly ill, dead, or dying these sloppy waste disposal activities’(Openshaw 1989: 12).",7
1246,"Research is in progress, however, to assess possible health effects of poor incineration (Diggle 1990).",7
1247,"Particular attention should be focused on hospital incinerators, since these have been Crown immunity for many years and most are technically ill-equipped to burn at sufficiently high temperatures for adequate disposal of wastes (Gatrell and Lovett 1991).",7
1248,"We need to produce an inventory of all such sites, together with a publicly available, comprehensive database on all sites accepting hazardous industrial wastes.",7
1249,Emergency planning,7
1250,It is convenient to retain the nuclear/non-nuclear distinction when discussing the background to emergency planning.,7
1251,Nuclear emergency planning in the UK has been reviewed by Matthews and Pepper (1981).,7
1252,Nuclear power stations must prepare a plan and submit this to the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate and Health and Safety Executive for approval.,7
1253,Evacuation plans are required to cover an area within a distance of 2.4 km; these detail the roles to be played by the emergency services.,7
1254,"The very narrow emergency planning zones contrast with those in the USA (Collins 1981), where planning is required 16 km from the site to cover exposure to radiation plumes.",7
1255,"Local authorities in the UK that have declared themselves ‘nuclear-free’ have been highly critical of British planning, calling for an extension of emergency zones to 24 km.",7
1256,Zeigler (1983) should be consulted for material  relating to evacuation behaviour in the wake of the incident at Three Mile Island.,7
1257,"In the UK little work of any description seems to have been done on human behaviour in the aftermath of releases of hazardous substances, nor is much available on public attitudes to emergency planning.",7
1258,"Indeed, no major studies of evacuation hazards have been undertaken in recent times and this is a widely recognized deficiency which no research funding body seems willing to rectify.",7
1259,"In the USA on the other hand, a good deal of useful research in these areas has been undertaken.",7
1260,"This research is brought together in very useful reports produced by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tennessee (Sorenson 1987; Vogt and Sorenson 1987) and the Disaster Research Centre, University of Delaware.",7
1261,"Perry (1985) has written an interesting book on emergency planning and evacuation, covering both natural and technological hazards.",7
1262,"For him, comprehensive emergency planning and management involve: prevention, protection, response and restoration.",7
1263,"By prevention we understand the elimination or reduction in risk, perhaps by adequate zoning or safe routeing of shipments, .",7
1264,Included in protection are methods for detecting likely hazard events and in warning those likely to be affected.,7
1265,"Response includes search and rescue (including the need to cope with secondary threats contamination of water supplies after an explosion, or fire following an earthquake).",7
1266,"As Perry and others have noted, relatively few resources are devoted to the first two aspects, the bulk going to response and restoration (rebuilding).",7
1267,It should be clear from this brief description that these issues are inherently geographical.,7
1268,In one of the few studies of evacuation behaviour after a non-nuclear hazard event Liverman and Wilson (1981) give weight to this argument.,7
1269,"In 1979 a train carrying chlorine, liquid petroleum, toluene and propane was derailed in Mississauga, Ontario, causing a series of explosions.",7
1270,"This led to the evacuation of 250 000 people which, although staggered over several days, led to great pressure on transport arteries.",7
1271,"An important finding was that many relied on their own transport and went to stay with friends and relatives some distance away, relying on the 19 official evacuation reception centres.",7
1272,"Despite this, the evacuation was successful, partly because the accident occurred at a weekend and the immediately affected area was sparsely populated.",7
1273,", the police were well prepared, stimulated largely by implementing a plan designed more to cope with an emergency at the nearby Toronto International Airport than for the event in question.",7
1274,"It is not without interest to note that in the USA there is a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), established in 1978, charged with dealing with all types of emergency planning and management.",7
1275,"In the UK there is no equivalent, though the spate of disasters in the past 4 years (involving over 1000 lives lost) has led to several calls for such a national body to be established.",7
1276,Natural hazards,7
1277,In this short space it is not possible to go into any depth on the nature of particular natural hazards but only to highlight those aspects relevant to GIS.,7
1278,"Needless to say, the study of natural hazards is important, a statement brought into sharp focus by the fact that natural hazards account for 4 of total deaths in the world each year (Mitchell, 1974).",7
1279,"In 1970, , 200 000 people died in the cyclone and flooding of Bangladesh and in 1979 the hurricanes David and Frederick caused $3bn damage in the USA.",7
1280,Shah (1983) made a comprehensive investigation of natural disaster reports for the period 1974–80 and concluded that both disaster frequency and magnitude (measured lives lost) are increasing.,7
1281,"High death tolls are still a characteristic of less developed, low-income countries.",7
1282,"Surprisingly, fog is the third most important hazard in Europe after floods and volcanoes.",7
1283,Research on natural hazards has a long tradition in geography going back more than half a century.,7
1284,Much of the impetus for such research arose in the USA from observations on river basin management and the need to reduce flood damage.,7
1285,The vast majority of natural hazards studies have ignored the physical nature of the events and have concentrated on behavioural issues the perception and estimation of hazards.,7
1286,"This emphasis is partly the background of the researchers involved (many are human geographers and sociologists) and partly because it is only really since the Second World War that major hazards have been monitored systematically, culminating, , in the last decade or so in the use of satellite technology.",7
1287,"Brief reference to two examples of natural hazards may illustrate the potential relevance of a GIS approach, applications of which are considered below.",7
1288,Jones (1989) have examined the distribution of some 8500 landslides in the UK.,7
1289,Their maps show clearly an increased propensity for landsliding in the north and west of the UK.,7
1290,"More to the point, however, is the fact that this distribution can be modelled slopes, rainfall, rock types .",7
1291,In other words the actual hazard distribution can be understood and areas at risk identified.,7
1292,"The potential benefits to insurance companies, engineers and planners are clear.",7
1293,"Second, a well-known winter hazard in the UK, with marked spatial localization, is fog.",7
1294,Predictive models of its distribution have clear implications for road and air safety.,7
1295,"Perry (1981) describes a fog potential index that is a function of local topography, environmental features affecting fog formation and distance from standing water bodies.",7
1296,"Reliance is currently placed on a network of monitoring stations, often sparsely located and frequently outside fog-prone areas; GIS could implement a predictive model based on digitized map features and indeed the model could also be used in site allocation studies for airports and the like.",7
1297,The majority of natural hazard research has focused on single hazards but any area may be prone to one hazard type.,7
1298,This idea led Hewitt and Burton (1971) to develop the concept of ‘all-hazards-at-a-place’.,7
1299,To achieve this they concentrated on the whole spectrum of damaging events in an area and explored their aggregate impact.,7
1300,The implications for GIS in the development of ‘hazardousness’ indices are obvious and if time-series data are available there is the potential to produce a variety of probability maps.,7
1301,The collection of historical data on natural hazards is important since it is clear that their spatial pattern varies through time.,7
1302,Many areas that appear to be hazard-free on current maps may merely by passing through a temporary period of quiescence.,7
1303,This is perhaps best illustrated earthquakes.,7
1304,", in 1692, the whole of southern England was affected by an earthquake whose epicentre was located in what is now Belgium; a good deal of minor structural damage was inflicted (Morse 1983).",7
1305,Presumably the builders of the Channel Tunnel are aware of this?,7
1306,Environmental epidemiology,7
1307,"This is, , a vast subject area, embracing the impact of the natural and technological environments on human health.",7
1308,"It covers, , the associations between water and air pollution and ill health, links between geological and pedological environments and ill health, associations between specific technological hazards (e.g. high-voltage power lines) and possible health effects.",7
1309,"We can only consider a small fraction of this work here; little consideration is given to occupational environments, .",7
1310,"In the UK such research is widespread though there are specialist environmental epidemiology research institutes at Southampton and Cardiff (funded by the Medical Research Council), and others at the University of Surrey (Robens Institute) and at the London School for Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.",7
1311,"The latter houses the Small Area Health Statistics Research Unit (SAHSRU), which has a specific remit to conduct research into morbidity and mortality at local scales (Elliot 1988).",7
1312,The SAHSRU liaises closely with OPCS.,7
1313,The kinds of databases used by these groups are discussed below.,7
1314,Greenberg (1983) and a collection of papers in Greenberg (1987) review some of the literature on environmental epidemiology.,7
1315,It seems worth stating at the outset that there are two ways geographical research in this general area can proceed.,7
1316,"One is to collect morbidity and mortality data (usually the latter is more widely available, though the former more useful) and to examine spatial distributions for clustering.",7
1317,This has itself generated a substantial literature (see the papers in Elliot 1988 for an overview) and is nowhere better exemplified than in Openshaw's geographical analysis machine (see Ch. 2).,7
1318,We then search retrospectively for evidence of possible environmental associations.,7
1319,An alternative approach is to begin by hypothesizing an environmental determinant of ill health and to collect data to test an explicit hypothesis.,7
1320,If an association is suggested then we would want to collect data in other areas to assess the hypothesis further.,7
1321,", these  two approaches are not clear-cut in practice; in many cases the hypotheses of interest will have themselves been generated by inductive mapping.",7
1322,One example of an hypothesis which has been given serious attention in recent years is the possible link between electromagnetic fields generated by high-voltage power lines or supply cables and ill health.,7
1323,"Some work (Perry 1981) suggested associations with mental illness and suicide, while others (e.g. Wertheimer and Leeper 1982) have examined links to various cancers, including leukaemias.",7
1324,A good bibliography is provided in Perry and Pearl (1988).,7
1325,"The Central Electricity Generating Board (now privatized and split into two companies) is funding a large-scale, 2-year project to assess links to childhood cancer, while another recently announced study aims to look at links to sudden infant death.",7
1326,"One obvious problem, with implications for any GIS input, is that the effects are highly localized, with little measurable field effect more than a few dozen metres the route centre-lines.",7
1327,Accuracy of digital data collection (either of the power lines or residential locations) is paramount.,7
1328,There seems to be a growing interest in examining associations between ill health and the geological environment.,7
1329,"GIS work in this field (e.g. Matthews 1989) is reviewed later, but we note here the work of the applied geochemistry group at Imperial College (responsible for a series of atlases on regional geochemistry) and the existence of a Society for Environmental Geochemistry and Health.",7
1330,One area of recent debate concerns radon gas and its links to lung cancer.,7
1331,"This is taken very seriously in the USA, where the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 10 000–20 000 deaths from lung cancer each year are radon gas exposure.",7
1332,Estimates from Scandinavia suggest that 10–30 of such deaths are caused by exposure to radon (Richardson 1988: 270–81).,7
1333,The gas is trapped in well-insulated houses and is produced by the decay of uranium in rocks and soil; thus it has been measured at high concentrations in parts of Cornwall and Devon.,7
1334,"There are great difficulties in assessing health effects, however, since exposure varies greatly from house to house within small neighbourhoods.",7
1335,Carefully designed case-control studies are therefore required to measure the separate effect of radon exposure after controlling for smoking behaviour and other risk factors.,7
1336,Other health concerns which might merit attention by those involved in the Regional Research Laboratory (RRL) initiative include air and water pollution.,7
1337,"The debate about lead pollution from vehicle exhaust emissions is well known; less publicity has been given to PAHs (polychlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons), a  product of combustion processes and known to be carcinogenic (Lioy and Daisey 1987).",7
1338,Research at the North West Regional Research Laboratory (NWRRL) aims to create buffers around busy roads and junctions and to use data from the Cancer Registry to examine possible links between proximity to such sources of pollution and prevalence of lung cancer.,7
1339,"Those with an interest in health and air pollution should note the availability of a very detailed database from the Warren Springs Laboratory, containing details of smoke and sulphur dioxide emissions at a large number of sites in the UK.",7
1340,"The possible link between nitrates in water and stomach cancer is  the subject of much debate (Beresford 1985), as is the association between aluminium content and Alzheimer's disease.",7
1341,"The problems of assessing such links are, , huge, but there is scope for a contribution.",7
1342,The role of GIS in hazard management scenarios — examples,7
1343,"As we have already implied, GIS has a role to play in all aspects of hazard research, from hazard monitoring, risk assessment and emergency planning to coping with an event and evaluating its consequences.",7
1344,"The examples described below illustrate all these, though there do not appear to be many instances of disasters in the management of which GIS has played a significant part.",7
1345,"Technological hazards, emergency planning and GIS",7
1346,A considerable amount of research has been undertaken to apply GIS methods to evacuation scenarios around hazardous sites.,7
1347,Much of this research has concentrated on network analysis of the road system.,7
1348,"Reference was made above to so-called CIMAH sites, major hazardous installations for which on-site and off-site emergency plans must be prepared.",7
1349,"Early research at the NWRRL focused on developing a GIS for use by the police and county emergency planning officers in Cumbria that would aid in the management of a possible explosion at a chemical factory in Whitehaven, west Cumbria (Vincent 1988; Dunn 1989).",7
1350,The police required a portable system that could be implemented on an IBM-compatible microcomputer.,7
1351,This was written at the NWRRL using FORTRAN 77 and the Graphical Kernel System.,7
1352,The GIS is menu-based and is exceptionally user-friendly (Pl. 10.1).,7
1353,It opens with an outline map and the superimposition of the rather rigid zones used by the emergency planners.,7
1354,Full zoom facilities are available at any stage.,7
1355,In any emergency it is vital to have high-quality data on the distribution of population and resources.,7
1356,The system incorporates digitized data on the distribution of all domestic and non-domestic properties in the town together with digitized road centre-line data.,7
1357,"Both sets of data were provided by Pinpoint Analysis Ltd, who are undertaking this digitizing task for the entire country.",7
1358,"Other spatially referenced data incorporated into the system include those on the distribution of schools, medical and transport services which can be displayed and supplementary information about them obtained.",7
1359,The GIS permits population estimates to be made for any arbitrary rectangular region on the map.,7
1360,"Most significantly, it incorporates a shortest path algorithm which uses the road network to find optimal routes between user-defined start and end nodes.",7
1361,"Although predating the RRL initiative by several years — and, indeed the emergence of GIS as a major research area — we should remind ourselves  of Openshaw's work on appraising nuclear reactor sites.",7
1362,"Using what would now be called GIS skills, Openshaw (1980) examined over 13 000 1 km grid squares in the UK which intersect the coastline and related these to data from the 1971 Census (which were made available for such grid squares).",7
1363,"He demonstrated that there is an abundance of ‘remote’ sites, in contrast to the official view that such sites were increasingly hard to find.",7
1364,He suggested that in early spatial searches for sites ‘only a small number were ever identified in the first place because rigorous searches could not be performed by manual means with poor quality data’(Openshaw 1980: 289).,7
1365,Heywood and Cornelius (1989) have shown how GIS can be used for monitoring possible radiation releases and thus the relevance of GIS in nuclear emergency planning and monitoring.,7
1366,"They propose a national radiological spatial information system and, in a pilot project in Cumbria, have integrated several layers of data within ARC/INFO to show what this might involve (Fig. 10.2).",7
1367,Such data include those from the Population and Agricultural Censuses point data from rain gauge sites and radiation monitoring stations.,7
1368,"As an example, the system is used to determine restriction zones for the movement of sheep after the explosion at Chernobyl in 1986.",7
1369,This is done by finding areas of high rainfall and parishes with high sheep populations.,7
1370,"The map overlay of point and area information shows generally good agreement with the restriction zones imposed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, with the exception of a small area to the south-east of Cumbria, bordering on Lancashire.",7
1371,The British government carried out a review of its arrangements for handling nuclear accidents overseas following the Chernobyl accident.,7
1372,"The DoE, through Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution (HMIP), was given the task of co-ordinating a national response plan, installing the radiation monitoring network and acting as lead government department in an emergency (HMSO 1988).",7
1373,"The monitoring network has become known as the radioactive incident monitoring network (RIMNET) and has, as its prime responsibility, the detection of abnormal increases in radiation levels within the UK of the kind that might arise from an overseas nuclear accident.",7
1374,The full implementation of the RIMNET system will take some time.,7
1375,By the end of 1988 gamma radiation dose monitors had been installed at 46 meteorological stations as part of phase 1 of the development programme.,7
1376,Radiation readings are taken every hour at each station and are transmitted to a central computer which analyses the data.,7
1377,"The current criterion for alert is two readings of three times normal background, either successively at the same site or simultaneously at two adjacent sites.",7
1378,"The dissemination of information in the event of an incident is dealt with at three levels: the first is the normal system of press notices; the second is the use of teletext and viewdata (Ceefax and Prestel) to get direct to members of the public at their homes or places of work; the third is the use of Telecom Gold electronic mail to get more technical details to various official bodies, water authorities (Jackson 1989).",7
1379,Phase 2 of the RIMNET scheme will be completed by the end of 1991 when between 80 and 90 monitoring sites will have been established.,7
1380,"Given very wide regional and local variations in deposition, questions must be raised about the effectiveness of such a small network; local authorities will need to supplement it with their own networks.",7
1381,There are important analytical problems to be addressed concerning the siting of such monitoring equipment and these are elaborated on later.,7
1382,"Abroad, Kaspar (1981) has discussed a computer-based exercise, with GIS overtones, involving the simulated evacuation of the population living in the vicinity of the Neckarwestheim nuclear power plant in Baden Württemberg.",7
1383,"In the scenario he outlines, an area affected by radioactive releases is determined, the population within that area is allocated to reception areas (with capacity constraints), evacuation routes are identified and traffic restrictions implemented.",7
1384,"Little detail is provided, however, and it is thus difficult to evaluate his work fully.",7
1385,Dangermond (1985) describes the use of the ARC/INFO NETWORK module for use in emergency planning situations.,7
1386,"He describes how a road network is digitized and subsequently analysed using allocation, districting and routeing algorithms.",7
1387,"Allocation determines which arcs in the network will be allocated to a particular node or centre; districting makes it possible to outline rapidly sets of polygons to define specific areas of interest (districts) and to summarize their characteristics; routeing provides a minimum path algorithm through the network, the arcs of which can be assigned weights road conditions, road capacity .",7
1388,"Dangermond gives several examples in his paper including the use of NETWORK for the allocation of emergency vehicles, optimum routeing of fire engines from garages to the accident scene and the movement of spills through sewers and river networks.",7
1389,"When combined with the other facilities in ARC/INFO, quite complex disaster management scenarios can be handled.",7
1390,", earthquake fault zones can be combined with data on housing density and structural details to predict earthquake damage levels and these data then related to the network model.",7
1391,Vincent (1989) illustrates the use of ARC/INFO and its NETWORK module for finding safe routes for chlorine transhipment on the road and rail systems of north-west England (Pl. 10.2).,7
1392,"In this case, population density data for a 1 km buffer on either side of network arcs were overlaid on the network itself to act as weights for the minimum path algorithm.",7
1393,Chosen routes were those which minimized population distance.,7
1394,Hazardous waste disposal,7
1395,"There can be little doubt that a GIS approach has wide applicability in all sorts of location problems where the goal is to minimize (, as conventionally, maximize) accessibility to a population.",7
1396,A particularly good application is to the search for potential sites for the disposal of nuclear and non-nuclear (but hazardous) wastes.,7
1397,We discuss here some relevant work on the siting of facilities for the disposal of nuclear wastes before examining those for non-nuclear wastes.,7
1398,The major contribution to informed debate about the search for sites for the disposal of nuclear wastes has come from a group of geographers (Openshaw 1989) and a GIS approach to this problem can pay high dividends.,7
1399,The work of Carver (see Openshaw 1989: Ch. 7) is an interesting example.,7
1400,One advantage is the ability to model a range of alternatives by allowing particular criteria to enter or be omitted from the polygon overlay operation.,7
1401,"Conceptually, what is offered is little more than an automated ‘sieve mapping’ that land-use planners have used for many years, but the whole procedure is speeded up by many orders of magnitude using GIS software.",7
1402,The authors examine both near-surface sites and deep repositories (which use more restricted population criteria and allow offshore locations to enter).,7
1403,"Data layers include geological maps, conservation areas, transport routes, petrochemical facilities and demographic data.",7
1404,"As different layers are added sequentially we see how the proportion of available land shrinks (Pl. 10.3); , when geological criteria are set in the search for a deep repository, 25 of land area remains and the addition of the population density layer reduces this to 24 .",7
1405,"However, adding a proximity to transport constraint lowers this to 12 ; .",7
1406,We cannot pretend GIS is a solution to the political problems of negotiation and justification but at the very least the openness of the procedures goes some way towards satisfying a worried public.,7
1407,GIS research into site selection for non-nuclear hazardous waste has been almost exclusively conducted in North America and has yet to be matched in the UK.,7
1408,"Jensen and Christiansen (1986), working in the south-eastern USA, use a raster approach (with a pixel resolution of 20 m&sup2;) and Boolean overlay to ‘weed out’ particular sites, those which are poorly drained, environmentally sensitive or inaccessible (see also Stewart 1987).",7
1409,Environmental monitoring of sites for the disposal of toxic waste is of particular concern in the USA.,7
1410,"The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) legislation of 1980 (‘Superfund’) requires the cleaning up of the worst landfill sites, of which some 800 had been identified by the Environmental Protection Agency by 1986 (Foresman 1986).",7
1411,A major worry has been the threat posed by groundwater pollution and some research has been conducted on using GIS to monitor this (Merchant 1987; Barringer 1987; von Braun 1988).,7
1412,"This is an important topic since 95 of rural households in the USA consume only groundwater, while half the US population consumes some groundwater (Merchant 1987).",7
1413,"Clearly, the research demands access to exceptionally good environmental data, usually in three dimensions.",7
1414,"As Foresman (1986) suggests, we might expect remote sensing technology to play a major role.",7
1415,"Merchant (1987) , use the image processing system ERDAS to construct an index of vulnerability to groundwater pollution; this uses variables depth to water table, soil type, slope (see Estes 1987 for a similar approach).",7
1416,Barringer (1987) overlay data on soil type and geology with that of groundwater quality (hardness and corrosivity measures) and build a linear model which shows that the background environmental variables are good predictors of the water quality indices.,7
1417,"Again, a raster-based approach is used.",7
1418,"A further example is work by von Braun (1988) who uses pMAP to look at exposure of organic and metallic compounds in groundwater in the vicinity of Tucson airport, Arizona.",7
1419,Using plume models that predict the movement of contaminants she is able to intersect the results with data on current well locations and to assess which water supply areas are worst contaminated.,7
1420,Overlaying the results with residential location data provides ‘maps delineating location-specific exposures for each residence in each time-period’(von Braun 1988; 1160).,7
1421,"In principle, it is then possible to compare such ‘doses’ with epidemiological data, indicating a link from a hazard event to assessment of health outcomes.",7
1422,Attention should be drawn to Foresman's comment that the US Geological Survey (USGS)(at the EROS Data Centre) have successfully linked ARC/INFO to a model of groundwater flow (Foresman 1986: 260).,7
1423,This kind of link between GIS and other modelling programs is to be warmly welcomed and parallels work at the NWRRL in linking GIS and air pollution plume models.,7
1424,Natural hazards and disaster management,7
1425,Several studies in recent papers have shown the effectiveness of GIS in mitigating the effects of major natural hazards.,7
1426,"Berke and Ruch (1985), , describe a GIS for assessing the impacts of hurricanes on the Texas Gulf coast.",7
1427,Hurricane damage through high winds and tidal surges causes an immense amount of destruction and poses a major threat to many coastal communities in the USA.,7
1428,"It has been estimated, , that during the mid 1970s some 50 million US citizens were hurricane winds of over 160 km/h and 6 million were hurricane surge (Brinkman 1975).",7
1429,"The system described by Berke and Ruch (1985) is raster-based and has an interesting modelling component called SLOSH (Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes).",7
1430,"SLOSH is able to estimate still water surge by grid cell for various hurricane intensities, angles of approach to the shoreline, forward movement speeds and landfall locations.",7
1431,Additional algorithms are used to model total building damage costs for each grid cell based on water-depth and speed-depth rating curves.,7
1432,Hobeika and Jamei (1985) describe the MASSeVACuation (MASSVAC) simulation software designed to analyse and evaluate traffic evacuation plans given a natural disaster in an urban area.,7
1433,The system comprises three interrelated modules: community and disaster type characteristics module; population distribution module; network evacuation module.,7
1434,The type of natural disaster determines the time period within which the road network has to be evacuated.,7
1435,The control and management strategies are directly correlated to each specific disaster scenario.,7
1436,MASSVAC is quite flexible and various user-defined road network options are available : traffic signal timings on the road network; one-way traffic; reserved lanes for special vehicles those of the emergency services.,7
1437,Hobeika and Jamei have tested MASSVAC on various evacuation scenarios for Virginia Beach City to determine evacuation times for flood and hurricane conditions.,7
1438,", they suggest that the model provided reasonable and reliable evacuation times.",7
1439,Southworth (1989) have enhanced the MASSVAC model with the addition of a colour graphics module which they call MVOPL.,7
1440,This module has been developed using IBM's Graphics Kernel System and provides a number of display screens.,7
1441,"The most interesting are those which portray population flows as scaled ribbons on the network diagram, and evacuation shelter capacities as bar diagrams.",7
1442,The diagrams are updated periodically during the course of the simulation.,7
1443,"In dry parts of the world, Australia, forest and bush fires are an important natural hazard and some attention has been given to the ways in which GIS might help examine their potential impacts.",7
1444,"Kessell (1988) describes a PC-based GIS called PREPLAN (PRistine Environment Planning LANguage) which is a natural area management, land-use planning and fire modelling system developed for the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, PREPLAN comprises four modules: a simple raster-based GIS; a grid cell resource database; a wide range of vegetation, fuel, fire behaviour, erosion and land-use models; tabular, statistical and colour graphics output system.",7
1445,"With this system real-time fire growth can be modelled, taking into account changes in terrain, fuel and temporal changes in the weather.",7
1446,"Kessell points out that uncontrollable fires are recurrent phenomena in many parts of Australia, causing damage in the hundreds of millions of dollars and significant loss of life.",7
1447,Systems PREPLAN can provide the user with sound models of the behaviour patterns of fire and are therefore of enormous value in land-use planning.,7
1448,"One of the most widespread natural hazards is flooding, and the potential for loss of property, risk to life and general social disruption is large.",7
1449,"One interesting example of a GIS approach to flood damage estimation is the ANUFLOOD package which was developed in the early 1980s following detailed flood damage studies for flood-prone coastal towns in northern New South Wales, Australia (Smith and Greenaway, 1988).",7
1450,"The ANUFLOOD system requires locational and building type data on individual properties, stage-damage curves relating the average damage that would result from overfloor flooding to differing depths for each property type, and lastly, flood frequency flood height expressed as a probability.",7
1451,Output from the system is both tabular and graphical.,7
1452,Of particular interest is the construction of maps showing the expected annual amounts of damage for gridded flood-prone areas.,7
1453,"ANUFLOOD also contains modules which permit the investigation of various flood damage mitigation options, property height raising, levee construction and flood proofing.",7
1454,Environmental epidemiology,7
1455,"The possibilities sketched above relate to emergency planning, the search for hazardous sites, and risk assessment.",7
1456,To what extent can GIS help if an event occurs?,7
1457,"What, , of the health consequences?",7
1458,There is a rich tradition of epidemiological work in geography and with the increasing availability of spatially referenced medical data the scope for GIS applications is wide (Gatrell 1987).,7
1459,", Diggle (1990) assess the hypothesis that cancer of the larynx is associated with proximity to a now-closed incinerator and develop a statistical model from the theory of spatial point processes to test this.",7
1460,This would have been impossible without the link provided from postcoded data (increasingly available from sources cancer registries) to Ordnance Survey (OS) grid references.,7
1461,"Such a link is provided by the Central Postcode Directory, which matches all 1.5 million unit postcodes in the UK to grid references.",7
1462,When the cases of laryngeal cancer are compared with a null distribution (provided by the distribution of much more common lung cancer) the hypothesis is given strong support.,7
1463,"Although the proposed method is novel, it is but one of an increasingly large number of methods designed to detect and model ‘clusters’ of disease (see, , Cuzick and Edwards 1990).",7
1464,"The work of Diggle (1990) examined only a single point source, though it generalizes to multiple sources and to linear hazards .",7
1465,As a second example of health work linked to hazard studies we may cite the research being conducted by Cross (1989) on childhood leukaemia.,7
1466,There are numerous hypotheses concerning the aetiology of this disease (from ionizing radiation to viral transmission) and Cross's approach is to collect digital data designed to test some of these hypotheses and to use ARC/INFO to display and analyse results.,7
1467,", one hypothesis concerns the role of electromagnetic radiation, a source of which is overhead high-voltage transmission lines as noted earlier.",7
1468,If these are digitized and buffer zones constructed around them (Fig. 10.3) we can quite easily test hypotheses about prevalence in such buffer zones as compared with prevalence outside.,7
1469,"However, we should bear in mind the earlier point about the resolution of the data, since such electromagnetic effects have a very weak effect beyond perhaps 50 m (Wertheimer and Leeper 1982).",7
1470,"There has been a suspicion for many years that high rates of stomach cancer in parts of Wales may be linked to soil chemistry, specifically such factors as zinc/copper ratios, and to lead content in water supplies.",7
1471,Matthews (1989) has used data from the Regional Cancer Registry (morbidity mortality data) and data on trace elements to examine this link.,7
1472,Since the latter are available for a 5 km raster the registration data are assigned to these grid squares using the OS grid reference.,7
1473,"As with any such study there are the usual problems of ecological analysis and influences of migration, together with issues of separating out the risk factors under investigation from possible confounding factors.",7
1474,"In the USA, Morrill's report on the beginnings of a $15m. study into the possible radiation doses received as result of radiation releases by the Hanford (Washington State) nuclear complex would seem to cry out for GIS skills to be applied (Morrill 1989).",7
1475,The research project will employ plume dispersion models to model dispersal by wind and will need to integrate this and other environmental data with detailed demographic records.,7
1476,To some extent this line of approach was anticipated by Johnson (1981) in his study of exposure to plutonium fall-out from the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant near Denver (see Zeigler 1983: 47–8).,7
1477,"Using soil samples he constructed a contoured risk surface and then mapped excess cancers in various distance bands, detecting a marked distance decay effect.",7
1478,Research problems and prospects,7
1479,"The work reviewed above suggests that the application of GIS techniques to hazard assessment, emergency planning and environmental monitoring is both actually and potentially an important research area with many challenging problems.",7
1480,"Undoubtedly, the GISs of the 1990s will look very different from their rather primitive ancestors.",7
1481,"Computer power is becoming cheaper, digital data more readily available, and GISs are becoming hybrid systems involving other technologies.",7
1482,In this last section we highlight some important research areas as we see them.,7
1483,"Doubtless there are many others, such is the surge of interest in GIS technology.",7
1484,Data availability,7
1485,"We should first consider the availability and quality of data concerning the populations who may be at risk from the storage and transport of hazardous substances, from toxic air pollution, from flooding .",7
1486,"Such data are crucial, either for assisting the emergency services to make assessments about resources they need to deploy in such events, or for high-quality estimates to be made of risk.",7
1487,"Within the public domain in the UK we must rely on data from the most recent Population Census, the lowest level being that for enumeration districts (EDs).",7
1488,As is well known (Rhind 1983) these contain  on average perhaps 150–200 households and 400–500 people.,7
1489,"The boundaries of EDs have not been widely digitized, unlike the higher-level electoral wards.",7
1490,"However, the centroids of EDs are available as 100 m grid references and artificial ED ‘polygons’ can be created if necessary.",7
1491,In some instances such data will suffice; in many cases they will have to suffice as nothing better is available.,7
1492,But in some areas EDs are very extensive physical units and the shapes will be quite distorted.,7
1493,"Furthermore, the scales at which population estimates are often required means that even EDs are too coarse for risk assessments.",7
1494,", in performing its quantitative risk assessments the Health and Safety Executive will rarely deal with distances from hazardous sites 1 km (Petts 1988) and census data will not offer sufficient resolution for accurate population estimates to be made.",7
1495,"It should be pointed out, however, that the National Radiological Protection Board currently uses 1 km grid square resolution population data from the 1971 Census in its radiological protection studies (Hallam 1981).",7
1496,"It would seem that, despite the costs involved, they should consider investing in the very detailed digital data (Pinpoint Address Code (PAC)) provided by Pinpoint Analysis Ltd.",7
1497,This area of application would appear to be an obvious market for such a product.,7
1498,A useful research exercise would be to compare the use of census and PAC data in deriving quantitative risk assessments and this is an interesting research problem.,7
1499,Even with PAC data some assumptions would need to be made about numbers of persons per household if good population estimates were to be made.,7
1500,"More generally, we need to consider the availability of large databases for hazard studies and emergency planning and this is an area ripe for major initiatives.",7
1501,In the UK we seem to be lagging well behind the USA in the construction of databases on hazardous sites and especially hazard events those involving toxic releases.,7
1502,", Lioy and Daisey (1987), in their work on the monitoring of toxic air pollution in New Jersey, construct what they term a ‘microinventory’ for each of three towns, comprising the locations of chemical plants, metal processing plants, paint spray manufacturers .",7
1503,Some attribute information is available for these.,7
1504,"More closely linked to GIS is work by McMaster and Johnson (1986) who perform a very detailed inventory of hazardous materials (both stored and transported) in Santa Monica, California.",7
1505,"Although the raster displays are very crude it is simple to answer spatial queries concerning the locations of people (, particular age groups) within certain distances of toxic hazard sites.",7
1506,"We have data on some hazardous sites (e.g. those regulated by CIMAH) in the UK but a much more comprehensive approach should be adopted, especially if we are serious in the search for environmental associations with chronic diseases.",7
1507,The same is true for toxic releases.,7
1508,"In the USA the Environmental Protection Agency produces an Acute Hazards Events Database while the Department of Transportation has a database recording details of 25 000 releases of toxic materials; such details include locational information, type and amount of material released, mode of release and resulting injuries or  deaths (Cutter and Solecki 1989).",7
1509,"Can we not use GIS technology to construct ‘risk mosaics’(Zeigler 1983), at a variety of spatial scales, akin to Hewitt and Burton's ‘hazardousness’ of a place?",7
1510,"In the UK only a handful of county emergency planning departments (Cumbria, ) have built up resource databases in digital form and this needs to be promoted.",7
1511,"Further afield, we need to recognize that some disasters (most obviously Chernobyl) will have implications for one country environmental monitoring should take place with some kind of international co-ordination.",7
1512,"There will also be movements of hazardous cargoes across frontiers and there are clearly problems of risk assessment and planning for emergencies at or near international boundaries, or at sea and airports.",7
1513,"As noted above, the work of Fedra (1989) is a major step in this direction, and links need to be forged between initiatives in the UK and the rest of Europe.",7
1514,"databases on hazardous wastes, attention has already been drawn to the waste disposal plans prepared by WRAs.",7
1515,"These give details of present site locations and some indication of permitted wastes, though little or no information on closed and abandoned sites.",7
1516,"However, for details of disposal the individual site licences must be consulted.",7
1517,"The former Hazardous Waste Inspectorate operated a large database on all sites, with details of permitted wastes, including allowable quantities.",7
1518,"The database was created by a commercial company, Aspinwalls Ltd.",7
1519,There are numerous potentially usable databases for environmental epidemiological work.,7
1520,"OPCS, , is a major data repository for medical statistics and their various Monitor Series are of use, though only at the scale of district health authority and above (see Gatrell and Lovett 1988 for an example).",7
1521,Regional health authorities will produce mortality data at ward level.,7
1522,"However, if cancers are of interest it is more appropriate to obtain data from regional cancer registries; these data are morbidity mortality data and are therefore more valuable.",7
1523,The data are postcoded and may have some occupational details.,7
1524,", we have received data from the Regional Cancer Registry in Manchester comprising all cancers of the larynx and lung notified between 1974 and 1984.",7
1525,"This large data set, to which grid references have now been added, comprises information about nearly 40 000 individuals.",7
1526,"It has now been copied into INGRES, a relational database management system, permitting queries to be made about subsets of the data; , all males between the ages of 25 and 64 suffering from laryngeal cancer.",7
1527,Other data sources on cancers are independent registries of malignancies.,7
1528,"An example is that on leukaemias, managed by the Leukaemia Research Fund Centre in Leeds (Alexander 1989).",7
1529,"It should be noted that there are frequently major discrepancies between the regional registries and the specialist registries, partly because the latter receive notifications directly from consultants.",7
1530,"Indeed, working directly with consultants proves invaluable in gaining access to high-quality morbidity data.",7
1531,Two other potential sources of data are worth mentioning.,7
1532,"First, attention  should be drawn to the new directive from the Department of Health to regional and district health authorities to review the health of the population.",7
1533,"This means in practice that district medical officers are charged with preparing an annual report, presenting and interpreting epidemiological data, identifying local health problems and evaluating service outcomes.",7
1534,Lancaster University is already heavily involved in the work of Preston District Health Authority in this area.,7
1535,"Second, family health service authorities (FHSAs), are also required to take on these roles, but from the viewpoint of primary health care services.",7
1536,"FHSAs (which correspond to non-metropolitan counties and to metropolitan boroughs) hold large databases on services provided by general practitioners; , uptake of immunization and screening for breast and cervical cancers.",7
1537,"Is it, we wonder, possible to contemplate bringing together some of these data sources to form a National Online Health Information System (NOHIS), to parallel that for employment and unemployment (Townsend 1987)?",7
1538,"This might include data on morbidity and mortality, uptake of preventative medicine, service use and availability, at both primary and hospital level.",7
1539,"It would be a useful management tool, particularly the reorganization taking place in the National Health Service.",7
1540,It should not be forgotten that hazards themselves have geographical distributions yet there has been little effort in the UK to develop public domain databases.,7
1541,Are there hazard-prone areas?,7
1542,Is there a regional differentiation in hazard type?,7
1543,"These are, , commercially important questions and a good deal of money is going into the collection of such data by insurance companies.",7
1544,One well known database is Major Hazard Incident Data Service (MHIDAS) global industrial hazards database which is currently being developed by the Safety and Reliability Directorate the Major Hazards Assessment Unit of the UK Health and Safety Directorate.,7
1545,This system currently runs in dBASE II and contains 3000 items of professionally assessed information on major hazards coded into some 24 separate fields.,7
1546,"Unfortunately, the spatial referencing is poor and with some effort this could easily be remedied.",7
1547,"It is, , little use when recording a chemical spill into an Egyptian river to have entered into the appropriate field ‘the Nile’— after all, this river is some 6480 km long!",7
1548,"Here, in our view, is a classic case of the absence of a geographical input rendering the data of limited value.",7
1549,"In some cases, good hazard data exist but have simply not yet found their way into a GIS.",7
1550,A case in point is inland and coastal flooding.,7
1551,Most river authorities have detailed maps showing the geographical limits of floods their return periods.,7
1552,"Within the next decade, as the privatized water companies develop their GIS, we shall see a massive amount of data conversion in this area.",7
1553,"This development, together with the availability of digital terrain models, will allow quite sophisticated flood forecasting models to be developed within a GIS framework.",7
1554,"As sea-levels rise in the next 20–30 years the ‘greenhouse’ effect, this very practical use of GIS technology is likely to become commonplace and of considerable practical importance.",7
1555,Spatial statistics,7
1556,Another way in which there needs to be a between statistical methods and GIS is in the area of spatial sampling and estimation from spatial samples.,7
1557,This is clearly an important issue in radiation monitoring as the discussion of RIMNET above implies.,7
1558,"As an example, Peirson (1988) has reviewed the evidence on artificial radioactivity in Cumbria and shows maps of the distribution of certain radionuclides as contoured surfaces.",7
1559,The point worth making here is that there are many alternative schemes for interpolating from irregular point data (Lam 1983).,7
1560,"One method , kriging (now available as part of the UNIRAS software), offers not only a contoured surface but also an estimate of the standard error at any point on the map.",7
1561,Where this is high it suggests that an additional sampling station might be set up.,7
1562,Such techniques are now standard in environmental science (see Streit 1981 for an application to rainfall monitoring) and need to be promoted vigorously in hazard studies (Estes 1987).,7
1563,Related to this problem is that of making population estimates for new zones that result from overlay operations.,7
1564,"We may want to count numbers living within plumes, circles of fixed radius, buffer zones .",7
1565,"Existing GIS techniques usually base the estimates on area-weighted shares, a new polygon created by ‘slicing’ an existing area in half is assigned half the population of that source unit.",7
1566,"This may be quite absurd in some cases, notably where population is spatially clustered within a physically large ED.",7
1567,"At the NWRRL work is (Flowerdew and Green 1989) to solve such problems using the EM algorithm and the statistical modelling package GLIM, which has been interfaced with ARC/INFO.",7
1568,Operations research methods and simulation,7
1569,While there is some research activity in linking statistical models to GIS there would seem to be scope for further applications of operations research techniques to GIS problems.,7
1570,"Within some sophisticated GIS ARC/INFO there are some useful algorithms (shortest path calculations), but GIS developers have failed to realize the natural links between GIS functions and many operations research techniques.",7
1571,Over the last 20 years or so a large theoretical literature has been developed to provide tools for the solution of many problems associated with emergency planning (Kolesar 1981).,7
1572,One important class of problems is the selection of locations for the emergency service units.,7
1573,"The choice of locations need not be for permanent bases, but can also include dynamic repositioning of units as circumstances dictate (Kolesar and Walker 1974).",7
1574,In any major emergency a typical problem is the assignment of resources to demands.,7
1575,"If resources are held at one set of locations and the demands are at another and the costs of transportation are known, how do we allocate the resources most efficiently?",7
1576,"In a major emergency, , there might  be a need to supply blood products held at regional blood banks to hospitals.",7
1577,"This, , is the classic transportation problem and its solution is well known.",7
1578,"As far as we know the microcomputer-based emergency response system devised by Belardo (1983), is the only GIS-like software to incorporate this algorithm.",7
1579,"In this system, the solution to the transportation problem is shown graphically on the road network, which is displayed on the computer screen.",7
1580,As a last example of the potential role of operations research in GIS and disaster management we are reminded of the logistic problems that faced the Peel Regional Police Force during the Mississauga evacuation mentioned previously (Scanlon and Padgham 1980).,7
1581,During the early states of the phased evacuation the logistical problem facing the police was the street-by-street warning of the population to make ready for evacuation.,7
1582,Speed was of the essence and manpower was limited.,7
1583,"Here, then, is a familiar operations research network problem: all roads have to be traversed the journey length/time is a minimum.",7
1584,"This is the so-called Chinese postman problem, which provides a Hamiltonian circuit through the arcs (as compared with the travelling salesman problem which is a minimum route through the network nodes).",7
1585,"In fact, the police force lacked access to any digital information and although the evacuation went off without a hitch there is little doubt that a GIS containing the Chinese postman algorithm could have provided efficient routes and also have guaranteed that no road was missed from the warning sweep.",7
1586,"Simulating the likely consequences of real events is an important, but almost untouched, GIS research area.",7
1587,"As an educational tool, simulation is not only an invaluable training aid for personnel who may one day be confronted with a real situation but is sometimes the only method for dealing with improbable but possible events.",7
1588,"In the UK the Institution of Chemical Engineers has produced a computer simulation program specifically for training personnel at large chemical plants who may one day have to manage major fires and toxic releases (Institution of Chemical Engineers, no date).",7
1589,"Although not a thoroughbred GIS, this package, based on an IBM PC, does make use of map data and site plans can be displayed.",7
1590,Decision support systems and GIS,7
1591,"A decision support system (DSS) can be considered as an integration of computer hardware and software specifically designed to complement the human thought process in problem-solving, decision-making and information processing (Benbasat 1977).",7
1592,Berke and Stubbs (1989) a DSS can often be conceptualized as a tool to be used as part of an interactive learning process allowing the user to undertake ‘what if’ analyses and view the consequences of such alternatives.,7
1593,The basic components of a DSS comprise: data storage files; data analysis models; display and interactive use technology.,7
1594,These three components are  managed by: a data management subsystem; a model management subsystem; and an interactive dialogue subsystem.,7
1595,Berke and Stubbs indicate that the interactive dialogue subsystem and the display and interactive use component are particularly critical for the effective use of a DSS because they provide the interaction between the user and the machine.,7
1596,These features isolate the user from the technicalities of the computer and encourage a dialogue based on the user's judgements imposing the hardware engineer's or computer programmer's discipline on the user.,7
1597,"In this sense ARC/INFO macros, do, to a certain extent, shield the novice from a bewildering number of options, though such a system is most certainly not conversational and in several respects is very simple as compared with a comprehensive DSS.",7
1598,"The integration of GIS and DSS for hazard mitigation is an active research area in the USA, Japan and Europe.",7
1599,"Dong (1988), , have developed microcomputer-based DSS for earthquake hazard mitigation.",7
1600,This system provides a map display of the threatened region and access to spatially referenced data to facilitate hazard zoning for a given earthquake magnitude.,7
1601,", the software calculates damage estimates and building repair costs for any geographical area.",7
1602,"Fedra and Reitsma (1989) describe a DSS-GIS developed by the Advanced Computer Applications group at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), Austria, which provides an interactive, graphics-oriented framework and post-processor for the risk assessment package SAFETI (Technica 1984).",7
1603,"Raw data plant locations, weather data and population distribution can be displayed as overlays on a basic land-use map.",7
1604,The graphical interface provides a link to SAFETI's databases and consequence modelling and risk estimates and risk contours can be produced.,7
1605,Expert systems are likely to have a significant impact on DSS and GIS in hazard management (Fedra and Reitsma 1989).,7
1606,"Important characteristics of expert systems are that they provide advice in problem-solving based on the knowledge of experts, facilitate learning through experience and allow the use of natural language processing.",7
1607,"One of the most advanced applications of expert systems to DSS and GIS is a hazardous substances and industrial risk management system (IRIMS — Ispra Risk Management Support System) developed at IIASA the Joint Research Centre of the Commission of the European Communities at Ispra, Italy (Fedra 1987; Fedra 1986).",7
1608,"This large system, designed for a SUN workstation has the following main elements: an intelligent user interface; an information system including knowledge bases, databases, inference machine and database management system; a simulation system; a DSS.",7
1609,The large geographical database held in the system covers Europe as far east as the Urals.,7
1610,"Roads, railways, lakes, rivers, major settlements, chemical storage facilities and political boundaries can be displayed and used as overlays for the various modules that examine the impacts of chemical spills into the atmosphere and river systems.",7
1611,IRIMS uses a number of expert systems techniques including: a language input parser based on sideways chaining and rule values which allow Bayesian  probabilistic reasoning to identify possible user intentions/hypotheses; fuzzy set methods to translate uncertainty and ambiguity in the databases or user specifications into linguistic or graphical descriptions; and various rule-based pre- and post-processors to define appropriate context-dependent default input values.,7
1612,"Even in this brief description of DSS it can be see that, as presently configured, most GIS are rather dumb systems requiring intelligent, very computer-literate users.",7
1613,"But in an emergency or disaster situation, the knowledge base must be in the computer system and there should be no skill barrier to access the system.",7
1614,"In this respect we believe that the next generation of GIS will be more akin to DSS than to sophisticated mapping packages, as is presently the case.",7
1615,The development of such GIS will surely be at the forefront of any research agenda.,7
1616,Real-time GIS,7
1617,The ultimate test of the role of GIS in emergency/hazard situations is their response time as external information is fed into the system.,7
1618,Two approaches can be adopted to minimize the response time: a simple approach is to devise portable GIS which can be taken to the hazard; a more complex solution is to couple the GIS to real-time monitoring systems.,7
1619,Probably the outstanding example of the portability approach is the USA's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) award-winning emergency response package called CAMEO (NOAA 1988).,7
1620,The best implementation of CAMEO runs on an Apple Macintosh and makes full use of the Hypercard environment.,7
1621,"The system comes with three components: CODEBREAKER which uses intelligent software to identify hazardous chemical labels, summarize the chemical properties and indicate health risks; MAP which can display digital and scanned maps of the incident site; AIR MODEL which is an atmospheric modelling program linked to CODEBREAKER and MAP.",7
1622,AIR MODEL also has the facility to link on-line to weather data sources and can estimate the scope of potential downwind hazard zones.,7
1623,CAMEO is designed to be carried on emergency vehicles and has undergone successful on-scene field trials with the Seattle Fire Department.,7
1624,An alternative approach to real-time monitoring is to develop software capable of receiving data from external monitoring systems.,7
1625,"Southworth (1989) describe an operational, prototype Real-time Traffic Monitoring and Analysis System (RTMAS) whose purpose is to record and warn of the build-up of significant urban population evacuation in times of threat.",7
1626,"RTMAS integrates three software components: GURU, an expert system; AUTOBOX, a time-series module; CROSSTALK proprietary software for transferring traffic count data from roadside counters to the IBM PS2.",7
1627,"In tracking an evacuation build-up, RTMAS collects and cumulates net traffic movements, building up a quantitative picture of the timing and directions of  evacuation.",7
1628,RTMAS has been developed for an IBM PS2/Model 80 connected via modem to software initiated by direct dial a sequence of traffic counters.,7
1629,"Currently, the system monitors traffic movements in Florida and Georgia but ultimately national coverage could be achieved.",7
1630,Systems RTMAS have great practical potential in those emergency situations where there is likely to be self-evacuation by the public.,7
1631,", there were major traffic congestion problems, as a result of self-evacuation, during Hurricane Hugo which threatened large parts of the south-west of the USA in October 1989.",7
1632,"In a similar vein, Martin (1989) describes work by Marconi Defence Systems which integrates an automatic vehicle location system with Marconi's GIS (called Tactic Plus).",7
1633,Emergency vehicles can be supplied with computers that track their spatial location.,7
1634,This information can be continuously monitored by a receiving station and then delivered to the map component of the GIS.,7
1635,What seems to be a very advanced GIS with real-time monitoring capacity for use in emergency planning has been recently developed by Plessey Defence Systems.,7
1636,"The software, called GENERICS, is from the same stable as Plessey's defence and military research.",7
1637,"Quite obviously, there is a good deal of, , classified technology which might one day be available for all sorts of hazard mitigation purposes.",7
1638,Conclusions,7
1639,It is useful to return to the earlier typology of hazards (Fig. 10.1) and to stress the links that might be made between those working on natural hazards and those working in the socio-economic domains.,7
1640,There are several examples of natural hazards whose impact might benefit from a GIS perspective that cuts across the science-social science divide.,7
1641,"These include snow and ice hazards, where impacts on transport and the need to plan road salting or gritting strategies are obvious (see Perry 1986 for the beginnings of a GIS approach).",7
1642,"It would be foolish to imagine that GIS can assist in all hazard studies, emergencies and disasters.",7
1643,"It is hard to imagine what role it could have played in the prevention or aftermath of events the Piper Alpha oil platform explosion in the North Sea, the Zeebrugge ferry disaster or the sinking of the pleasure boat on the Thames, .",7
1644,"But it might have assisted in suggesting search areas for victims of the Lockerbie air crash and, at a very different scale, in helping firemen navigate their way around King's Cross underground rail station.",7
1645,"Why, , could there not be a library of scanned plans of all underground stations, showing the detailed topography and assisting fire personnel unfamiliar with the site to direct their efforts in the search for casualties?",7
1646,", however, GIS surely has a function to perform in simulation and role-playing exercises.",7
1647,"The Cumbria emergency planning system outlined above can, , be used as an experimental tool, permitting police  and emergency planners to simulate a hazard event and to call up information on resources, to identify possible areas for evacuation, to plan routes through the transport network, .",7
1648,"There must be many opportunities for user-friendly GIS to be employed in these kinds of scenarios, either as special-purpose systems or by employing proprietary GIS packages with easy-to-use macros.",7
1649,Anyone working in the GIS research field is conscious of the links that need to be made to groups of researchers in other disciplines.,7
1650,"Nowhere, it seems, is this more apparent than in the area under consideration here.",7
1651,"We need the skills of environmental scientists, statisticians, epidemiologists and chemical engineers, not to mention those of the geographer and planner.",7
1652,"Given the spate of recent disasters, notably in the UK the time is ripe for a major initiative in the field of emergency planning and hazard studies.",7

1,SINGULARITY STRUCTURE,8
2,It has been seen that singularities inevitably occur in the solutions describing the interaction region of colliding plane waves.,8
3,"Using the line element (6.20), we have in this region  (8.1) where and are monotonically decreasing functions for positive arguments.",8
4,It is therefore inevitable that some kind of singularity will occur on the hypersurface + = 0.,8
5,"It can also be seen from (6.17), that this is the hypersurface on which the two opposing waves mutually focus , as the contraction of each wave here becomes unbounded.",8
6,This was anticipated by the discussion in Section 5.3.,8
7,"It is now appropriate to consider whether the caustics formed in this way correspond to mere coordinate singularities, or whether they are necessarily curvature singularities as they are in the Khan-Penrose solution.",8
8,It has also been pointed out previously that coordinate singularities necessarily occur in the regions II and III that contain the approaching waves.,8
9,The character and significance of these singularities must also be considered in this chapter.,8
10,8.1 Singularities,8
11,"the general theory of relativity, space-time is represented by a connected Hausdorff manifold together with a locally Lorentz metric .",8
12,"A singularity in the space-time is indicated by incomplete geodesics or incomplete curves of bounded acceleration (Hawking and Ellis, 1973).",8
13,"By definition, space-time is smooth and does not contain any irregular points.",8
14,It follows that a singularity may normally be considered as occurring only at a boundary of space-time.,8
15,"Unfortunately, no single definition of a singularity has yet been found which is applicable to all situations.",8
16,One of the more useful ways of attaching a boundary to a singular space-time is by a (bundle) -boundary construction.,8
17,The -boundary  is the projection into a space-time of a natural boundary attached to a higher-dimensional Riemannian manifold.,8
18,"In the standard -boundary construction, the Riemannian manifold is the bundle of frames over space-time having a positive definite metric induced by the affine connection.",8
19,Boundary points of the frame bundle are determined by giving end points to all Cauchy sequences which do not converge in the frame bundle.,8
20,The bundle boundary is then projected down to make a boundary for the space-time.,8
21,"the classification scheme devised by Ellis and Schmidt (1977), singularities in maximal, four-dimensional space-times can be divided into three basic types: quasiregular, non-scalar curvature and scalar curvature.",8
22,This scheme describes the singularity structure of a space-time  on which the Riemann tensor is .,8
23,It uses a -boundary construction to determine the location of singular points.,8
24,"If the -boundary is non-empty, there are only two possibilities.",8
25,"Either a point in the -boundary may be a  regular boundary point if the space-time  can be embedded in a larger space-time  the Riemann tensor is C and is an interior point in , or it may be a  singular boundary point if the space-time  is not extendable through in a  way.",8
26,A singular boundary point can then be classified this scheme.,8
27,It may be a (or )if all components of the Riemann tensor and its first derivatives evaluated in an orthonormal frame parallel propagated along an incomplete geodesic ending at are (or ).,8
28,Such frames are called PPON frames.,8
29,It may alternatively be a (or ) curvature singularity if this is not true.,8
30,"In this case it may either be categorized as a (or )if all scalars in the metric tensor , the alternating symbol , the Riemann tensor and its first derivatives are bounded, , tend to a (or -) function.",8
31,"Alternatively, it may be a (or )or a if some scalar does not tend to a (or -) function.",8
32,The most familiar class of singularities are the scalar curvature singularities.,8
33,These include the ‘big bang’ and ‘black hole’types of singularity which closely correspond to one's intuitive concept of a real physical singularity.,8
34,"As such a singularity is approached, some physical quantities diverge and all observers feel unbounded tidal forces.",8
35,The non-scalar curvature and quasiregular singularities are much less well understood and have been less fully investigated.,8
36,"Consider, , a space-time with a non-scalar curvature singularity.",8
37,"No curvature scalars diverge in this case, yet some components of the Riemann tensor evaluated in a PPON frame along an incomplete curve do not tend to  finite limits as the singularity is approached.",8
38,"The physical effect of this is that all test particles which fall into the non-scalar curvature singularity feel infinite tidal forces, but observers can move arbitrarily close to the singularity on other curves and feel no untoward effects.",8
39,"Finally, consider a space-time with a quasiregular singularity.",8
40,In all reasonable frames the Riemann tensor is completely finite.,8
41,"In this case, observers near a quasiregular singularity, including those who fall into the singularity itself, do not feel unbounded tidal forces.",8
42,All three types of singularity are found in colliding plane wave solutions.,8
43,In the following sections and chapters the singularity and global structure of particular solutions will be analysed in more detail.,8
44,The singularity in region IV,8
45,"In the exact solution of Khan and Penrose (1971) described in Chapter 3, there is a scalar curvature singularity in region IV on the hypersurface .",8
46,"However, it is not clear this type of singularity will occur in other solutions, particularly as the Khan-Penrose solution contains impulsive gravitational waves.",8
47,"This question has been considered by Szekeres (1972), who found that, for colliding gravitational waves with aligned linear polarization, a curvature singularity is inevitable.",8
48,"This work was generalized by Sbytov (1976) to plane gravitational waves with arbitrary polarization, with the same result.",8
49,"However, more recently, counterexamples to these conclusions have been obtained, in the non-aligned case by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1986c), and in the aligned case by a degenerate solution of Ferrari and Ibañez (1987b) and by the algebraically general solutions of Feinstein and Ibañez (1989).",8
50,"In these cases, the curvature scalars remain bounded on the hypersurface , and scalar polynomial curvature singularities occur in the extensions of the solution through the focusing singularity.",8
51,These exceptional cases will be considered in detail later on.,8
52,"For the present, it may simply be observed that Szekeres and Sbytov had omitted to include these cases.",8
53,Another counterexample proposed by Stoyanov (1979) has proved to be incorrect as it does not satisfy the required boundary conditions (see Section 10.2).,8
54,"The same question applied to colliding electromagnetic waves is more complicated, and the answers are less conclusive.",8
55,"Generally, one may expect that, for a combination of gravitational and electromagnetic waves, a curvature singularity in region IV will usually occur.",8
56,"However, for purely electromagnetic waves it is less clear.",8
57,"In the first exact solution of this  type, given by Bell and Szekeres (1974), the singularity on the hypersurface  was shown to be only a coordinate singularity that could easily be removed by a coordinate transformation.",8
58,"This solution, which is conformally flat in the interaction region, will be described in Chapter 14 together with the full analysis of its singularity structure as given by Clarke and Hayward (1989).",8
59,Other type D electrovac solutions have been obtained by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1987a) and Papacostas and Xanthopoulos (1988).,8
60,Further algebraically general solutions without curvature singularities can easily be constructed as will be indicated in Section 17.2.,8
61,All these have quasiregular singularities that are interpreted as Cauchy horizons on the surface .,8
62,These will be described later.,8
63,"We may conclude that, in all cases, the opposing waves mutually focus onto the hypersurface , on which the contraction of the waves is unbounded and the line element (6.20) is singular.",8
64,"Usually this will be a scalar polynomial curvature singularity, but a large class of  significant exceptions occurs.",8
65,"It is convenient to point out at this stage that, for colliding gravitational and electromagnetic waves, two of the scalar polynomial invariants (Penrose and Rindler, 1986) are given by  (8.2) It follows from this that, to prove the existence of a scalar polynomial curvature singularity, it is sufficient merely to show that the component 2 is unbounded.",8
66,"In this case either or must be unbounded, and a curvature singularity occurs.",8
67,"It would, , be useful to have a number of general theorems that could be used to determine the singularity structure of particular classes of solutions.",8
68,"the earlier results of Szekeres (1972) and Sbytov (1976), the only general theorem to date is that of Tipler (1980).",8
69,"This is in fact a straightforward generalization of a theorem of Penrose (1965b)(see also Hawking and Ellis 1973, p.263).",8
70,Quoting it directly:,8
71,(Tipler),8
72,(Tipler),8
73,This is an interesting theorem which seems to prove the existence of singularities for a large class of colliding plane waves.,8
74,"However, it requires that the metric be everywhere.",8
75,It thus excludes situations involving impulsive gravitational waves.,8
76,"It does not apply therefore to the solutions of Khan and Penrose (1971), Ferrari and Ibañez (1987 ), and the exceptional solution of Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1986 ).",8
77,Nor does it apply to the colliding electromagnetic wave solution of Bell and Szekeres (1974) in which impulsive gravitational waves are generated by the collision.,8
78,", it proves only geodesic incompleteness and says nothing about curvature singularities.",8
79,"There exists, however, a very large class of exceptional solutions in which curvature singularities do not occur.",8
80,"For gravitational waves these include a degenerate Ferrari-Ibañez (1987b) solution and the solution of Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1986b), which are respectively parts of the Schwarzschild and Kerr space-times.",8
81,"These have been described in more detail by Ferrari and Ibañez (1988), and will be described in Sections 10.5 and 13.3.",8
82,"They contain impulsive wave components, and therefore do not satisfy the conditions of Tipler's theorem.",8
83,"In all these solutions, the singularity that occurs when  corresponds to a Cauchy horizon.",8
84,"This may be followed by either a space-like, or a time-like curvature singularity.",8
85,"The latter case would indicate that, if it were possible for real observers to pass through the horizon, then most would miss this singularity.",8
86,A further class of exceptional vacuum solutions in which the curvature singularity is replaced by a Cauchy horizon has been obtained by Feinstein and Ibañez (1989).,8
87,These solutions contain a subclass in which the approaching waves have smooth wave fronts and the metric is everywhere .,8
88,They thus satisfy the conditions of Tipler's theorem.,8
89,"They are geodesically incomplete, but the focusing hypersurface in this case is only a quasiregular singularity.",8
90,These solutions thus illustrate the fact that a proof of null incompleteness does not necessarily imply the existence of a scalar polynomial curvature singularity.,8
91,The Killing-Cauchy horizons that occur in these solutions have particular significance as the caustics formed by the mutual  of the opposing waves.,8
92,"They have also been further investigated by Yurtsever (1987), who has shown that they are unstable against plane-symmetric perturbations.",8
93,It is therefore reasonable to conclude that the existence of space-like singularities is likely to be a generic feature of colliding plane wave solutions.,8
94,"This conclusion is also supported by the work of Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1987 ), who have shown that the presence of an arbitrarily small amount of dust will change a horizon into a curvature singularity.",8
95,"In these exceptional cases, it is necessary for the approaching waves to take very specific forms to achieve the appropriate solution in region IV.",8
96,The instability of the horizons in these solutions can easily be demonstrated in that they require very specific forms for the initial functions and .,8
97,Any slight variation in these functions would change the Cauchy horizon into a curvature singularity.,8
98,"Most of the exceptional solutions that have been explicitly obtained are of algebraic type D, although the solutions of Feinstein and Ibañez are algebraically general.",8
99,"Perhaps it should also be remarked that algebraic type D solutions do not necessarily have horizons singularities, a counterexample being one of the degenerate Ferrari-Ibañez (1987 ) solutions.",8
100,An alternative proof of Tipler's Theorem 8.1 has been given by Yurtsever (1988 ).,8
101,This emphasizes the role and necessity of the assumption of a strict plane symmetry.,8
102,"In this approach, the exceptional solutions that have Killing-Cauchy horizons in the interaction region do not satisfy the condition of strict plane symmetry as defined by Yurtsever.",8
103,"The structure of the singularity in the interaction region has been further analysed by Yurtsever (1988 , 1989 ), who has shown that the metric is asymptotic to an inhomogeneous Kasner solution as the singularity is approached.",8
104,"Initially (Yurtsever 1988 ), he considered the case when the approaching waves have constant aligned polarization and obtained explicit expressions which relate the asymptotic Kasner exponents along the singularity to the initial data posed along the wave fronts of the approaching waves.",8
105,"From these expressions it is clear that, for specific choices of initial data, the curvature singularity formed by the interacting waves degenerates to a coordinate singularity.",8
106,"It can also be concluded that these Killing-Cauchy horizons are unstable against small but generic perturbations of the initial data and that, in a very precise sense, ‘generic’ initial data always produce all-embracing space-like curvature singularities.",8
107,"In the subsequent paper (Yurtsever, 1989 ), he has shown that these same conclusions are also reached in the case when the polarization of the approaching waves is arbitrary.",8
108,The Khan-Penrose solution,8
109,"The solution of Khan and Penrose (1971) which has already been discussed in detail in Chapter 3, may now be reconsidered.",8
110,"It was shown there , that the scalar invariants are unbounded on the hypersurface  in region IV, where  and .",8
111,This clearly demonstrates the existence of a scalar curvature singularity on this hypersurface.,8
112,"this, there are apparent coordinate singularities  extending from it into regions II and III.",8
113,The naive singularity structure of this solution is thus as represented in Figure 3.2.,8
114,It is now necessary to consider in more detail the character of the apparent singularities in these initial regions II and III.,8
115,"As described in Section 3.3, if it is possible for real particles to pass through them, then it will be possible for those particles to subsequently look back and observe the naked singularity in region IV.",8
116,"If correct, this would provide a counterexample to the cosmic censorship hypothesis.",8
117,"It is more likely, however, that these singularities will prove to be more than artificial coordinate singularities that particles can pass through.",8
118,"Figure 8.1 Sections through surfaces = constant,= 0, when = 0, for three different (negative) values of .",8
119,"Figure 8.2 Sections through the surface = constant,= 0, for three different values of .",8
120,This question has been discussed in an interesting paper by Matzner and Tipler (1984).,8
121,"the obvious symmetry, we may concentrate on the singularity in region II.",8
122,"The first point to note is that, since the initial waves are impulsive, the interiors of both regions I and II are flat.",8
123,"For , curvature only occurs on the null boundary .",8
124,The line elements for regions I and II are respectively  (8.3).,8
125,(8.4),8
126,That these both describe flat space-time can be demonstrated by transforming (8.4) to the form (8.3) by putting .,8
127,(8.5),8
128,"It may be observed that the coordinate singularity  is effectively removed by this transformation, and there appears no reason preventing the continuation of the coordinates  through it.",8
129,"Figure 8.3 Surfaces = constant,= 0,, for different (negative) values of .",8
130,Notice that the line  is common to all surfaces.,8
131,"Matzner and Tipler proceed to investigate the properties of the null hypersurfaces = constant, working with the null Minkowski coordinates .",8
132,"Projections of these hypersurfaces are illustrated in Figures 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3.",8
133,It can be seen that as  the curvature of these hypersurfaces diverges.,8
134,"It should also be noticed that the surfaces = constant, considered as embedded in the three-space , consist of nested two-surfaces all having the line  .",8
135,"It is then possible show that the hypersurface  is not merely a coordinate singularity, but is actually a singularity of space-time in the sense that there does not exist a extension from region II to this surface.",8
136,"This can not be a curvature singularity, since the curvature tensor on it is zero.",8
137,Matzner and Tipler accordingly describe it as a ‘fold singularity’.,8
138,"With this interpretation, the structure of the Khan-Penrose solution is thus as described in Figure 8.4.",8
139,This result raises another problem.,8
140,"In the absence of the second wave, the entire space-time may be described by (8.3) for , and by (8.4) for , for all values of .",8
141,"In this case, is merely a coordinate singularity.",8
142,It has no physical significance and can be removed by a coordinate transformation.,8
143,"However, once the second wave is present, with wavefront , the above result states that  becomes a space-time singularity even for .",8
144,This seems to violate our familiar concept of causality.,8
145,The presence of the second wave seems to change the character of the prior singularity.,8
146,Figure 8.4 The singularity structure of the Khan-Penrose solution.,8
147,The resolution of this problem can be demonstrated using Figure 8.3.,8
148,The family of surfaces for = constant can be continued .,8
149,"However, there is a curvature singularity at .",8
150,"The final surface , which forms a bound for the prior surfaces, therefore contains a singularity on the line .",8
151,"In fact, this line  is actually common to the entire family of surfaces for which .",8
152,"Thus the line  must be considered as a singularity of space-time, which is identified with the point .",8
153,"In the Khan-Penrose solution, the singularities in regions II and III are topological singularities that are identified with the curvature singularity in region IV by the particular choice of coordinates.",8
154,"This point may be further clarified by considering a family of null geodesics that are initially parallel in region I, and enter region II.",8
155,"The null geodesic ,= constant, starts in region I, passes through the gravitational wave and apparently ends at the  singularity.",8
156,"This may be contrasted, however, with a neighbouring geodesic which is given using  the null Minkowski coordinates defined by (8.5), by .",8
157,This geodesic is given by .,8
158,(8.6) From this it is clear that increases indefinitely as  even for arbitrarily small values of ε.,8
159,"Thus, although the geodesic with   approaches the ‘fold singularity’ apparently at a finite distance from the curvature singularity in region IV, an arbitrarily close geodesic that is initially parallel to it in region II diverges from it and crosses into region IV before it reaches the hypersurface .",8
160,This geodesic subsequently terminates in the curvature singularity in region IV.,8
161,The projection of these two geodesics onto the plane  is illustrated in Figure 8.5.,8
162,Figure 8.5 Projections of two neighbouring null geodesics onto the plane .,8
163,"The geodesics are parallel and arbitrarily close in region II, which is flat.",8
164,It has thus been argued that the singularities  and  in regions II and III are essentially extensions of the singularity  in region IV.,8
165,The apparent non-causality that appears in the introduction of these singularities is a consequence of the projection of the space-time onto the plane .,8
166,Such a projection does not preserve causal relations.,8
167,"Although Figure 8.4 is very useful in formulating the colliding plane wave problem by dividing the space-time up into appropriate regions, in many ways it is misleading.",8
168,", it does not adequately describe the singularity structure of the solution, which appears to be non-causal.",8
169,The problem arises from the attempt to represent space-time on a two-dimensional diagram.,8
170,In many ways it would be preferable to attempt to picture a three-dimensional structure as in Figure 8.3.,8
171,"Such a picture has been drawn by Penrose, and was included in the paper of Matzner and Tipler (1984).",8
172,This structure is illustrated in Figure 8.6 where the four regions are separately represented.,8
173,"Since curvature occurs only on the boundaries of regions I, II and III, the differently shaped boundaries of these regions have to be identified artificially.",8
174,Region IV is curved and no adequate representation of it can be given.,8
175,"Using the classification scheme of Ellis and Schmidt (1977), it can be seen that the singularity in region IV of the Khan-Penrose solution is  clearly a scalar polynomial curvature singularity.",8
176,"Also the fold singularities in regions II and III that have a topological character, are quasiregular singularities since on them the curvature tensor is zero.",8
177,Figure 8.6 A three-dimensional picture of the Khan-Penrose solution with .,8
178,"The interiors of regions I, II and III are flat, but the boundaries have intrinsically different geometry.",8
179,Points on opposite sides of the wavefronts  and  must be identified.,8
180,"Region IV is curved, so its representation should be considered no more than schematic.",8
181,The structure of other solutions,8
182,In the previous section the singularity structure of the Khan-Penrose solution has been analysed in some detail.,8
183,"This has been possible because the interiors of regions I, II and III are all flat.",8
184,"In the general problem, however, it is only the background region I that is taken to be flat, and regions II and III, IV, are curved.",8
185,Consequently it is not possible to analyse the singularity structure in such detail.,8
186,"It is reasonable to assume, however, that most colliding plane wave solutions will have the same general singularity structure as that of the Khan Penrose solution.",8
187,"This in fact turns out to be the case, as will be shown here and in the following chapters.",8
188,"In almost all cases a curvature singularity develops in region IV on the hypersurface , although there is a large class of exceptional solutions in which the singularity is replaced by a Cauchy horizon.",8
189,These exceptional solutions provide the  only significant variation of the general singularity structure described above.,8
190,The structure of these solutions will be described as they are derived in the following chapters.,8
191,"It has also been shown that, for all colliding plane wave solutions, coordinate singularities necessarily occur in regions II and III.",8
192,"For vacuum solutions, in these regions one component, either 4 or 0, of the curvature tensor is non-zero.",8
193,Scalar polynomial curvature singularities therefore cannot occur.,8
194,"The coordinate singularities on the hypersurfaces  and  may thus either be quasiregular singularities if the curvature tensor on these surfaces is bounded, or they must be non-scalar curvature singularities if the curvature components become unbounded.",8
195,"It will now be argued that the topological ‘fold’ singularities of regions II and III in the Khan-Penrose solution, are also general features of all colliding plane wave solutions.",8
196,Figure 8.7 The singularity structure for colliding sandwich gravitational waves.,8
197,The shaded regions have non-zero curvature.,8
198,"If the approaching waves are ‘sandwich’ gravitational waves, then the regions behind the waves are flat.",8
199,These flat regions must be described by metrics that are equivalent to those of the Khan-Penrose solution for regions II and III.,8
200,"After all, the impulsive waves considered by Khan and Penrose may be regarded as idealizations of such waves.",8
201,"In these cases similar ‘fold’ singularities will occur, as described in Figure 8.7.",8
202,These singularities in regions II and III have been more thoroughly investigated by Konkowski and Helliwell (1989).,8
203,"By concentrating on the Szekeres (1972) family of solutions, they have shown that these are quasiregular singularities in the classification scheme of Ellis and Schmidt (1977) in the cases of impulsive and sandwich waves.",8
204,"In the alternative case of thick gravitational waves, they are non-scalar curvature singularities.",8
205,", by considering scalar wave perturbations in the impulsive  wave case, they have also shown that the quasiregular singularities are unstable and convert to scalar curvature singularities.",8
206,To consider further the general character of these coordinate singularities in regions II and III we may concentrate on region II.,8
207,"The metric in this region may be taken to be of the form (6.20), but with the metric functions ,,and all only.",8
208,"These functions may be obtained from those in region I simply by replacing by ½, or by 0.",8
209,"Considering the geodesics in this region, it is clear that there exist three conserved momentum components ,and besides the energy integral.",8
210,These are given by  (8.7) where ε may be taken to be 0 on null geodesics and 1 on time-like geodesics.,8
211,"Using (8.7), we obtain the equation  (8.8) Expressions for and in region II can be obtained from (7.2) and (7.8) in the form  (8.9) With these,(8.8) may be integrated to give  (8.10)",8
212,It may immediately be seen from this that no time-like or null geodesics with either or non-zero can avoid crossing the surface  into  region IV before reaching the surface on which .,8
213,The only exception occurs when .,8
214,This clearly manifests the character of the fold singularity as described in the previous section.,8
215,"In colliding plane wave problems, what is essentially a coordinate singularity for a single wave is transformed into a fold singularity the collision by the presence of curvature singularities at the points  and .",8
216,"Generally these are associated with a space-like singularity on , but as described above, there are exceptional cases in which this singularity is replaced by a horizon.",8
217,"However, even in these cases, it is found that there exist distribution valued singularities just at these points.",8
218,"From this, it may be argued that the presence of fold singularities in regions II and III appears to be a general feature of colliding plane wave problems.",8
219,"It has thus been argued that the general structure of all colliding plane wave solutions is as illustrated in Figure 8.6 with  with the possible exception that, for some solutions, the curvature singularity in region IV is replaced by a Cauchy horizon.",8
220,Figure 8.8 The general structure of colliding plane wave solutions related to the initial hypersurface on which initial Cauchy data is set.,8
221,It is also appropriate to attempt to relate this general singularity structure to some initial hypersurface on which the initial Cauchy data for the colliding wave problem is specified.,8
222,To do this it is necessary to incorporate the properties of plane waves that have been described in Section 4.4 and illustrated in Figure 4.1.,8
223,", it must be noted that no global space-like hypersurface exists on which initial Cauchy data for the problem can be set.",8
224,The existence of the topological ‘fold’ singularities in regions II and III implies bounds for the initial Cauchy  hypersurface in both of the directions from which the waves emerge.,8
225,This property is illustrated in Figure 8.8.,8
226,"It can immediately be deduced from Figure 8.8 that, for solutions in which the curvature singularity in region IV is replaced by a Cauchy horizon, any possible extension through this horizon must be non-unique.",8
227,Any extended space-time beyond this singularity will depend on extra initial data that specified on the initial Cauchy hypersurface for the colliding wave problem.,8
228,"The above arguments lead to the conclusion that the usual initial data for colliding plane waves leads to a unique solution only up to the topological singularities  and  in regions II and III, and to the ‘focusing’ singularity  in the interaction region.",8
229,"This focusing singularity is normally a curvature singularity, but this may be replaced by a Cauchy horizon.",8
230,"In this case, any future extension through the horizon is non-unique.",8
231,THE SZEKERES CLASS OF VACUUM SOLUTIONS,8
232,The first exact solution to be published which describes a collision between plane waves was in fact that of Szekeres (1970).,8
233,This describes the collision of plane gravitational waves with step wavefronts.,8
234,"The solution discussed in Chapter 3, which describes the collision between impulsive gravitational waves, was published later by Khan and Penrose (1971).",8
235,"Following this, a substantial paper in which the subject is analysed in detail was produced by Szekeres (1972).",8
236,"This paper includes a derivation of the field equations in the form given in Chapter 6, a general class of exact solutions which includes the two mentioned above as special cases, and a discussion of the singularities that arise.",8
237,The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the properties of this general class of solutions.,8
238,The solution in region IV,8
239,The vacuum field equations appropriate to region IV of the colliding plane wave problem may be taken here in the form of equations (6.22a-f).,8
240,These are second order differential equations for the four metric functions .,8
241,"Equation (6.22a) may immediately be integrated as in (6.24) to give  (9.1) where  and  are arbitrary decreasing functions which, the appropriate boundary conditions (7.3), are required to satisfy  and .",8
242,"In the Szekeres class of solutions, the approaching waves have constant aligned polarization.",8
243,"In these solutions therefore  (9.2) and the main equations (6.22d, e) reduce to the single equation  (9.3) For this, Szekeres has obtained the solution  (9.4) which contains two arbitrary constants and .",8
244,The expression (9.4) may also be written in the alternative form  (9.5),8
245,"With this expression for , the remaining equations in (6.22) may be integrated to give  (9.6) where is a constant.",8
246,"As anticipated in the discussion in Section 7.2, it may be observed that this expression contains the necessary multiples of  and  that are required to cancel the effects of the unbounded term on the boundary.",8
247,"If the leading terms in the expansions for and are  (9.7) where , then is continuous across the boundaries if ,(9.8)",8
248,It may thus be observed that the constants and are restricted to the range satisfying  (9.9) It is also appropriate to choose  (9.10) to achieve the usual flat metric (3.6) in region I.,8
249,"When evaluating the components of the Weyl tensor, it is convenient to introduce the new function  (9.11)",8
250,"With this, it can be seen that  (9.12) and the non-zero Weyl tensor components are .",8
251,(9.13),8
252,"In his paper, Szekeres chooses  and  (9.14) exactly.",8
253,"In this case, the terms  and  in (9.6) exactly cancel the term , and is given by  (9.15)",8
254,"This form is still completely general since it has, in effect, simply used the coordinate freedom (6.7).",8
255,"However, it is sometimes convenient to retain this freedom, so this restriction will not be made in the following section.",8
256,"It may now be pointed out that, with the restriction (9.14), the above solution includes the Khan-Penrose (1971) solution for colliding impulsive waves when .",8
257,It also includes the Szekeres (1970) solution for colliding step waves when .,8
258,The approaching waves,8
259,"Having obtained an exact solution in region IV, the question now is to find the initial conditions which give rise to it.",8
260,"In fact, it is quite simple to use the method described in Section 7.2 to extend any solution in region IV back into regions II, III and I. We obtain the corresponding solutions in regions II and III simply by replacing by ½ and by ½ alternately.",8
261,"In this section we will concentrate on region II, and put .",8
262,"The equivalent solution in region III can be obtained from this by replacing by , and by interchanging and .",8
263,"Using the suggested method, it can be seen that the solution in region II must have the line element  (9.16) where, retaining the coordinate freedom in ,(9.17)",8
264,"to interpret this solution as a plane wave, it is appropriate to transform the metric to the Brinkmann form  (9.18) by putting  (9.19)",8
265,The wave profile in equation (9.18) now takes either of the forms  (9.20) or  (9.21) Particular cases in which  and  are illustrated in Figure 9.1 for .,8
266,Figure 9. l Some wave profiles for the approaching waves in the Szekeres solution with .,8
267,The wavefront is unbounded if .,8
268,"It contains a step if , and is smooth if .",8
269,All profiles become unbounded as approaches 1.,8
270,It may be recalled from (4.5) that .,8
271,"Thus, it can be clearly seen that the approaching gravitational wave in region II is an impulsive wave if , has an unbounded wavefront if , has a step wavefront if , has a continuous wavefront if , and has a smooth wavefront if .",8
272,"It may also be observed that, if , is monotonically increasing.",8
273,The singularity structure,8
274,"In this family of solutions, there is always a scalar polynomial curvature singularity in region IV on the surface on which .",8
275,"This can be seen by computing the scalar invariant given here by  (9.22) Using (9.6) and (9.13), I can be seen to be unbounded when  for all values of and in the required range (9.9).",8
276,"This is similar to the singularity in region IV of the Khan-Penrose solution which, , it includes as a special case.",8
277,Another singularity occurs in cases in which a wave with an unbounded wave front moves in a region where the opposing wave is non-zero.,8
278,", if  and  then I is unbounded on the boundary  between regions III and IV.",8
279,"Similarly, the boundary  is singular if  and  Apart from cases containing impulsive waves, where  or , the boundaries of region IV are therefore only regular if  for , which implies the further restriction  on (9.9).",8
280,"These singularities, however, are distribution-valued and their physical significance requires further investigation.",8
281,"The coordinate singularities in regions II and III, however, are not so obviously similar to the fold singularities of the Khan-Penrose solution.",8
282,The Szekeres solutions are only flat behind the wave front in the special case when .,8
283,"In the general case, regions II and III are curved and the analysis given in Section 8.2 cannot be applied.",8
284,"However, we may notice that in all cases with , 4 becomes unbounded as  in region II.",8
285,"This clearly indicates that, in these cases, the singularity in this region is a non-scalar curvature singularity.",8
286,This has been confirmed in rigorous calculations by Konkowski and Helliwell (1989).,8
287,It has also been argued in the previous chapter that these singularities have similar properties to the fold singularities that occur for colliding impulsive waves as described in Section 8.2 the behaviour of neighbouring geodesics.,8
288,"A similar non-scalar curvature singularity also occurs in region III if , as  then becomes unbounded as .",8
289,OTHER VACUUM SOLUTIONS WITH ALIGNED POLARIZATION,8
290,"The solutions of Khan and Penrose (1971) and of Szekeres (1970, 1972), discussed in Chapters 3 (and Section 8.2) and 9, describe the collision of plane gravitational waves with aligned linear polarization.",8
291,It is convenient to consider separately in this chapter a number of other exact solutions that satisfy this same condition.,8
292,A general method,8
293,"In situations in which the approaching waves are linearly polarized, and their polarization vectors are aligned, it is possible to put  globally.",8
294,"In this case the line element (6.20), and the field equations (6.22a-f) take a particularly simple form.",8
295,"Equation (6.22a) can immediately be integrated to give (6.24) and there is only one main equation, namely (9.3), which is a linear equation in .",8
296,"For any given solution of this equation, a function can always be found satisfying the remaining equations (6.22b, c, f), although such a function may not satisfy the required boundary conditions.",8
297,The integral (6.24) involves two continuous functions  and  that are monotonically decreasing for positive arguments.,8
298,"As suggested by Szekeres (1972), it is therefore possible to use these as coordinates in region IV, although care has to be taken at the boundaries and it is not possible to extend these coordinates into the prior regions II and III.",8
299,"Using (7.8), the line element in the interaction region can thus be written in the form  (10.1) and the main equation (9.3) becomes .",8
300,(10.2) which is the well-known Euler-Poisson-Darboux equation.,8
301,"For any particular solution of (10.2), the new function can be found by integrating equations (7.9), which now become  (10.3) for any particular solution to be appropriate to describe colliding plane waves, the function must satisfy the conditions described in equations (7.10) to (7.13).",8
302,"Using this notation, the components of the Weyl tensor are given by the expressions  (10.4) It can thus be seen that, although (10.2) is linear different solutions for can be superposed, the associated gravitational waves cannot be simply superposed.",8
303,", the scale factors and satisfying (6.13) and (6.14) must contain components of , and from (10.3) it can be seen that these components are also non-linear in .",8
304,"Once a solution of (10.2) and (10.3) describing the interaction region IV is obtained, the approaching waves in regions II and III can immediately be deduced.",8
305,", in region II, we simply put  and assume that takes the form .",8
306,"Then, removing the constant from , it is convenient to put  (10.5) and the approaching wave is then given by  (10.6) The approaching wave in region III is obtained in exactly the same way the function .",8
307,"to obtain exact solutions, the first step is to obtain a general class of solutions of (10.2).",8
308,"Szekeres (1972) has indicated how to integrate  this equation using Riemann's method, and has given a general solution expressed as a line integral involving a Legendre function of order -½.",8
309,This will be described in Chapter 14.,8
310,"However, because it is very difficult in practice to evaluate the integrals which this method involves, this does not turn out to be a convenient method for obtaining explicit solutions.",8
311,"As an alternative approach, it may be observed that attempting to solve equation (10.2) by separating the variables leads to the solution  (10.7) where and are arbitrary constants.",8
312,Thus a general class of solutions can be obtained by considering  (10.8) for arbitrary sequences of constants and .,8
313,"The particular decomposition (10.8), however, does not turn out to be particularly convenient in the construction of explicit solutions.",8
314,We will therefore proceed by changing the coordinates.,8
315,"Before introducing a new set of coordinates, it may be noted in passing that Feinstein and Ibañez (1989) have considered an alternative coordinate system and have expanded a general solution in a different way involving Bessel and Neumann functions of zero order.",8
316,Their approach will be described in Section 10.7.,8
317,The appropriate technique is to consider transformations of the basic functions and which are here treated as coordinates.,8
318,"It turns out to be convenient to put  (10.9) where ψ and λ are considered as time-like and space-like coordinates, which may then be rescaled by putting ,.",8
319,"(10.10) With this, it may be noted that  (10.11) and and can be expressed and by  (10.12) The boundaries of region IV are now the hypersurfaces on which , and the focusing hypersurface in this region occurs when .",8
320,"Thus, to correspond to the interaction region, the coordinates must satisfy the inequality .",8
321,"Using these coordinates, the main equation (10.2) becomes  (10.13)",8
322,A general class of solutions of (10.13) can now be obtained by considering variable separable solutions of the form .,8
323,"(10.14) With this,(10.13) reduces to the pair of Legendre equations  (10.15) and a class of solutions of (10.13) can be expressed as a sum of products  (10.16) where  and  are Legendre functions of the first and second kinds respectively, and ,,and are series of arbitrary constants.",8
324,", , Legendre functions of non-integer order may also be included.",8
325,"The Legendre functions of integer order are well known, but it may still be appropriate to note just the first few.",8
326,(10.17),8
327,"It may easily be shown that the solutions of Khan and Penrose, and of Szekeres are included in this class.",8
328,"The Khan-Penrose solution uses ,(10.18) and the Szekeres solution (9.4) generalizes this to  (10.19)",8
329,It may be noted that the Legendre functions of the second kind  are all singular when .,8
330,"The singularity  occurs when , and thus can be seen to be associated with the focusing singularity in region IV.",8
331,"In fact, to satisfy the boundary conditions, one Legendre function of the second kind must be included in the solution of (10.13).",8
332,"This may easily be demonstrated by substituting only the products of Legendre functions of the first kind into the condition (7.15), which can not then be satisfied.",8
333,Another solution of (10.13) can be obtained by considering separable solutions involving a sum the product (10.14).,8
334,This leads to the solution  (10.20) where is an arbitrary constant.,8
335,"This can immediately be seen to be the obvious solution  which, on its own, gives rise to the Kasner metrics as will be shown in the next section.",8
336,This term may be added to the sum (10.16).,8
337,"A further solution of (10.2), or (10.13) is given by  (10.21) where and are arbitrary constants.",8
338,In fact a series of solutions of this type can be used having different values of and .,8
339,Thus a different representation of the solution of (10.13) can be written in the form  (10.22),8
340,Alternatively terms from the sum (10.22) may also be added to those of (10.16).,8
341,"However, as will be shown in (10.68), some of these terms may also be expressed products of Legendre functions, and so are already included in (10.16).",8
342,It may be noted in passing that particular terms of this type have been included by Feinstein and Ibañez (1989) in the class of solutions that will be described in Section 10.7.,8
343,"Having obtained an expression for V as any combination of the terms (10.16),(10.20) and (10.22), it is then necessary to integrate (10.3) to  obtain .",8
344,These equations may conveniently be rewritten the coordinates and defined by (10.9) in the form .,8
345,"(10.23) However,is now so general that no complete integral for has yet been found.",8
346,"Instead, we proceed by discussing the particular cases that have been obtained.",8
347,The non-singular ‘solution’ of Stoyanov,8
348,We may now consider a paper of Stoyanov (1979) in which he claimed to have obtained a solution without singularities.,8
349,"His method was to look for a regular solution of the field equations in region IV, and then to obtain the global solution simply by requiring that the metric coefficients be continuous across the boundaries.",8
350,The solution he presented for region IV has the line element  (10.24) where is an arbitrary constant.,8
351,This clearly uses  (10.25) which does not satisfy the boundary conditions (7.3) which require that and must be smooth functions.,8
352,"In fact, it has been shown by Nutku (1981) that the discontinuities in the derivatives of and on the boundaries of region IV indicate the presence of an infinite discontinuity in the Ricci tensor on these hypersurfaces.",8
353,"Thus, although (10.24) is a vacuum solution inside region IV, it cannot be a global vacuum solution describing the collision of purely gravitational waves.",8
354,"It may also be observed that, with the positive signs in (10.24) and (10.25),and are increasing functions that are inconsistent with (7.13).",8
355,Such a possibility can only arise if the impulsive components of the matter tensor  on the boundary of region IV have negative energy density.,8
356,It is in this way that the singularity has been removed.,8
357,It is only with the possibility of the presence of matter with negative energy density that the focusing effect of colliding waves can be avoided.,8
358,Nutku (1981) also pointed out that the line element (10.24) is the well known cosmological solution of Kasner (1921).,8
359,"He gave the explicit coordinate transformation by which the line element (10.24) becomes ,(10.26) where the coordinate is not the same as that used elsewhere in this chapter, and  (10.27) which clearly satisfies the necessary conditions .",8
360,(10.28),8
361,The Stoyanov solution has been obtained with the solution of (9.3) given by  (10.29) which is the solution (10.20).,8
362,"With this, the remaining equations in (6.22) may be integrated to give  (10.30) which clearly cannot be continuous across the boundaries of region IV if the junction conditions (7.3) are satisfied.",8
363,It must be concluded that the above solution cannot be interpreted an interaction between plane gravitational waves.,8
364,"Certainly, it is not a counterexample of a solution for colliding waves without singularity.",8
365,"However, in region IV, it is the well known Kasner solution which features regularly in discussions of solution generating techniques.",8
366,"In fact, it turns out that this solution can be used as a ‘seed’ from which other physically acceptable solutions may be derived.",8
367,It will therefore be referred to again in later sections.,8
368,"This solution in the case when  has been further investigated by Taub (1988 ), looking particularly at the properties of the distribution valued curvature tensor.",8
369,The solution of Ferrari and Ibañez and Griffiths,8
370,"Now consider the case with the solution of (10.11) given by  (10.31) This solution was first presented by Ferrari and Ibañez (1986,1987 ) in the case when  and .",8
371,The solution with general parameters was published by Griffiths (1987).,8
372,"The Ferrari-Ibañez (1986,1987 ) solution can be seen to be a modification of the Khan-Penrose solution, while the more general case is a generalization of the Szekeres solution (10.19) with .",8
373,"With the solution (10.31), the remaining equations (10.23) may be integrated to give .",8
374,(10.32),8
375,"It may be noticed that contains the term  (10.33) which includes the terms (7.10) that, with (7.8), are required to ensure that  is continuous across the boundaries of region IV.",8
376,"If the leading terms in the power series for and take the form ,(10.34) then the required boundary conditions are satisfied if .",8
377,(10.35),8
378,Figure 10.1 Wave profiles of approaching waves in the Ferrari Ibañez-Griffiths solution with .,8
379,"These have been obtained from (10.6), but the scale factor contained in the bounded part of has been removed.",8
380,"Profiles are shown for the special cases in which  or , when the wave front is continuous.",8
381,The more general situation is represented by the cases in which takes the values 1 and -2.,8
382,"By extending this solution into regions II and III and putting , it can be seen from (10.6) that the approaching waves contain an impulsive wave component  only if  and .",8
383,"This case includes the Khan-Penrose solution for which  and the Ferrari-Ibañez (1987 ) solution in which ,.",8
384,"However, with , the impulsive wave is followed by another wave component.",8
385,Some profiles for approaching waves of this type are illustrated in Figure 10.1.,8
386,"It can also be shown using (10.6) that the wave front of the approaching wave in region II behaves as  (10.36) Thus, unless , the wave front may have a distributional amplitude.",8
387,It is unbounded if  and has a step if .,8
388,The wave front is smooth if .,8
389,"Scaled profiles for the approaching waves are illustrated in Figure 10.2 for some particular values of and with equal to 4, 6 and 8.",8
390,"In all cases the approaching waves become unbounded as  in region II, and as  in region III.",8
391,"Figure 10.2 Scaled wave profiles of approaching waves in the Ferrari-Ibañez-Griffiths solution for various values of and , and with taking the values 4, 6 and 8.",8
392,It can also be shown that this family of solutions has the same singularity structure as the class of Szekeres solutions as described in Section 9.3 and to which it reduces when .,8
393,"In region IV, there is a scalar polynomial curvature singularity on the space-like surface  on which  and .",8
394,"It may be noted that when , the initial boundaries  and  of region IV contain a distribution-valued singularity.",8
395,These initial boundaries are regular when .,8
396,"As in all other solutions, it may also be noted that there are non-scalar curvature  singularities in the initial regions II and III on the hypersurfaces on which  and  respectively",8
397,The soliton solution of Ferrari and Ibañez,8
398,Ferrari and Ibañez (1987 ) have also used a generating that is familiar in the study of solitons to obtain a solution of (10.2) in which  (10.37) where  and a is an arbitrary constant.,8
399,This was initially obtained using the inverse scattering technique in which the initial ‘seed’ solution is taken to be the Kasner or Stoyanov solution given by (10.20) or (10.29).,8
400,This solution can immediately be seen to be a generalization of the Khan-Penrose solution (10.18) by the addition of the solution (10.20).,8
401,It necessarily contains impulsive wave components.,8
402,"It was pointed out by Griffiths (1987), however, that this solution may easily be generalized by treating the parameter k in (10.36) as another arbitrary constant.",8
403,"In this way, this family of solutions may also be considered to be a generalization of the Szekeres solutions with .",8
404,"As in the previous example, this generalization then permits the approaching waves to have a continuous wave front for appropriate values of and .",8
405,It is this more general class of solutions that is considered in this section.,8
406,It is possible immediately to integrate equations (10.23) to obtain .,8
407,(10.38),8
408,"This contains the term  which, as in (10.33), is required to ensure that is continuous across the boundaries of region IV.",8
409,"If the leading terms in the power series for and take the form ,(10.39) then the required boundary conditions are satisfied if .",8
410,(10.40) In this case it is remarkable that the junction conditions place no constraint on the parameter .,8
411,"This feature is, in fact, related to a general result that will be described in Section 12.1.",8
412,"When evaluating expressions for the Weyl tensor, it is convenient to use the coordinates and defined by (10.10)(it may be noticed that these differ from those used by Ferrari and Ibañez).",8
413,"The scale-invariant components of the Weyl tensor are given by  (10.41) For the sake of later discussion, it is found to be appropriate to choose the scale functions and defined by (6.2) and (6.14) to be  (10.42) The negative signs are the signs of and .",8
414,"From (10.41) it can be seen that, , this solution has the same singularity structure as the Szekeres solution.",8
415,There is a curvature singularity on the hypersurface given by  or .,8
416,"There are, however, exceptional cases which occur when  and  .",8
417,In these cases  (10.43) which satisfies the condition  (10.44) which implies that the space-time is of algebraic type D (see Kramer et .,8
418,"1980, or Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos 1986 ).",8
419,These particular degenerate cases will be analysed in more detail in the next section.,8
420,"When  and , the approaching waves contain an impulsive component.",8
421,"For ,, the null boundaries of region IV contain distribution-valued singularities.",8
422,"These boundaries are regular when ,.",8
423,"The approaching waves have a step wavefront if , and the wavefront is continuous if .",8
424,"Also, as in the Szekeres solutions, there are non-scalar curvature singularities in regions II and III when  and  respectively, for all values of a and all permissible values of .",8
425,A generalization of the class of solutions described in this section has been obtained by Tsoubelis and Wang (1989).,8
426,This has been obtained by putting .,8
427,"(10.45) By a comparison with (10.37) and (10.19), this can be seen to be a generalization both of the above Ferrari Ibañez solution and also of the Szekeres class of solutions described in Chapter 9.",8
428,"Its properties can reasonably be inferred from those of these two subclasses, as has been confirmed by Tsoubelis and Wang.",8
429,The degenerate Ferrari-Ibañez solutions,8
430,"Consider now the special cases of the above Ferrari-Ibañez solution in which  and , in which the Weyl tensor components are given by (10.43).",8
431,The properties of these cases have been further described by Ferrari and Ibañez (1988).,8
432,"In the case when ,, there is again a curvature singularity when .",8
433,"However, when  and , the space-time appears to be regular for all , and the singularity caused by the mutual focusing of the two waves appears to have been removed.",8
434,"It is, therefore, appropriate to consider this particular case in more detail.",8
435,"Since  in these cases, it is possible to scale the null coordinates .",8
436,(10.46),8
437,"When , the metric functions in region IV are then given by  (10.47) and the Weyl tensor components are then given by  (10.48) As expected, these indicate that the approaching waves are impulses followed by continuous components.",8
438,"Of greater significance, however, is the fact that in this case there are two point singularities at the points , and ,.",8
439,The existence of the singularities at these points implies that the lines  and  in regions II and III act as ‘fold singularities’ like those described in Section 8.2.,8
440,These lines therefore form boundaries to the space-time in these regions.,8
441,It is convenient now to return to the time-like and space-like coordinates ψ and λ.,8
442,In the degenerate case when  the line element in the interaction region takes the form .,8
443,(10.49),8
444,"To analyse this particular case further, consider the change of variables .",8
445,(10.50),8
446,"With this, the line element (10.49) takes the form  (10.51) which may immediately be recognized as the Schwarzschild metric with .,",8
447,"With , however, we have  which is normally understood as the region inside the horizon.",8
448,", since increases from zero in the interaction region, this region must correspond to the part of the Schwarzschild space-time indicated in Figure 10.3(b) which is inside the initial horizon.",8
449,"However, it may also be noticed that the coordinate which represents the axial coordinate in the Schwarzschild solution covers the entire range  in this case.",8
450,Figure 10.3 The interaction region of the degenerate solution viewed in two different coordinate planes.,8
451,"The plane (a) is the ,or  plane as in previous figures.",8
452,Diagram (b) represents the  plane and is equivalent to the familiar Kruskal-Szekeres diagram for the Schwarzschild space-time.,8
453,"From Figure 10.3, it appears that the approaching waves collide at the surface  and reach a horizon at .",8
454,"There is, however, no reason why the coordinate should not be continued ",8
455,"If such a continuation is possible, this would indicate that the waves would continue through the horizon until they finally end in a curvature singularity at .",8
456,"The other degenerate case in which  can also be transformed to a Schwarzschild space-time but, in this case, the interaction region corresponds to the upper region inside the horizon and all trajectories end in the future singularity.",8
457,"This case, together with the above transformation, has also been described by Yurtsever (1988 ).",8
458,It is instructive also to express the metric in Kruskal-Szekeres form.,8
459,This can be achieved from (10.49) using the transformation  (10.52) where and are null coordinates in the  plane.,8
460,"With this, the line element becomes  (10.53) where ψ is given by .",8
461,(10.54),8
462,In these coordinates the structure of the solution in the vicinity of the horizon is clearly shown to be regular.,8
463,"It is also convenient to consider this solution alternative null coordinates and , in the interaction region  (10.55) where the new constants and are the strengths of the approaching gravitational shock waves.",8
464,"With these coordinates it can be seen that the Schwarzschild mass parameter, which is unity in the line elements (10.51) and (10.53), is here related to the amplitudes of the approaching waves by .",8
465,(10.56),8
466,It follows from this that stronger approaching gravitational waves would produce a shorter proper time between the collision and the subsequent horizon.,8
467,"They would also give rise to a smaller Schwarzschild mass parameter, and hence greater curvature on the horizon.",8
468,"When trying to relate the global structure of this solution to part of the Schwarzschild space-time, it should be emphasised that for this class of colliding plane waves the coordinate is not periodic but covers the full range .",8
469,Topological singularities occur on the lines  and  on the horizon  (or ).,8
470,This global structure of the solution has been determined by Hayward (1989 ).,8
471,He has noted that the above solution also forms a covering space of part of the Schwarzschild white hole with a quasiregular covering space singularity along the polar axis around which the space-time is wound.,8
472,He has also suggested an alternative extension of the Schwarzschild exterior inside the black hole.,8
473,", he has suggested some possible extensions for the non-unique region beyond the horizon including one that is time symmetric.",8
474," to Figure 10.3(b), the opposing waves in this case collide on the hypersurface .",8
475,"The interaction region is then that part of the Schwarzschild space-time inside the initial horizon as indicated, which extends to the horizon as the focusing hypersurface.",8
476,An extension through this surface may be taken to be the familiar two parts of the exterior Schwarzschild space-time.,8
477,This can be continued to the subsequent horizon.,8
478,A further extension through this horizon is then possible the next surface on which  or  at which the space-time again splits into two separating gravitational waves which are the time reverse of the initial approaching waves.,8
479,"At the conclusion of this section, it may be noted that Ferrari and Ibañez (1988) have shown that the shear-free principal null congruences associated with this type D space-time do not focus on the horizon.",8
480,"However, these congruences are in different planes from the congruences on which the two wave components propagate, and for which the contraction and shear clearly become unbounded as .",8
481,An odd order solution,8
482,All of the solutions considered so far have involved only Legendre  of even order.,8
483,A solution with odd order functions has been presented by Griffiths (1987).,8
484,This has .,8
485,"(10.57) With this function, equations (10.23) can immediately be integrated to give .",8
486,(10.58),8
487,"As in (10.32–34), it can be clearly seen that this expression contains terms of the form (7.10).",8
488,"It may thus be concluded that, if the leading terms in the expansions for the functions f and g are given by (10.34), then the boundary conditions that are required for the solution to describe colliding plane waves are satisfied if .",8
489,(10.59),8
490,"As in previous examples, it can be shown that the approaching waves have an impulsive component if .",8
491,"Also the wavefront is unbounded if , has a step if , is continuous but not smooth if , and is smooth if .",8
492,"The expressions for the Weyl tensor components are rather complicated, and there is nothing particularly remarkable about this solution.",8
493,"In the previous examples discussed in this chapter, the two waves approaching are identical.",8
494,The component 0 in region III has an identical form to 4 in region II but with the null coordinate replacing.,8
495,"Similarly, the expressions for in the two regions can be related by the same replacement.",8
496,"In this case, however, since odd functions are being used, a change of sign is also included.",8
497,"Thus, and  in region II are replaced by  and  in region III.",8
498,"The approaching waves still have colinear polarization but, in this case, their amplitudes are opposite the same.",8
499,The second Yurtsever and the Feinstein-Ibañez solutions,8
500,"For colliding plane wave solutions, we are considering space-times with two space-like Killing vectors.",8
501,"Such space-times have also been considered in the context of cosmology, where certain vacuum inhomogeneous cosmologies satisfy the same field equations as the interaction region for colliding colinear gravitational waves (Gowdy 1971), although different boundary conditions are appropriate.",8
502,In fact the vacuum Gowdy cosmologies can be considered to represent closed universes built from opposing plane gravitational waves.,8
503,"The similarity between these solutions  has been noted by Feinstein and Ibañez (1989), who have used known cosmological solutions to obtain a new class of colliding plane wave solutions.",8
504,"In this section, the Feinstein Ibañez solutions are presented.",8
505,The electromagnetic Gowdy cosmologies will be described in Section 17.3.,8
506,It is appropriate at this point to consider the alternative system of coordinates defined by .,8
507,"(10.60) It may be noted that the new coordinate is a decreasing, or past pointing, time-like coordinate, and that the singularity in region IV occurs when .",8
508,These coordinates have also been used by Yurtsever (1988 ).,8
509,"In this case, the line element (10.1) for colliding waves with aligned constant polarization can be rewritten in the diagonal form  (10.61) and the main vacuum field equation (9.3),(10.2) or (10.13) becomes  (10.62) and the subsidiary equations (10.3) become  (10.63) where the dot and prime denote derivatives and respectively.",8
510,"The above equations (10.62,63) are exactly those for the vacuum Gowdy cosmologies that have been considered by many authors.",8
511,The general solution of (10.62) can be expressed as a line integral.,8
512,"However, for the class of Gowdy cosmologies, it is found to be convenient to consider the class of solutions given by  (10.64) where  and  are arbitrary linear combinations of the terms in curly brackets, including the Fourier-Bessel integrals of the form  (10.65) and  are Bessel functions of the first and second kinds of zero order, and  and  are sets of arbitrary constants.",8
513,The first term in (10.64) is clearly identical to the solution (10.20).,8
514,"It is the term that, on its own, gives rise to the Kasner solutions.",8
515,The set of terms included in have regular behaviour as .,8
516,It may be noted that this property is also shared by the combination of terms  that are contained in (10.16).,8
517,"The set of terms included in , however, are badly behaved as .",8
518,These are the terms that are considered to induce chaotic behaviour in these cosmological models.,8
519,The last term in (10.64) is identical to (10.31).,8
520,This contains the so-called gravitational soliton components.,8
521,"Yurtsever (1988 ) has considered the asymptotic structure of those solutions which only contain the combinations  and , i.e. in which .",8
522,He has shown that these solutions are asymptotic to the inhomogeneous Kasner solutions as the singularity  is approached.,8
523,He has also given explicit expressions which relate the asymptotic Kasner exponents along the singularity to the initial data specified along the wave fronts of the incoming colliding plane waves.,8
524,It follows from this analysis that the focusing hypersurface  is a curvature singularity except in the special case in which one of the Kasner exponents is zero.,8
525,"This special case of the degenerate Kasner solution is flat and, in this case, the focusing hypersurface is a Killing-Cauchy horizon across which space-time can be extended.",8
526,"It is reasonable to conclude from this that, although there are colliding plane wave space-times which contain a Killing-Cauchy horizon a space-like curvature singularity, these space-times are unstable against small perturbations of the initial data and that ‘generic’ initial data always produce space-like curvature singularities.",8
527,Feinstein and Ibañez (1989) have considered the family of solutions for which the combination is zero.,8
528,"They have shown that, for this case, a curvature singularity does not develop in region IV as  provided that .",8
529,"(10.66) They have also shown that, in this case, the necessary boundary conditions (7.15) are satisfied provided there are two solitonic terms  with constants satisfying  (10.67) using the notation of (7.11).",8
530,(The unfortunate repeated use of constants and in this equation should not cause confusion.),8
531,It may thus be noted that these two solitonic terms provide the conditions for continuity on the two different null boundaries of region IV.,8
532,"For continuity it is also required that  and , so and are constrained to the range .",8
533,"(10.68) It follows from this and (10.66) that , and so the first term in (10.64) must necessarily be included in these solutions.",8
534,"It may also be noted that the solutions given in the notation of previous sections by  (10.69) where and are given by (10.67), similarly do not contain curvature singularities on the hypersurface  provided the constants and are constrained by (10.66) and (10.68).",8
535,It is also of interest to note that the two solitonic terms that provide the continuity across the boundaries of the interaction region are in fact identical to the two separate terms in the Szekeres solution (9.4).,8
536,This may be observed by noting that  (10.70) and similarly .,8
537,(10.71),8
538,"It follows from this that even the Szekeres solution, which is everywhere , can be adapted by the inclusion of a suitable multiple of the term (10.20) to provide a solution without a curvature singularity in the interaction region.",8
539,"Thus, the occurrence of a quasiregular singularity in region IV can have nothing to do with the relaxation of the continuity conditions across the boundaries.",8
540,The class of solutions included here contain an arbitrary number of parameters.,8
541,It can be shown that they are algebraically general in the interaction region.,8
542,"They contain the usual coordinate singularity on the hypersurface  but, for this class, this is not a curvature singularity.",8
543,Feinstein and Ibañez have shown that the solution is extendable across this surface.,8
544,"However, the extension is not unique.",8
545,The first Yurtsever solutions,8
546,"For colliding plane waves with aligned linear polarization, it has been seen that the main field equation (10.2) is linear.",8
547,Various classes of solutions have already been obtained by separating the variables of this equation in a number of different ways.,8
548,A further class of solutions in which the main equation is separated in yet another way has been given by Yurtsever (1988 ).,8
549,These solutions were originally obtained indirectly by first considering the Weyl solutions for stationary axisymmetric space-times.,8
550,"However, they will be presented here in a more general way that is also more appropriate in considering colliding wave solutions.",8
551,"It is appropriate here to start with the main equation in the form (10.62) using the variables and defined by (10.60), and then transforming it by putting  (10.72) where the parameters and η are not necessarily real.",8
552,"Indeed, real values of these variables only cover part of the interaction region as will be clarified later.",8
553,"With these parameters, the main equation (10.62) becomes  (10.73) and this has a series of separable solutions of the form  (10.74) where  and  are Legendre functions of the first and second kinds.",8
554,"Figure 10.4 In the interaction region IV for the Yurtsever solutions, the variables and cosh η are imaginary in the initial region marked A that immediately follows the collision.",8
555,This region is followed by the regions marked B in which these variables are real.,8
556,We must now reconsider the parameters of these solutions.,8
557,"As defined by (10.72),and  are imaginary when the product is positive.",8
558,"Since both and decrease from ½ towards -½ in the interaction region, it is appropriate to divide this region into the subregions A and B in which the product is positive and negative respectively as indicated in Figure 10.4.",8
559,Explicitly we may put  (10.75),8
560,It is clear that is zero midway along the two boundaries between region IV and regions II and III.,8
561,The inverse functions of that appear in (10.74) must therefore be excluded for colliding plane wave solutions since they must be regular along these boundaries.,8
562,It is therefore appropriate to express general solutions in the form  (10.76) This solution will simply be quoted in the second form since either equation formally includes the other.,8
563,"It may be noted that these solutions are continuous on the boundaries between the subregions A and B. Also, the terms involving the Legendre functions of the first kind are regular on the focusing hypersurface , while those involving the Legendre functions of the second kind are singular on this surface.",8
564,"To be precise, in the original class of solutions given by Yurtsever (1988 ),is taken in the form  (10.77) which can be seen to be generalizations of the degenerate Ferrari-Ibañez solution described in Section 10.5.",8
565,"They are therefore distortions of the Schwarzschild black hole solution in the interaction region, and correspond to interior Weyl solutions for static axisymmetric space-times.",8
566,"colliding plane waves, these solutions all involve approaching waves with initial impulsive components.",8
567,Some particular examples have been described explicitly by Yurtsever (1988 ).,8
568,Clearly these solutions can easily be generalised by modifying the coefficients of the first terms of (10.77).,8
569,"By choosing these appropriately, it is possible to remove the impulsive components from the approaching waves.",8
570,Further explicit solutions,8
571,"To obtain solutions describing the collision and interaction of plane waves with aligned linear polarization it is necessary first to solve the main field equation, which may be expressed different coordinates in any of the forms (9.3),(10.2),(10.13),(10.62) or (10.73).",8
572,"Any number of further explicit solutions may easily be generated using the methods described in the previous sections of this chapter with different combinations of particular solutions of the main equation (9.3),(10.2),(10.13),(10.62) or (10.73).",8
573,It is appropriate here simply to list the various possibilities.,8
574,First there are the solutions (10.16) which have been obtained by separating the variables in (10.13).,8
575,"These involve Legendre functions of the first and second kinds  (10.78) where ,,and are series of arbitrary constants.",8
576,"It may be noted, , that non-integer values of may also be included.",8
577,"There are also the particular solutions (10.20),(10.8) and (10.22) that can be re-expressed in the form  (10.79) where  are arbitrary constants.",8
578,"Then there are the solutions of (10.62) that are contained in (10.64) and have previously been included in Gowdy cosmologies, namely  (10.80) where  and ) are Bessel functions of the first and second kinds of zero order,,, and  are sets of arbitrary constants.",8
579,"It may be noted that the solutions (10.80) have been obtained by separating the variables in (10.62), taking only solutions that are periodic in .",8
580,This constraint is not required for colliding plane waves and an additional set of aperiodic solutions is given by  (10.81) where  and  are modified Bessel functions of the first and second kinds of zero order.,8
581,"Finally, there are the separable solutions of (10.73) which are non-singular on the initial boundaries, namely  (10.82) which again involve Legendre functions of the first and second kind.",8
582,"When considered as infinite series, these different forms may simply be regarded as different representations of the same class of solutions.",8
583,"However, when looking for particular explicit solutions it is necessary to consider only a few terms.",8
584,"In this way, further exact solutions for colliding plane waves may be obtained by combining particular components from  any of the series V1, V2, V3, V4 and V5 and by choosing the arbitrary constants (10.83) where and are constrained to the range (7.13).",8
585,"If this condition is satisfied, then it remains only to integrate the subsidiary equations in the form (10.3) or (10.63) to obtain the remaining metric function or .",8
586,ERNST EQUATION FOR COLLIDING GRAVITATIONAL WAVES,8
587,The solutions being considered here for colliding plane waves all have a pair of commuting Killing vectors that are assumed to exist globally.,8
588,"It may therefore be expected that the solutions obtained may be related to known cylindrically symmetric solutions, or to stationary axisymmetric solutions, which similarly have a pair of Killing vectors.",8
589,"Such a relation was first pointed out by Kinnersley (1975), and by Fisher (1980).",8
590,"The exact relation between these solutions has been established more recently by Chandrasekhar and Ferrari (1984), and Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1985 ), and exploited by these authors and their colleagues.",8
591,In this chapter we will present an analysis of the colliding wave problem using a method that has become familiar in the study of stationary axisymmetric space-times.,8
592,In this case the field is described a complex potential function that is referred to as the Ernst potential (see Ernst 1968 ).,8
593,This approach leads directly to various methods for generating further exact solutions.,8
594,A derivation of the Ernst equation,8
595,"First it may be recalled that, of the vacuum field equations (6.22a-f) considered in previous chapters,(6.22a) may immediately be integrated to give ,(11.1) and (6.22d, e) are integrability conditions for the remaining equations.",8
596,Attention is thus focused on these main equations for the metric functions  and .,8
597,"It is now appropriate to consider a different combination of these functions, by putting  (11.2) or, inversely .",8
598,"(11.3) This modifies the form of the line element (6.20), which now becomes .",8
599,(11.4),8
600,It is also convenient to introduce the complex function .,8
601,"(11.5) With this, the line element (11.4) can be written in the form  (11.6) and the two main equations (6.22d, e) can be written as the single complex equation  (11.7) It may be seen that this is in fact Ernst's equation, which can be written in the coordinate-invariant form  (11.8) where  is the square of the gradient of an arbitrary scalar field which, in this case, is a function of the two (null) coordinates only.",8
602,"Similarly, v2 is the 3+1-dimensional Laplacian operator (or the generalized d'Alembertian) given by .",8
603,(11.9),8
604,"Using the above notation, the non-zero components of the Weyl tensor given by (6.23) can be written as  (11 10)",8
605,"When considering Ernst's equation, it is frequently found to be useful also to introduce an associated function Ε, defined by  (11.11) With this, the line element (11.4) or (11.6) can be written in the alternative form  (11.12) and the main equations (6.22d, e), or alternatively (11.7), become .",8
606,(11.13) This is the alternative form of the Ernst equation and may be rewritten in the coordinate-invariant form .,8
607,(11.14),8
608,"Using this function, the non-zero components of the Weyl tensor (11.10) can be written as  (11.1)",8
609,The problem now involves finding appropriate solutions of (11.7) or (11.13).,8
610,"These equations, however, contain the derivatives of , and hence they depend on the arbitrary functions and that are specified by the incoming waves.",8
611,This apparently explicit dependence on initial conditions may in fact be removed by adapting the coordinate system of Chandrasekhar and Ferrari (1984).,8
612,"Here we again use (10.9–12) and put  (11.16) where ψ and λ are considered as time-like and space-like coordinates, which may then be rescaled by putting .",8
613,"(11.17) In this coordinate system, equation (11.7) takes the more familiar explicit form of Ernst's equation:(11.18) and (11.13) similarly becomes  (11.19) The intermediate steps in the derivation of these equations may be deduced from (16.6) and (16.11).",8
614,See also (12.30–31).,8
615,"It may be noticed that, in this case, the solution of these equations immediately determines some of the metric functions.",8
616,"This is in marked contrast to their application in stationary axisymmetric space-times, where the Ernst equation only determines potentials for the fields.",8
617,"The original metric functions, as considered in previous chapters, are now given by  (11.20)",8
618,Boundary conditions,8
619,"When looking for solutions of the Ernst equation for stationary axisymmetric space-times, it is appropriate to require that solutions be asymptotically flat.",8
620,"However, for colliding plane waves very different boundary conditions apply.",8
621,"For colliding plane waves it is necessary to choose or Ε, and hence and , the solution of (6.22b, c, f) for is continuous across the boundaries of region IV.",8
622,"For vacuum solutions, it is appropriate to use (7.8) and equations (7.9) may then be written in the form .",8
623,"To ensure that the boundary conditions are satisfied, it is then essential that the solution of these equations should include the necessary components (7.10).",8
624,"In this approach, solutions in the interaction region for  or  are related to the functions  and , and hence may be obtained as a function of and .",8
625,"The boundary conditions described in Chapter 7 may then be considered to place restrictions on the structure of these functions, which characterize the approaching waves.",8
626,"In practice, these boundary conditions are difficult to apply, basically because the condition that be continuous is only indirectly applied to the functions and , or , or , that feature in the main equations.",8
627,It is therefore often convenient to apply the boundary condition in the form (7.15) or (7.16).,8
628,"Writing , this becomes  This form is particularly convenient when , which occurs when impulsive waves are present.",8
629,"The boundary conditions in this limited case only, have been discussed by Ernst, García-Díaz and Hauser (1987 ).",8
630,"the functions and , the conditions (11.22) become  where and must satisfy the inequalities (7.13).",8
631,"Alternatively, writing , the boundary conditions require that   which, the functions and become  (11.26)",8
632,"Finally, it is convenient to express the boundary conditions the variables and .",8
633,"These become, for ,(11.27) where and satisfy (7.13).",8
634,Colinear solutions,8
635,"In the next chapter, the approach described above will be used to derive new solutions for colliding gravitational waves whose polarization vectors are not aligned.",8
636,"Such solutions essentially have non-zero, and hence and Ε are complex.",8
637,"However, before moving on to consider such cases, it is appropriate first to review the colinear solutions described in previous chapters.",8
638,These solutions have and Ε real.,8
639,"The solution of Khan and Penrose (1971), discussed in Chapter 3 and Section 8.2, which describes the collision of aligned impulsive gravitational waves, is given by .",8
640,(11.28) In this case  and .,8
641,"It may be observed that, for stationary axisymmetric space-times,(11.28) is the Ernst potential which leads to the Schwarzschild solution.",8
642,"The Szekeres (1972) class of solutions, described in Chapter 9, is given by .",8
643,"(11.29) In this case  and , with  for  and .",8
644,The ‘solution’ of Stoyanov (1979) given by (10.24) uses .,8
645,"(11.30) In Section 10.2 it has been argued that this solution must be considered to be unphysical on its own, but it may be included as a factor in more general solutions.",8
646,It does not satisfy the boundary conditions (11.26).,8
647,"The solution of Ferrari and Ibañez (1987 ) and Griffiths (1987), which is described in Section 10.3, is characterized by  where  (11.31) In this case  and , where  and .",8
648,"It may be observed that, when ,(11.31) is the Ernst potential which, for stationary axisymmetric solutions, leads to the solution of Erez and Rosen (1959) which describes the external field of a non-rotating body with a quadrupole moment.",8
649,"The generalized solution of Ferrari and Ibañez (1987 ), described in Section 10.4, is characterized by .",8
650,"(11.32) This can be seen to include the Stoyanov factor (11.30), and to reduce to a Szekeres solution with  when .",8
651,Again  and  where  and .,8
652,The degenerate cases occur when .,8
653,"The solution of Tsoubelis and Wang (1989) given by (10.44) has  (11.33) This can be seen to be a generalization of (11.29) and (11.32), and its properties can immediately be deduced.",8
654,"The odd order solution of Griffiths (1987) described in Section 10.6 uses the Ernst potential , where  (11.34) Again  and , where  and .",8
655,It is not difficult to see how further solutions of this type can be generated.,8
656,SOLUTION-GENERATING TECHNIQUES,8
657,For stationary axisymmetric space-times many solution-generating techniques are known.,8
658,"These are associated with the two Killing vectors, and with the internal symmetries of the Ernst equation.",8
659,"Colliding plane wave solutions also have two Killing vectors, and the main field equations can be transformed exactly to the Ernst equation.",8
660,The main difference is that the solutions of the Ernst equation now contain the metric functions explicitly the field potentials as in the stationary axisymmetric case.,8
661,"It is therefore to be expected that many of the familiar solution generating techniques can be used to obtain new colliding plane wave solutions from already known, or ‘seed’, solutions.",8
662,In this chapter we will consider only vacuum solutions.,8
663,This will enable us to continue to concentrate on the collision of gravitational waves.,8
664,"Various techniques will be discussed here, and the main solutions that have been obtained using them will be described in the next chapter.",8
665,"Many techniques are also known by which solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations, and other non-vacuum solutions, can be generated from known vacuum solutions.",8
666,These will be discussed later in Chapter 15.,8
667,The colinear case,8
668,Consider first the case when the approaching waves have colinear polarization.,8
669,The metric can be taken in the form of the line element (6.20) with .,8
670,"In this case, given any solution  of the field equations (6.22), then another solution of the same equations again with  is given by ,and , where  (12.1) where is an arbitrary constant.",8
671,"This transformation is well known (Halilsoy, 1985).",8
672,"It can clearly be seen that, if the initial solution satisfies the boundary conditions appropriate for colliding waves, then so does the new solution.",8
673,It can also  be seen that the transformation (12.1) is equivalent to adding to V the Stoyanov solution (10.29).,8
674,"It may also be observed that the transformation (12.1) can be used to obtain the soliton solution of Ferrari and Ibañez (1987 ) described in Section 10.4, using as seed the Khan Penrose solution.",8
675,"Ferrari and Ibañez, however, originally obtained their solution using the soliton techniques mentioned in Section 12.6.",8
676,"Another transformation which maps one colinear solution of (6.22) on another, they satisfy the boundary conditions, is given by  (12.2) where is an arbitrary constant and .",8
677,"When , it can be seen that the transformation (12.2) is singular on the boundaries of the interaction region where  and .",8
678,"It follows that the necessary boundary conditions cannot be satisfied for both solutions, if the same expressions for and are used.",8
679,"If the seed solution satisfies the boundary conditions as described in Chapter 7, with  and containing the terms  (12.3) with  (12.4) then the new solution containing the terms (7.10) will also satisfy the boundary conditions if and are replaced by  (12.5) where  (12.6) provided  and .",8
680,These equations give the new expression for the null coordinates and .,8
681,It may be noted that the inequalities (12.6) provide strong constraints on the range of permissible values of the parameter in (12.2).,8
682,It can thus be seen that this transformation with  may be used to change the profile of the approaching waves.,8
683,", it could  be used to derive the Szekeres solution described in Chapter 9 from the Khan-Penrose solution.",8
684,The two transformations (12.1) and (12.2) may also be used in conjunction.,8
685,"It may also be noted that the transformations for in (12.1) and (12.2) may be restated in the form that, if a real is a solution of Ernst's equation (11.18), then  (12.7) and  (12.8) are also real solutions with arbitrary constants and , though as explained above, the possible values of are constrained by the boundary conditions.",8
686,"These results are, , implicitly contained in the general approach to colinear solutions described in Section 10.1.",8
687,"The point to note is that, when the approaching waves have constant aligned polarization and Ε are real and , the main field equations can be linearized.",8
688,"In this case a general superposition of solutions is possible, as illustrated in (10.16) together with (10.20).",8
689,Further generating techniques for this case have been described by Kitchingham (1984).,8
690,"In the more general case, however,and Ε are complex, and the field equations are essentially non-linear.",8
691,"In this situation, the generating techniques described in the remainder of this chapter are particularly significant.",8
692,Rotations and Ehlers transformations,8
693,"Consider first the well known result that, if is a solution of Ernst's equation (11.14), then  (12.9) where is a constant, is also a solution.",8
694,"the alternative function Z the equivalent result is that, if is a solution of (11.8), then another solution is given by  (12.10)",8
695,"By applying the coordinate rotation  (12.11) to the line element (11.12), it may be shown that this rotation is exactly equivalent to the transformation (12.9), indicating that this transformation may be simply interpreted as a global rotation of coordinates.",8
696,"the metric functions of the line element (6.20), this rotation can be shown to be equivalent to the result that, if ,,and are solutions of (6.22), then another solution is given by  (12.12)",8
697,"It may be noted that, in (12.12), the function is unaltered.",8
698,"Thus the boundary conditions are not affected, and so neither are the functions and .",8
699,"In fact, it is clear that (12.12) does not generate a new solution, but merely a rotation of the original.",8
700,"It can also be shown that, if the seed solution is colinear we can put , then the transformation (12.12) reduces to the transformation suggested by Ray (1980) as corrected by Halilsoy (1981).",8
701,"Another well known result is that, if is a solution of Ernst's equation (11.8), then  (12.13) where is a real constant, is also a solution.",8
702,"This is loosely referred to as an Ehlers transformation (Ehlers, 1957).",8
703,"Equivalently, if Ε is a solution of (11.14), then another solution is given by .",8
704,(12.14),8
705,"the metric functions in (6.20), we may start with the solutions ,,and of (6.22).",8
706,"After integrating (11.21), it can then be shown that another solution is given by  (12.15)",8
707,"Since the metric function is unchanged, it follows that the boundary conditions for the new solution are satisfied if, and only if, they are satisfied for the seed solution.",8
708,"The above transformation is also related to the well known result that, if is a solution of Ernst's equation (11.8), then another solution is given by  (12.16) where is a real constant.",8
709,"Equivalently, if Ε is a solution of (11.14), then another solution is given by  (12.17)",8
710,"the metric functions in (6.20), this leads to the transformation that, if ,,and are solutions of (6.22), then another solution is given by  (12.18) This can clearly be seen to be identical to (12.15) but with the sign of interchanged.",8
711,All of the above transformations can be shown to be obtainable from a general rotation and rescaling of the coordinates in the  plane.,8
712,"This can be described by subjecting the Killing vectors  to any  transformation , where .",8
713,(12.19),8
714,"This leaves and invariant but, by considering the line element (11.6), the Ernst function can be shown to transform as  (12.20)",8
715,"The transformation (12.20) clearly incorporates (12.10),(12.13) and (12.16) which include both pure rotations and those referred to as Ehlers transformations.",8
716,When applied to metric functions on its own this transformation clearly has little physical significance.,8
717,It follows that these transformations on their own can not be used to generate genuinely non-colinear solutions from colinear ones.,8
718,"However, they may be combined with some other method to obtain such solutions.",8
719,these transformations may be applied to the potentials for the metric functions that will be described in Section 12.4.,8
720,"Strictly speaking it is only these transformations, applied in the potential space, that should be referred to as Ehlers transformations (Ehlers, 1957).",8
721,It is then possible that a sequence both of coordinate transformations (12.19) and Ehlers transformations (12.20) in the potential space can be applied alternately to generate a further class of solutions with an infinite number of parameters.,8
722,Geroch transformations,8
723,Geroch (1971) has presented a general technique for generating solutions of Einstein's source-free equations from known solutions which possess a Killing vector.,8
724,"As originally presented, the method is to consider a vacuum space-time with metric , and to solve the equations  (12.21) for ,and the following conditions:.",8
725,(12.22)(A solution of these equations is known to exist.),8
726,"Then, the basic result is that a new solution of the source-free equations, an arbitrary real parameter , is given by  (12.23) where  (12.24) It can be seen that and are respectively the norm and twist potential of the Killing field.",8
727,This technique determines a new solution with one extra parameter α.,8
728,A second application of the method simply yields another member of the same one-parameter family of solutions.,8
729,It may be observed that the new space-times also have the same Killing vector as the seed solution.,8
730,It may also be shown that these transformations include both the Ehlers transformation and the rotation described in previous sections.,8
731,"The case when there exist two commuting Killing vectors, which is the case for colliding plane waves, has also been considered (Geroch, 1972).",8
732,"Clearly, the above technique may be applied using any linear combination of the Killing vectors.",8
733,Successive applications of the method using different combinations of the Killing vectors yield metrics which depend on the order of the vectors used.,8
734,"The resulting class of solutions depends on two arbitrary functions, and retains the same pair of commuting Killing vectors.",8
735,The algebraic structure of these transformations has been analysed by Geroch (1972).,8
736,"The Geroch transformations, which relate one vacuum solution to another, in fact form an infinite-dimensional group.",8
737,"The first really useful realization of the Lie algebra of the Geroch group was formulated by Kinnersley and Chitre (1977, 1978 , b), who demonstrated the action of the infinitesimal elements of the group an infinite hierarchy of potentials.",8
738,"Kinnersley and Chitre, and also Hoenselaers, Kinnersley and Xanthopoulos (1979), exploited this approach to derive new stationary axisymmetric solutions.",8
739,"This formalism has been extended to space-times with two space-like Killing vectors by Kitchingham (1984), although he initially applied it only in the cosmological context.",8
740,"Hauser and Ernst (1979, 1980) introduced a realization of the finite elements of the Geroch group.",8
741,They also showed that the Kinnersley-Chitre transformations can be carried out by solving an appropriate homogeneous Hilbert problem.,8
742,"A simpler realization  of the Geroch group of transformations which is specifically applied to colliding wave solutions has been found by Ernst, García-Díaz and Hauser (1987 ).",8
743,"With this, colliding wave solutions with any desired number of parameters may be constructed.",8
744,"When applying the original transformation (12.23) to colliding plane waves, it is convenient to start first with the Szekeres line element (6.20), in which the two Killing vectors are  and .",8
745,It is then appropriate to consider a general Killing vector  (12.25) where and are arbitrary constants.,8
746,It follows immediately that .,8
747,(12.26) It is then possible to put two of the components of  each equal to zero.,8
748,Putting  (12.27) the remaining components of  must then satisfy the equations .,8
749,(12.28),8
750,These equations are automatically integrable (6.22).,8
751,It is then possible to put  (12.29) and to choose the components of  such that .,8
752,(12.30) Equations (12.21) are then satisfied.,8
753,The new metric is then given by (12.23).,8
754,The expressions for the new functions are rather involved.,8
755,"However, it is clear that  (12.31) which indicates that the boundary conditions are satisfied for the new solution, if they were satisfied for the seed solution.",8
756,"In the case when the initial solution has colinear polarization, this method can be considerably simplified.",8
757,"Such a situation was considered by Panov (1979 ), and will be discussed further in Section 13.2.",8
758,The Neugebauer-Kramer involution,8
759,Chandrasekhar and Ferrari (1984) have shown that the main field equations for colliding plane waves can be written in the form of Ernst's equation (11.18) involving the complex function .,8
760,"In this case, the real and imaginary parts of this function, denoted by , are the metric coefficients given by (11.2–4).",8
761,"Using these components, the main field equations can be written as  (12.32) and .",8
762,(12.33) These are respectively the real and imaginary parts of (11.18).,8
763,The second of these equations immediately implies that there exists a function Φ .,8
764,(12.34) It follows that must satisfy the equation  (12.35),8
765,"At this point, it is convenient to introduce a new function Ψdefined by  (12.36) From (11.1) and (10.11), it may be seen that -Ψ is the coefficient of in the line element (11.4).",8
766,"With this definition and (12.34), the equations (12.32) and (12.35) can now be rewritten in the form  (12.37) and  (12.38)",8
767,These equations may be seen to be identical to (12.32) and (12.33) with Ψ and Φ replacing and .,8
768,"Thus, if  is a solution of (11.18), then another solution is given by  (12.39) where Ψ is given by (12.36), and Φ is chosen to satisfy (12.34).",8
769,This correspondence is known as the Neugebauer-Kramer involution.,8
770,It is known to map real metrics to real metrics only for space-times with two space-like Killing vectors.,8
771,"In modern terminology, it is clear that the equations (12.34) provide an auto-Bäcklund transformation for the Ernst equation (11.18).",8
772,"to obtain the remaining metric function it is necessary to integrate equations (7.9), which may be rewritten in the form  (12.40) which is equivalent to (11.21).",8
773,the alternative functions Ψ and Φ these become  (12.41),8
774,"It follows from this that, for any solution with  and there exists another solution with  and where .",8
775,"(12.42) This immediately indicates that, if the initial solution satisfies the boundary conditions for colliding plane waves, then so also does the new solution, provided .",8
776,(12.43),8
777,"A second application of this technique only leads back to the original solution, an arbitrary complex constant.",8
778,The presence of such a constant has already been considered in Section 12.2 following equation (12.16).,8
779,"It may be noted in passing that, in the colinear case in which  and , this generation technique is equivalent to putting  which is effectively contained in (12.1) but with a change in the sign of .",8
780,"This, , would generate the Ferrari-Ibañez solution from the Khan-Penrose solution.",8
781,"It is of interest to observe that, for stationary axisymmetric space-times, the main field equations can be written in the form of Ernst's equation (11.8), whose solution  is considered as a complex potential for the metric functions and that are obtained from (12.36) and (12.34).",8
782,"In contrast, for colliding plane waves, both the potential (12.39) and the metric function (11.5) satisfy the same equation.",8
783,"Thus, in this case, the Neugebauer-Kramer involution is equivalent to a generation  technique in which any solution has a dual solution in which the metric functions and the associated potentials are interchanged.",8
784,A combined transformation,8
785,"In a recent paper, Halilsoy (1988 ) has considered a technique which he applied initially in the context of colliding shock electromagnetic waves (Halilsoy, 1988 ).",8
786,This can be described as follows.,8
787,"If is a solution of the vacuum equations (9.3),(10.2) or (10.13) corresponding to a collision of colinear gravitational waves (with ), then a non-colinear solution is given the function Ε satisfying (11.14) by  (12.44) where  (12.45) where α is an arbitrary constant.",8
788,The original solution is obtained when  and .,8
789,"the alternative function , the original solution may be described by a real function and the new solution satisfying (11.8) is then given by  (12.46) This can thus be seen to be a transformation of the type (12.2) followed by an Ehlers transformation in a slightly more general form than (12.13).",8
790,"the metric functions of the Szekeres line element (6.20), the original solution is described by the three functions ,and which are each functions of and where, as in (7.8), it is convenient to put  (12.47) and, as in (12.4),(12.48)",8
791,The new solution (12.44) is given by .,8
792,(12.49),8
793,"With this, equations (7.7) can be integrated to give  (12.50) which is similar to (12.2).",8
794,"Now, using the same arguments as in Section 12.1, the new solution will only satisfy the appropriate boundary conditions if the forms of the functions and are modified.",8
795,Accordingly we now put .,8
796,(12.51),8
797,The parameters and are now expressed the null coordinates and in the form  (12.52) where .,8
798,"(12.53) With this restriction, the boundary conditions are satisfied, and .",8
799,(12.54),8
800,"If, in the original solution, the functions ,and have been chosen the terms  in (12.47) have already cancelled the terms  and  in , then the new solution for will be given by .",8
801,(12.55),8
802,The method described in this section has been used by Halilsoy (1988 ) to obtain a class of solutions which appears to generalize the Szekeres solutions.,8
803,"However, since it has been obtained by a real transformation followed by an Ehlers transformation, as described at the end of Section 12.2 it is essentially simply a rotation and rescaling of the Szekeres solutions.",8
804,It does not therefore describe the collision of genuinely non-aligned gravitational waves.,8
805,Other methods,8
806,"Within the context of stationary axisymmetric space-times, many techniques have been developed in recent years by which new solutions may  be obtained from initial vacuum solutions.",8
807,Most of these methods can be applied also to the colliding plane wave situation.,8
808,"The main difference being that, in this case, the solutions of Ernst's equation may themselves either be metric functions or potentials for those functions as described in Section 12.4.",8
809,The other difference relates to the change of boundary conditions.,8
810,"For stationary axisymmetric solutions, it is usual to impose the condition that the space-times are asymptotically flat, and techniques for generating new solutions of Ernst's equation in which the space-time satisfies this condition have been developed.",8
811,"One of the most general of these is that of Cosgrove (1977), which generalizes the Tomimatsu-Sato solutions to arbitrary continuous deformation parameter .",8
812,"However, for colliding plane waves, the boundary conditions are of a totally different character, and many of the solutions of Ernst's equation that are appropriate for axisymmetric fields, the Tomimatsu-Sato solutions, are now found to be inconsistent with the boundary conditions for colliding plane waves.",8
813,"Hassan, Feinstein and Manko (1990) have adapted a generating technique of Gutsunaev and Manko (1988) for stationary axisymmetric space-times to derive solutions which describe the interaction following the collision of plane gravitational waves.",8
814,This technique generates solutions in which the approaching waves have variable polarization from a ‘seed’ solution of the equation (10.13) for the colinear case.,8
815,A solution of the Ernst equation (11.17) is then given by  (12.56) where α is a constant and the functions  and  are obtained by integrating the equations  (12.57) The boundary conditions then have to be applied.,8
816,"One particularly important technique that has been developed in recent years is the inverse scattering method of Belinskii and Zakharov (1978, 1979) which had previously been developed as a soliton technique.",8
817,"This method has been applied by Carr and Verdaguer (1983) to plane-symmetric space-times, and their results have been interpreted cosmological gravitational waves.",8
818,The relation between this and other techniques has been analysed by Letelier (1987).,8
819,"The first solution for colliding plane gravitational waves that was obtained using the inverse scattering method was that of Ferrari and Ibañez (1987 ), who obtained the solution described in Section 10.4 using the method in the form developed by Carr and Verdaguer (1983).",8
820,In this paper they took as seed metric the Kasner solution (10.26) which is equivalent to the Stoyanov solution (10.29).,8
821,"It may therefore be noted that, although the new solution satisfies the boundary conditions for colliding plane waves, the seed solution in this case does not.",8
822,"Non-aligned solutions have also been obtained using this method by Ferrari, Ibañez and Bruni (1987 ).",8
823,Another solution-generating technique that has been developed in recent years is that associated with Bäcklund transformations.,8
824,These were first applied to general relativity independently by Harrison (1978) and Neugebauer (1979).,8
825,"Bäcklund transformations can also be described as double-Harrison transformations, or as quadruple-Neugebauer transformations.",8
826,"The explicit relation between this technique and other methods has been discussed by Cosgrove (1980, 1982).",8
827,The effect of a double-Harrison transformation can be deduced by any number of competing techniques.,8
828,"Hauser and Ernst (1979, 1980) developed a method which involves solving a homogeneous Hilbert problem.",8
829,Cosgrove (1981) has shown how Bäcklund transformations can be conveniently expressed in this formalism.,8
830,"The method has been applied to colliding wave problems by Ernst, García-Díaz and Hauser (1988)(see also Ernst, 1988), and a class of new colliding wave solutions has been obtained.",8
831,"It has been observed by Witten (1979) that Einstein's vacuum equations for stationary, axisymmetric space-times are equivalent to a form of the self-dual Yang-Mills equations.",8
832,He therefore suggested that it should be possible to generate solutions of Einstein's equations by using twistor methods to construct self-dual Yang-Mills fields with appropriate symmetries.,8
833,"Such an approach to stationary axisymmetric space-times has subsequently been developed by Ward (1983), Woodhouse (1987) and also by Woodhouse and Mason (1988), who showed how this approach relates to the other solution-generating techniques mentioned above.",8
834,It follows that this approach may also be applied for other types of space-times  which contain two commuting Killing vectors.,8
835,Woodhouse (1989) has applied these techniques to generate cylindrical gravitational waves.,8
836,Twistor techniques may also be developed to generate colliding plane wave solutions.,8
837,Any of the above techniques may be used to generate new solutions of Ernst's equation.,8
838,Most have been applied mainly to stationary axisymmetric space-times.,8
839,"They may, however, also be used to generate solutions of Ernst's equation that can be considered as possible to colliding plane wave solutions.",8
840,The difficulty is then to find under what circumstances the appropriate boundary conditions are satisfied.,8
841,a new solution in region IV satisfies these conditions will generally depend both on the particular technique that is employed and also on the initial seed solution.,8
842,VACUUM SOLUTIONS WITH NON-ALIGNED POLARIZATION,8
843,The purpose of this chapter is to describe the known exact solutions for colliding gravitational waves in which the polarization of the approaching waves is not aligned.,8
844,The first solution of this type was obtained by Nutku and Halil (1977).,8
845,"A further generalization of this solution was attempted by Halil (1979), but this has subsequently been found to be incorrect and so will not be considered here.",8
846,The Nutku-Halil solution,8
847,The Khan-Penrose solution discussed in Chapter 3 describes the collision of impulsive waves whose polarization vectors are aligned.,8
848,Nutku and Halil (1977) have generalized this solution to give one which describes the collision of impulsive gravitational waves with non-colinear polarization.,8
849,This is the most simple solution of this type.,8
850,"the Szekeres line element (6.20), the metric functions of this solution can be written in the form  (13.1) where  (13.2) and α and β are constants (α -β) is the angle between the polarization vectors of the approaching waves.",8
851,This solution can be seen to reduce to the Khan-Penrose solution (3.9) when .,8
852,It may also be observed that the functions and are given by  and .,8
853,This solution has been analysed in great detail by Chandrasekhar and Ferrari (1984).,8
854,Their approach commences by rewriting the field equations in the form of Ernst's equation as described in Chapter 11.,8
855,It can then be seen from (11.20) that Ε is the associated Ernst function.,8
856,Chandrasekhar and Ferrari were then able to show that the Nutku-Halil solution is obtained by the simple choice of Ernst function given by  (13.3) where and are real constants which satisfy the condition .,8
857,"It is always possible to use a rotation of the type (12.9) to put , and in this case  and .",8
858,It can easily be shown that the Ernst function associated with this solution is given by  (13.4),8
859,It may be observed that (13.3) is in fact the Ernst potential which leads to the Kerr solution for stationary axisymmetric space-times.,8
860,This reduces to the potential for the Schwarzschild solution when  or .,8
861,Thus the difference in the polarization of the approaching waves in this situation can be seen to be equivalent to the rotational parameter in the Kerr solution.,8
862,"Taking the Ernst functions as (13.3) or (13.4), it can be shown that the boundary conditions described in Section 7.2 can only be satisfied if  and  It is then convenient to transform the null coordinates and .",8
863,Thus the form (13.2) is obtained uniquely from the Ernst function (13.3).,8
864,It also follows from this that the approaching waves necessarily contain impulsive components.,8
865,"Expressions for the components of the Weyl tensor 0, 2 and 4 describing the wave and interaction components have been given by Chandrasekhar and Ferrari (1984), though in a notation which differs slightly from that adopted here.",8
866,"However, it can still be clearly seen that this solution is a generalization of the Khan-Penrose solution in which the approaching impulsive waves have different polarization.",8
867,"the initial impulsive waves on the boundaries  and , the interiors of regions II and III are flat.",8
868,It can also be seen that the singularity structure of this solution is the same as that of the Khan-Penrose solution.,8
869,"There is a curvature singularity on the space-like surface  in region IV, and there  are fold singularities in regions II and III which are identical to those described in Section 8.3.",8
870,"It may also be pointed out that Ernst (1986) has shown that  the Nutku-Halil solution can also be obtained using a double-Harrison (Bäcklund) transformation, with the seed metric being the isotropic Kasner metric.",8
871,The Panov solution,8
872,"Panov (1979 ) has applied the generation method of Geroch (1971), described in Section 12.3, to obtain a non-colinear solution from a colinear one.",8
873,"the metric functions in (6.20), Panov started with a colinear solution ,, and of (6.22) with .",8
874,He then worked with the Killing vector  which is (12.25) with  and .,8
875,"This enabled him to put , and hence , and also from (12.30), and , where .",8
876,"With these expressions, the metric components may be derived from (12.23), giving  (13.5) where, from (12.28),must satisfy  (13.6) or, more conveniently,.",8
877,(13.7),8
878,"It is worth pointing out that, if the initial Killing vector had been taken to be , which is (12.25) with  and , an equivalent transformation would have been obtained with  and .",8
879,"This would have given an identical set of equations, but with being replaced by -, and by .",8
880,"the Ernst formulation of the problem described in Chapter 11, the above transformation implies that, if is a real solution of (11.18), then a new complex solution is given by  (13.8) where  must satisfy the equations  (13.9)",8
881,"Panov then took the initial solution to be the totally general solution of Szekeres (1972), which can be considered to be equivalent to the general solution given here by (10.16).",8
882,"He has thus determined a general class of non-colinear solutions, and he was able to show that, when the appropriate boundary conditions have been applied, the approaching waves necessarily have variable polarization.",8
883,It has already been shown that the new solution obtained using a Geroch transformation will automatically satisfy the required boundary conditions if these are satisfied by the initial solution.,8
884,"In this case, it can also be seen that the new and initial solutions have the same singularity structure.",8
885,The Chandrasekhar-Xanthopoulos solution,8
886,"Chandrasekhar and Ferrari (1984) have shown that the associated Ernst function which is contained in the Nutku-Halil solution can be written as  (13.3), where .",8
887,"Now, it is well known (see Chandrasekhar, 1983) that this is the Ernst potential that leads to the Kerr solution for stationary axisymmetric space-times.",8
888,"However, as described in Section 12.4, Chandrasekhar and Ferrari have also shown that, for the colliding plane wave situation, the Ernst function may be regarded either (a) as containing the metric functions, or (b) as a potential for those functions.",8
889,"When the Ernst function (13.3) is considered as containing the metric functions, it leads to the Nutku-Halil solution described above.",8
890,"However, when the same function is considered as a potential, it then leads to the Kerr solution.",8
891,"Thus part of the  Kerr space-time must also be considered as a solution of the colliding plane wave equations, though in this situation the coordinates have a different interpretation.",8
892,This alternative interpretation of part of the Kerr space-time has been described in detail by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1986 ).,8
893,Essentially it may be considered to have been derived from the Nutku-Halil solution using the Neugebauer-Kramer involution described in Section 12.4.,8
894,"We start here with the Ernst potential given by , (13.10) where .",8
895,"(12.36), the first metric function is then given by  (13.11) and, from (12.34),is given by  (13.12) where  (13.13) With this,(13.12) becomes  (13. 14) which can immediately be integrated to give  (13.15) where is an arbitrary constant.",8
896,Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos have chosen the constant of integration in (13.15) when .,8
897,The reason for this choice is associated with the convenience of aligning the coordinate directions with the shear axes on the surface  on which the two waves mutually focus .,8
898,Accordingly we set .,8
899,(13.16),8
900,A variation of this constant is equivalent to making an Ehlers transformation as described in (12.16–18).,8
901,"With (13.16), may now be written in either of the forms  (13.17)",8
902,"For purposes of simplification, it is convenient to introduce the terms  (13.18)",8
903,"(12.43) and (13.1), in this case we must have .",8
904,(13.19),8
905,"The metric function can also be obtained from (12.42) and (13.1), giving .",8
906,(13.20),8
907,"These expressions now complete all the metric functions contained in the line element (11.4), which may now be written as .",8
908,(13.21),8
909,"After some rearrangement, this may be written in the more convenient form .",8
910,(13.22) in which does not appear in a denominator.,8
911,"to show that this is indeed the Kerr solution, we first relabel the parameters by putting  (13.23) which satisfies the condition  for arbitrary constants and α.",8
912,"It is also appropriate to introduce the new coordinates and θ and given by  (13.24) where it may be noticed that, using the previous notation,.",8
913,The remaining coordinates may also be transformed by putting  (13 25) It is also convenient to introduce the definitions .,8
914,(13.26) With these substitutions the line element (13.22) may then be written in the form  (13.27) which after rescaling d is the standard form of the Kerr solution.,8
915,"For this solution to describe the interaction region of colliding waves, the coordinates must satisfy the inequality .",8
916,"With (13.24), this implies that  (13.28) which is satisfied only by the region of the Kerr space-time that is inside the ergo-sphere.",8
917,"This is not unexpected, as this is the only region of Kerr space-time in which the Killing vectors are both space-like.",8
918,"The plane on which the two waves collide is given by , or by  which is between the two horizons.",8
919,"The hypersurface on which they mutually focus , which is given by  or , is here given by  which determines the horizons of the  Kerr solution.",8
920,"Thus, the curvature singularity which usually occurs when , in this case, is replaced by a coordinate singularity which is normally interpreted as a horizon of the Kerr solution.",8
921,The components of the Weyl tensor inside region IV can be derived using (11.10) and have been evaluated by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos.,8
922,"The space-time is of algebraic type D and, , it may be noted that  (13.29) The curvature is clearly non-singular as  except in the aligned case  (or ).",8
923,"In this case only, the surface  corresponds to a curvature singularity.",8
924,In the interaction region is a future pointing time-like coordinate.,8
925,It thus follows from (13.24) that is also a future pointing time-like coordinate which increases from the collision at  to the outer horizon at .,8
926,In this case a possible further extension beyond the horizon would present no problems.,8
927,"It may be noted, however, that if the signs of the expressions for ,and in (13.24) and (13.23) are changed, the Kerr metric (13.27) is still obtained but the orientation of is altered.",8
928,"In this case, the collision at  is followed by the inner horizon at  and any extension would lead to a future time-like curvature singularity at .",8
929,The difference between these two solution has been further analysed by Hoenselaers and Ernst (1990).,8
930,It is the latter case that has been described by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1986 ) in which there is an extension beyond the horizon at  which contains a time-like singularity analogous to the ring singularity of the Kerr solution at .,8
931,"Since this singularity is time-like, it would be missed by most observers.",8
932,"In the other case, which has been given explicitly above, there is an analytic extension which is the asymptotically flat exterior Kerr solution.",8
933,"It may be pointed out, however, that in both cases the extension beyond the horizon is not unique.",8
934,"When considering the question of the character of the coordinate singularity at , Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1986 ) have given a transformation by which it can be removed.",8
935,They have found it convenient to introduce a decreasing time-like coordinate given by .,8
936,"The transformation  (13.30) then removes the coordinate singularity at , or .",8
937,This provides an analytic extension beyond the Cauchy horizon which is another part of Kerr space-time.,8
938,"This extension, in one case, is followed by a time-like curvature singularity which corresponds to the source of the Kerr solution.",8
939,It may be seen that the singularity structure of this solution is very similar to that of the degenerate Ferrari-Ibañez solution described in detail in Section 10.5.,8
940,In fact this solution reduces to either of the two cases of the degenerate Ferrari-Ibañez solution in the limit as  which is the limit as the polarization of the approaching waves become aligned.,8
941,The non-singular case occurs when .,8
942,"It may be noted that in this limit , the rotation of the Kerr solution vanishes, and the solution reduces to the same part of the Schwarzschild space-time as the degenerate Ferrari-Ibañez solution.",8
943,"It is now appropriate to consider the extension of the solution into the prior regions I, II and III which describe the approaching waves that give rise to this particular interaction.",8
944,The metric (13.21) may easily be extended into region II simply by replacing both and by .,8
945,It turns out to be convenient to make the coordinate transformation .,8
946,"(13.31) With this, the line-element in region II takes the form  (13.32) where .",8
947,The line-element for region III is identical to (13.32) replaces .,8
948,Both these line-elements are then continuous with the Minkowski space (3.6) in region I.,8
949,The plane wave metric given by (13.32) has the single component of the curvature tensor given by .,8
950,(13.33) It may immediately be observed that the approaching waves have variable polarization except in the aligned limit .,8
951,They include an impulsive component and a step component.,8
952,"As in the degenerate Ferrari-Ibañez solution, the singularity structure is thus complicated by the fact that the solution contains impulsive waves on the wave fronts  and  which form the boundaries of the interaction region.",8
953,"The presence of these wave components introduces  additional distribution valued singularities at the points , and ,.",8
954,"As described in Chapter 8, these point singularities ensure the existence of fold singularities on the surfaces  and  in regions II and III respectively.",8
955,The profiles for the approaching waves in both cases have been described in more detail by Hoenselaers and Ernst (1990).,8
956,"They have shown that, in the case where the Cauchy horizon corresponds to the inner Kerr horizon, the amplitude diverges towards the fold singularity which is thus a non-scalar curvature singularity.",8
957,"On the other hand, when the Cauchy horizon corresponds to the outer Kerr horizon, the amplitude decays towards a quasiregular fold singularity.",8
958,Other solutions,8
959,It may be noticed that the solutions presented in the previous two sections have been obtained using the generating techniques described in Sections 12.3 and 12.4 respectively.,8
960,"Other techniques may also be used, both in isolation and in various combinations.",8
961,"Since they involve the same Ernst equation, it is clear that all the solution generating techniques that have been developed for stationary axisymmetric space-times in recent years can also be applied to colliding plane wave situations.",8
962,"A number of papers have recently been published which present new colliding wave solutions using some of these techniques, and it is likely that many more such papers will appear.",8
963,Most of these concentrate on a description of a particular technique and how it may be adapted to the colliding wave situation.,8
964,", however, there is less emphasis on the physical significance of the particular solution generated.",8
965,"Nevertheless, solutions with a number of parameters have been obtained, and general classes of solutions have been defined.",8
966,"Ideally, one would like to be able to specify the particular solution corresponding to an arbitrary set of initial conditions.",8
967,"Such techniques are available in the axisymmetric case, and may soon be extended to the colliding wave situation.",8
968,The initial attempts at the solution of this problem are mentioned in the next chapter.,8
969,So far most of the explicit solutions that have been presented have involved impulsive wave components.,8
970,"In the notation of (7.11), they have used .",8
971,Much less attention has been given to smooth-fronted waves of finite duration.,8
972,Some further general aspects of cases involving impulsive components have been clarified by Ferrari (1988).,8
973,", it has been shown that the proper time between the collision and the subsequent singularity is  inversely proportional to the square root of the amplitudes of the impulsive components of the approaching waves.",8
974,This time is also affected by their relative polarization and is a minimum when the approaching waves are colinear.,8
975,This result also applies to solutions which contain a Cauchy horizon a curvature singularity.,8
976,", Ferrari has also shown that the shock waves which accompany the impulsive waves only affect the rate at which the Weyl scalars diverge on the singularity.",8
977,"Having made these general remarks, we may now briefly review the new exact solutions that have been presented.",8
978,The generation techniques themselves will not be described in detail here.,8
979,"First, there is the important class of solutions that has been obtained by Ferrari, Ibañez and Bruni (1987 , b) using the inverse scattering method developed by Belinskii and Zakharov (1978, 1979) and Carr and Verdaguer (1983).",8
980,"Using this method, they have obtained a two-parameter class of colliding wave solutions with non-aligned polarization.",8
981,This in fact is a generalization of the soliton solution of Ferrari and Ibañez (1987 ) described in Sections 10.4 and 10.5.,8
982,The Ferrari-Ibañez-Bruni solution has been obtained using as seed the Kasner metric.,8
983,They utilize the Belinskii-Zakharov soliton technique with two real poles.,8
984,"The resulting metric for region IV is singular on the space-like surface , except in a particular limiting case.",8
985,"By extending the solution back into regions II and III, it can be seen that the approaching waves must have both an impulsive component and a step component with variable polarization.",8
986,The limiting case of the Ferrari-Ibañez-Bruni solution is particularly interesting.,8
987,"It is of type D, and can be shown to be part of the Taub-NUT solution in the Taub region where there are two space-like Killing vectors.",8
988,The line element can be written in the form  (13.34) where and are constants satisfying .,8
989,"It can immediately be seen that, when  and , this further reduces to the two colinear degenerate Ferrari-Ibañez solutions that have already been considered in Section 10.5.",8
990,The structure of this solution has been further examined by Ferrari and Ibañez (1988).,8
991,"Ernst, García-Díaz and Hauser (1987 ) have shown that an Ehlers transformation (12.13) applied to the Ernst function of the Nutku-Halil solution (13.3), together with a simple coordinate transformation, yields a non-colinear generalization of the Ferrari Ibañez soliton solution that was described in Section 10.4 but only with even integer values of the parameter α.",8
992,"This generalization is in fact contained in the solution of Ferrari, Ibañez and Bruni (1987 , b).",8
993,"A further generalization extending the Ferrari-Ibañez-Bruni solution was reported by Ernst, García-Díaz and Hauser (1987 , b), with a full derivation given in Ernst, García-Díaz and Hauser (1988).",8
994,This solution contains three arbitrary parameters.,8
995,"In stating this solution, it is convenient first to define the function  (13.35) where , α and β are the arbitrary parameters, and where .",8
996,"(13.36) With this definition, the Ernst function for this new solution may be written as  (13.37)",8
997,"When , this reduces to the Nutku-Halil solution.",8
998,"With , one obtains the Kerr-NUT solution with α being the NUT parameter.",8
999,The subcase with  and  becomes the Schwarzschild-NUT space-time.,8
1000,"Transforming (13.37) using the Neugebauer Kramer involution produces another three-parameter family of solutions with the alternative Ernst function given by  (13.38) With , this reduces to the Chandrasekhar-Xanthopoulos solution.",8
1001,"Ernst, García-Díaz and Hauser (1987 ) have also found a simpler realization  of the Geroch group of transformations relating colliding wave solutions.",8
1002,"With this, they have obtained a generalization of the  above solution in the case when .",8
1003,A further generalization of the  solution is also obtained using a Neugebauer-Kramer involution.,8
1004,It was pointed out by Ernst (1986) that the Nutku Halil solution can be derived from the isotropic () Kasner metric by applying a double-Harrison (Bäcklund) transformation.,8
1005,The Kerr space-time of the Chandrasekhar-Xanthopoulos solution can also be derived from Minkowski space using a double-Harrison transformation.,8
1006,It therefore seemed reasonable that other colliding wave solutions may be generated by applying double-Harrison transformations to other Kasner metrics.,8
1007,This procedure has indeed been successful.,8
1008,"It was used by Ernst, García-Díaz and Hauser (1988) to determine the solution described above in (13.35) to (13.38).",8
1009,The effect of a double-Harrison transformation can be deduced by any number of competing techniques.,8
1010,"Naturally, however, Ernst, García-Díaz and Hauser preferred to use the so-called Hauser-Ernst homogeneous Hilbert problem approach (see also Ernst 1988).",8
1011,"Finally, it may be mentioned that Hassan, Feinstein and Manko (1990) have recently obtained another particular solution describing the non-colinear case using the generating technique of Gutsunaev and Manko (1988) as described here in (12.56) and (15.57).",8
1012,Further solutions could easily be obtained using this method.,8
1013,THE INITIAL-VALUE PROBLEM,8
1014,The approach to finding exact solutions that has been taken so far has involved initially solving the field equations in the interaction region IV and then investigating the conditions under which these solutions can be considered as the result of collisions of plane waves.,8
1015,"In this way, resulting solutions are found first and the initial conditions are obtained subsequently.",8
1016,In this chapter it is appropriate to return to the original problem of specifying the initial data and then attempting to find the solution that determines the subsequent development.,8
1017,The initial data,8
1018,The problem that is under consideration is the collision of two plane waves in a flat background.,8
1019,"It is assumed that the two approaching waves are both known, and it is required to find the exact solution which describes the interaction following the collision.",8
1020,This problem has been formulated in earlier chapters.,8
1021,It has been found convenient to divide space-time into the four regions as illustrated in Figure 3.1.,8
1022,"It has also been demonstrated that the metric in the interaction region IV may be taken in the form of the Szekeres line element (6.20) which involves the four functions ,, and  satisfying equations (6.22).",8
1023,One of these equations can be integrated to give .,8
1024,(14.1),8
1025,"In this approach, it is assumed that the initial conditions are determined by the functions  and  which represents the wave in region II as it reaches the boundary , and by  which represents the wave in region III as it reaches the boundary .",8
1026,This is now a typical case of the characteristic initial-value problem.,8
1027,"In practice, however, things are more complicated since it is normal to make use of the transformation (6.7) to put  in these initial regions.",8
1028,In this case the approaching waves are each described by three functions either of or of satisfying a single equation which is either (6.22c) or (6.22b).,8
1029,"The difficulty arises because, as described in previous chapters, it is convenient to use and , or transformations of them, as coordinates in  the interaction region.",8
1030,"Accordingly, it is therefore more convenient to use the transformation (6.7) in the initial regions to put  (14.2) where the constants  and  are essential to retain the continuity properties of the functions and across the boundaries  and .",8
1031,These constants feature prominently in the junction conditions as described in Section 7.2.,8
1032,They are determined by the character of the wavefronts of the approaching waves.,8
1033,"In this case, the data specifying the initial waves is now given by  on , and by  on .",8
1034,", since the function is essentially determined a removable constant for any and by equations (6.22b, c), the initial data is effectively described by specifying only the metric functions and on the boundaries  and .",8
1035,It is also appropriate to re-express these as functions of and .,8
1036,The remaining problem is now to integrate the main field equations to determine the functions and in the interaction region their specification on the initial null boundaries.,8
1037,The colinear case,8
1038,"For the case when the approaching waves have aligned linear polarization it is possible to put  everywhere, and the main field equation for may be expressed different coordinates in any of the forms (9.3),(10.2),(10.11),(10.60) or (10.71).",8
1039,At this point we may take and as coordinates and consider the equation in the form (10.2) which may be rewritten as .,8
1040,(14.3) This equation must now be solved for  with initial data defining the approaching waves given by  and .,8
1041,"It is also possible to scale the approaching waves at the point of collision , and .",8
1042,Equation (14.3) is an Euler-Poisson Darboux equation whose solution may be expressed as a line integral.,8
1043,"As originally pointed out in this context by Szekeres (1972) and later repeated by Yurtsever (1988 ), since (14.3) is a linear hyperbolic equation, it may also be solved explicitly using Riemann's method.",8
1044,"this method, we consider the adjoint equation  (14,4) where is a Riemann-Green function satisfying the boundary conditions .",8
1045,(14.5),8
1046,"Figure 14.1 The interaction region IV is represented in ,coordinates by the region inside the triangle shown.",8
1047,"The sides  and  are the II-IV and III-IV boundaries respectively, and the focusing singularity occurs on the line .",8
1048,The solution for  may be obtained at any point by integrating round the rectangle PNML.,8
1049,By using Green's theorem the integral of  over the rectangle PNML indicated in Figure 14.1 can be related to its line integral around the boundary.,8
1050,"In this way it can be shown that, for any arbitrary point  within the interaction region, the function is given by  (14.6) satisfies (14.4) and (14.5) and that .",8
1051,A specific Riemann Green function which satisfies (14.4) and (14.5) is given by  (14.7) where  is the Legendre function of order -½.,8
1052,"By substituting this and the initial expressions for on the boundaries ML and MN into (14.6), an explicit integral for in the interaction region is obtained.",8
1053,This approach of using Riemann's method has been generalized by Xanthopoulos (1986) to include the collision of null fluids coupled with plane gravitational waves.,8
1054,This particular situation will be discussed later in Section 20.2.,8
1055,"At this point, we may simply note that the method involved is essentially the same.",8
1056,"Although the method described above does give an explicit integral expression for , in practice it is extremely difficult to evaluate this integral for arbitrary initial data.",8
1057,"Thus, it does not really provide a viable method for generating analytic solutions for any given analytic description of the approaching waves.",8
1058,Another problem with the method of Riemann is that it is not practically possible to generalize it to the case for non-colinear collisions.,8
1059,"The method only applies to linear hyperbolic equations and, if the polarization of the approaching waves is not aligned, the field equations describing the resulting interaction are non-linear.",8
1060,"this, Hauser and Ernst (1989 , b, 1990) have developed an alternative method which can be generalized to the non-colinear situation.",8
1061,The method employed by Hauser and Ernst (1989 ) is first to find a one-parameter family of basic solutions a suitable separation of variables and then to express the  final solution as a linear super-position of these basic solutions.,8
1062,"In fact their approach is based on the solution (10.8), which may be re-expressed in the form  (14.8) for suitable functions  and  which must depend on the initial data.",8
1063,An interesting feature of the method is that the functions  and  are obtained the prescribed initial data by solving generalized versions of Abel's integral equation for the tautochrone problem of classical particle mechanics.,8
1064,Generalized versions of Abel's integral equation are required because and are zero on the boundaries  and  respectively.,8
1065,Full details of the method have been described by Hauser and Ernst (1989 ).,8
1066,"However, the techniques are still difficult to use in practice for arbitrary initial data.",8
1067,Hauser and Ernst (1989 ) have also reformulated the initial-value problem for the colinear case as a Hilbert problem in a complex plane in two different ways.,8
1068,"They have presented solutions of both forms of the Hilbert problem and shown that each of these agrees with the solution that is obtained by the method referred to above (Hauser and Ernst, 1989 ).",8
1069,The non-colinear case,8
1070,"Hauser and Ernst (1989 , b, 1990) have developed the techniques mentioned at the end of the previous section to deal specifically with the case when the polarization of the approaching waves is not aligned.",8
1071,The initial data have already been described in Section 14.1.,8
1072,"It was also pointed out that, for the colinear case, it was convenient to rescale the approaching waves at the point of collision.",8
1073,"For the non-colinear case, Hauser and Ernst have found it convenient to work with the complex function defined by (11.5) and to use the transformation (12.20) which consists of a rotation and rescaling to put  at the point of collision when  and .",8
1074,For the colinear case the main field equation (14.3) is linear.,8
1075,"However, for the non-colinear case this is replaced by two non-linear equations, or by the complex Ernst equation.",8
1076,The non-linearity of this equation introduces considerable difficulty into any attempt at solving the general problem.,8
1077,Hauser and Ernst (1990) have developed a method for considering the initial-value problem for general colliding plane gravitational waves.,8
1078,They have achieved this by replacing the usual initial-value problem the Ernst equation by an equivalent 2 × 2 matrix homogeneous Hilbert problem in the complex plane.,8
1079,"In the case when the polarization of the approaching waves is colinear, this approach reduces to the relatively simple one-dimensional Hilbert problem that was previously considered (Hauser and Ernst, 1989 ).",8
1080,"A detailed description of the method developed, however, is beyond the scope of this book and interested readers are directed to the original papers.",8
1081,"these advances, there is strong evidence that the general solution of the initial-value problem for the non-colinear case is not expressible in a finite closed form.",8
1082,", practical methods for solving the matrix homogeneous Hilbert problem for particular non-colinear cases still need to be developed.",8
1083,Clearly this is an area where considerable further work is required.,8
1084,COLLIDING ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES: THE BELL-SZEKERES SOLUTION,8
1085,"In an important paper, Bell and Szekeres (1974) gave an exact solution which describes the collision and subsequent interaction of two electromagnetic plane waves.",8
1086,"This solution, which appears to be remarkably simple, will be described in this chapter.",8
1087,"Other exact solutions describing colliding electromagnetic waves will be described in Chapters 16 and 17, after more powerful techniques have been developed.",8
1088,The Bell-Szekeres solution,8
1089,Bell and Szekeres have considered a very simple situation involving a collision of two step electromagnetic waves.,8
1090,"the collision, the waves may be described by the familiar line element (4.15).",8
1091,"In regions I and II, this takes the form  (15.1) and the step wave is given by .",8
1092,"The opposing wave with  may be described in an identical way with the null coordinate replaced by , and a different space-like coordinate replacing .",8
1093,"The two electromagnetic field components in the initial regions I, II and III are taken to be .",8
1094,(15.2) The fact that both of these expressions are real simultaneously indicates that the polarization of the two electromagnetic waves is aligned.,8
1095,", they have identical step profiles.",8
1096,"The relative amplitudes and may, , both be equated to unity when convenient.",8
1097,The components of the Weyl tensor are initially all zero.,8
1098,"By this stage, we are familiar with the fact that it is appropriate to transform the metrics in all regions into Rosen form.",8
1099,"Accordingly, the line elements in the initial regions may be taken in the forms of (4.19) and (4.20), namely  (15.3) The initial-value problem is now well set, and it remains to find the unique solution in the interaction region.",8
1100,The field equations for colliding electromagnetic waves have already been obtained in Chapter 6.,8
1101,"the metric functions of the Szekeres line element (6.20), the gravitational field equations for the interaction region take the form (6.22), and Maxwell's equations are given by (6.21).",8
1102,The appropriate boundary conditions for this situation have been described in Chapter 7.,8
1103,", it may be noted that (6.22a) can immediately be integrated to give  (15 4) where and are arbitrary decreasing functions in the interaction region.",8
1104,"From the junction conditions it can be seen that, in this case, these functions necessarily take the forms:.",8
1105,"(15.5) The solution of the complete set of equations (6.21,22) given by Bell and Szekeres is .",8
1106,(15.6),8
1107,It can be seen that these functions satisfy the required O'Brien-Synge boundary conditions.,8
1108,Thus the line element in the interaction region IV is .,8
1109,(15.7),8
1110,"This line element is in fact one form of the Bertotti-Robinson solution (Bertotti 1959, Robinson 1959), which is known to be conformally flat.",8
1111,The coordinate transformation  (15.8) transforms the line element (15.7) into the more familiar form .,8
1112,(15 9),8
1113,Halilsoy (1987) has considered an application of the transformation  to the above solution.,8
1114,"However, this does not lead to any new results that are of physical significance.",8
1115,The structure of the solution,8
1116,The above solution describes the collision of two step electromagnetic waves whose polarization vectors are aligned.,8
1117,"This follows from the fact that  is real, and .",8
1118,"As has been pointed out above, the solution inside the interaction region IV is conformally flat.",8
1119,"However, as Bell and Szekeres have shown, there are necessarily discontinuities in the derivatives of the metric function across the initial boundaries of this region.",8
1120,These manifest themselves as the impulsive gravitational waves  (15.10) which may be considered to be generated by the collision.,8
1121,It is in fact a general feature of colliding electromagnetic plane waves that gravitational waves are always generated by the collision.,8
1122,"This can easily be demonstrated by considering the field equations (6.22d, e).",8
1123,"In the interaction region, and  are necessarily both non-zero.",8
1124,It follows that and can not both remain constant.,8
1125,"Thus, the congruences tangent to both waves must begin to shear, and it can be seen from (6.23) that the components of the Weyl tensor  and , and possibly  will necessarily appear.",8
1126,"In this case, the discontinuity in the electromagnetic components causes impulsive gravitational waves to be generated.",8
1127,It can also be shown that smooth-fronted electromagnetic waves would generate smooth-fronted or step gravitational waves that  persist through the interaction region.,8
1128,It may also be observed from (15.10) that difficulties occur at the points .,8
1129,"At first sight, it would appear that curvature singularities occur at these points (Matzner and Tipler, 1984).",8
1130,"However, curvature tensors of this type can be interpreted as distributions (see Geroch and Traschen, 1987) and, in this case, the standard definition of a curvature singularity unboundedness in a  propagated frame is inapplicable.",8
1131,The global structure of this solution has been analysed in detail by Clarke and Hayward (1989).,8
1132,"They have confirmed that, in regions II and III, the surfaces on which  and  respectively behave as ‘fold’ singularities similar to those of the Khan-Penrose solution described in Section 8.2.",8
1133,"Initially, the most surprising feature of the Bell-Szekeres solution was that a space-like curvature singularity does not occur in region IV.",8
1134,"In this case, the surface on which , which is here given by , turns out to be merely a coordinate singularity since the curvature tensor is clearly bounded.",8
1135,Bell and Szekeres have demonstrated how this singularity can be removed by considering the following coordinate transformation:(15.11) where .,8
1136,"With this, the line element (15.6) becomes  (15.12) which is clearly regular when .",8
1137,"to retain the one-to-one correspondence, it is appropriate initially to restrict the Bell-Szekeres coordinate to the range .",8
1138,"The coordinates and are restricted by , where the boundary  contains the space-like plane on which the collision occurs.",8
1139,It has been shown by Clarke and Hayward (1989) that region IV is part of a space-time that is regular two covering-space singularities that occur when .,8
1140,These are points on the boundary of region IV where it joins with the limits of regions II and III.,8
1141,"At these points, which are on the polar axis  and  in the Bertotti-Robinson form of the metric (15.9),.",8
1142,"With the above transformation, each interval of the coordinate of length corresponds to a circular region in the ,plane with the origin removed and cut along the line .",8
1143,Neighbouring regions of are joined together along these cuts to form a surface which continuously winds around the origin.,8
1144,"The origin of the ,plane thus corresponds to a singularity of a quasiregular covering-space type.",8
1145,"It is also sometimes convenient (Clarke and Hayward, 1989) to make the further coordinate transformation  (15.13) With this, the line element (15.12) takes the alternative form of the Bertotti-Robinson line element  (15.14) Region IV is now described by the line element (15.14) with the coordinate ranges given by  (15.15) This is joined to regions II and III across the surfaces .",8
1146,(15.16),8
1147,"Clarke and Hayward (1989) have also shown that the Bell-Szekeres solution is extendable to the future through the surface , but the extension is not unique the presence of the singularities.",8
1148,They have further suggested two possible extensions which will be described in the next section.,8
1149,"It is also somewhat remarkable that the global structure of the Bell-Szekeres solution, as described by Clarke and Hayward (1989), is very similar to that of the collision of an impulsive gravitational wave with a null shell of matter, as described by Babala (1987).",8
1150,This will be discussed in Section 19.3.,8
1151,Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1988) have conducted a thorough perturbation analysis of this particular solution.,8
1152,Throughout the interaction region the collision they have obtained a complete set  of bounded normal modes that are expressed spin-weighted spherical harmonics.,8
1153,These modes exhibit a behaviour of ever-increasing frequency as the Cauchy horizon is approached.,8
1154,Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1988) have also considered perturbations in the initial regions which contain the approaching waves.,8
1155,"For the approaching wave in region II which propagates along the null line ,, they have shown that -independent perturbations are not permitted to all orders, while all the -dependent perturbations exhibit strong divergences along the ‘fold’ singularity.",8
1156,"Unfortunately, these perturbations can not be joined continuously to those of the interaction region.",8
1157,It is therefore not possible to consider the effects of these perturbations the collision.,8
1158,Extensions of the solution,8
1159,"In the Bell-Szekeres solution, it has been shown that the hypersurface  on which the opposing waves mutually focus is a Cauchy horizon a curvature singularity.",8
1160,"It is therefore appropriate to consider possible extensions to this solution through the horizon, any such extension will not be unique.",8
1161,Two possible extensions have been given by Clarke and Hayward (1989).,8
1162,One natural extension of region IV is simply the future extension of the region as described by the line element (15.14).,8
1163,This is achieved by extending the coordinate range to  (15.17) where .,8
1164,"In this extension, the waves cross and focus.",8
1165,The subsequent space-time is unchanging.,8
1166,Another equally natural extension of region IV is obtained by noting that the line element (15.14) admits a reflection symmetry  about the hyperplane  (or  about ).,8
1167,"Thus, there is an extension in which region IV is extended as far as  and is then followed by the time reverse of the entire solution.",8
1168,"In this extension, the waves cross, mutually focus , re-expand and then separate leaving Minkowski space between them to the future.",8
1169,This situation is illustrated in Figure 15.1 the original null coordinates and the line elements (15.3) and (15.7).,8
1170,Other apparent extensions of the Bell-Szekeres solution have been suggested by Gürses and Halilsoy (1982) in which the approaching electromagnetic waves consist of a sequence of steps.,8
1171,"The step lengths, however, have to be double the distance to the fold singularities.",8
1172,"Thus, these  solutions necessarily extend the space-time through the covering space singularities and can not, therefore, be considered as appropriate solutions for colliding plane waves.",8
1173,In all these solutions the space-time can only be extended uniquely the fold singularities in regions II and III and the surface in region IV on which .,8
1174,It must therefore be concluded that the Gürses-Halilsoy extensions are not physically significant.,8
1175,Figure 15.1 An extension of the Bell-Szekeres space-time.,8
1176,Regions marked I are flat.,8
1177,"Regions marked II and III contain electromagnetic waves with , and  respectively, having metrics given by (15.3).",8
1178,"There are impulsive gravitational waves along the boundaries of region IV, which has metric (15.7).",8
1179,A non-colinear collision,8
1180,"In the Bell-Szekeres solution, the polarization of the approaching electromagnetic waves is aligned.",8
1181,It is appropriate now to consider how this solution may be generalized to include the case when the polarization is not aligned.,8
1182,In the approaching waves a rotation of the polarization is expressed by a rotation of the components Φ or Φ in the complex plane.,8
1183,"The metrics in both regions are unaltered, since a null electromagnetic field  is defined by the metric only up to a constant duality rotation.",8
1184,"Thus, to extend the Bell-Szekeres solution, the same initial conditions are given the component  becomes complex and, from (6.22e),must become non-zero in the interaction region.",8
1185,A solution presented by Griffiths (1985) satisfying this condition may be written in the form  (15.18) where  (15.19) The relative polarization angle of the two waves the collision is given by α.,8
1186,"It may be noticed that the expression for here is equivalent to those of (15.4,5) and (15.6).",8
1187,The common multiple 2 has been inserted this solution can be more directly related to the Bell-Szekeres solution to which it reduces when .,8
1188,It can be shown that this solution has exactly the same properties as the aligned Bell-Szekeres solution.,8
1189,It is conformally flat everywhere except at the boundaries of the interaction region where there are impulsive gravitational waves that may be considered to be generated by the collision.,8
1190,These are given by  (15.20),8
1191,"a theorem of Tariq and Tupper (1974), this new solution must as be the Bertotti-Robinson space-time in a different coordinate system.",8
1192,In fact it can be obtained from the Bell-Szekeres line element (15.7) by the simple rotation  (15.21),8
1193,"Thus, the gravitational field in this case is identical to that of the Bell-Szekeres solution, as may have been expected.",8
1194,"In the collision of plane  electromagnetic waves with non-aligned polarization, it must therefore be concluded that the dynamics remains unaltered.",8
1195,It is only the form of the metric in the interaction region that needs to be modified to that given in this section.,8
1,HUMAN RESOURCES AND SYSTEM DESIGN,9
2,Concepts,9
3,The human contribution,9
4,The human role as a system controller,9
5,"The business of designing machines, processes and systems can be pursued more or less independently of the properties of people.",9
6,"Nevertheless people are always involved, the designer himself is a human being and his product will shape the behaviour of many workers and other users.",9
7,"More fundamentally, the design activity will be meaningless unless it is directed towards serving some human need.",9
8,"all this, the design process itself is often thought about and executed without any formal considerations about people.",9
9,"Inevitably the engineer, architect or other designer devotes most of his attention and expertise to devising mechanisms, buildings which support some human activity more effectively than those currently available.",9
10,The new machine or system must not be very different from the old one for a variety of reasons.,9
11,"The old one did its job, not perfectly but well enough to justify its existence.",9
12,The new one is usually designed on the basis of copying the old one but removing as many as possible of the faults.,9
13,"There are other reasons commonality of components and, , shortage of imagination which lead to most design and development being a progressive iterative process.",9
14,This happens to suit the human operators because most of their skills will transfer along the line of development of the machines and systems.,9
15,From the engineering point of view the hardware technology is central and the operators tag along supporting the activity of machines which are basically doing the work.,9
16,"In nineteenth century transport , the coach and horses was not a serious competitor for the steam-engined train, nor was the man with a spade as productive as the operator with a steam shovel.",9
17,This was the earliest technology in which power was derived from sources animal muscles and the output was so obviously superior that men did not mind putting up with the inconvenience of machines which were uncomfortable or awkward to use.,9
18,They even took pride in developing new skills which enabled them to use difficult machines which inexperienced people could not  use.,9
19,"This attitude was reinforced by the second wave of technology which provided instrumentation, ways of sensing and recording data which gave more accurate and reliable data than that which can be detected directly by the human senses.",9
20,At this stage the typical machine operator manipulated machine controls on the basis of data presented on instruments.,9
21,The machine controls caused power to be applied and consequences to occur which resulted in changed readings on the instruments.,9
22,"The man was in the control loop (Hick and Bates, 1950).",9
23,"More recently, in the third wave of technology the man has been removed from the responsibility for continuous control (this is best done by computers working to a moderately flexible range of programs) but he remains as the monitor of the system performance and a selector of the appropriate program determined by the changing short-term objectives.",9
24,He may keep the responsibility for setting-up and shutting-down the system or this also may be partially delegated to computers.,9
25,"This is the ‘Supervisory Control’ role (Sheridan and Johannsen, 1976).",9
26,Information flow in these three phases of development of system control is shown in fig. 1.1,9
27,"Supervisory control is universal, in fact it remains restricted to high technology systems aircraft, computer controlled machine tools, chemical plants and power stations.",9
28,"(Edwards and Lees, 1974).",9
29,"There are still many systems where the man is in the control loop, in vehicle driving and in most manufacturing production processes.",9
30,"There are many tasks where the operator is assisted only by hand-tools and simple powered machines, in craft-work and surgery.",9
31,"There are also plenty of tasks, although these are now perhaps more common in leisure than in paid work, where the man supplies the muscle power, the manual labourer and the active sportsman.",9
32,", the working man may function at any level from the senior partner in high technology operations to the provider of muscle power in physically demanding jobs.",9
33,In all cases the ergonomic requirement is that the task as designed should make use of his abilities and be adaptive to his limitations.,9
34,The human contribution in high technology systems,9
35,"All working systems, including those incorporating advanced technology of processes and process control, depend on skilled operators.",9
36,"There are social, economic and technical reasons for this.",9
37,Socially the public will not easily accept automatic systems.,9
38,When seeking reassurance that a system is safe they study the people who are responsible for it.,9
39,"They have no means of assessing the reliability of automatic control systems but they can make some assessment of a skilled individual and without  knowing very much about his working procedures they will trust his actions if he seems calm, competent and mature.",9
40,The most direct example is the nervous airline passenger who is comforted by the belief that the middle-aged pilot he saw sitting on the flight deck is flying the aeroplane.,9
41,"Less directly but equally importantly, people living in the vicinity of a large plant would not take kindly to the idea that it was not under the control of human beings who are on the spot and are assumed to know exactly what is happening.",9
42,"Economically it remains true that it is inordinately expensive to construct a system which must continue to be reliable without direct human intervention, under the sea or in space.",9
43,"Equally it is expensive to ensure that equipment will continue to function under rough handling conditions, the necessary ‘ruggedising’ of military equipment.",9
44,A system can be designed much more economically if it can be assumed that skilled personnel are available to control and take care of it.,9
45,"Technically the state of the art seems to be that systems are most efficient, reliable and safe when control is largely automatic but the human operator remains in a monitoring and supervisory role.",9
46,", continuous dynamic dealing with minor perturbations is automatic and so also is the application of basic rules about safety; , the system or some part of it might be programmed to go through a step-change function a shut-down if certain parameters exceed prescribed limits.",9
47,The role of the human operator in these circumstances is largely specified by operating instructions which are mandatory.,9
48,Given this and this — he must do that.,9
49,"Characteristically his intervention in this way is a response to some other human requirement; , a maintenance man may wish to have a particular sub-system shut down for his attention or a user of the system product may wish to receive a different input to meet his purposes.",9
50,Many of these interactions could be made automatic were it not for the basic need for a human presence for the social/ economic reasons mentioned above and because the human operator has to act as the ultimate back-stop when things go badly wrong.,9
51,"Things go badly wrong when there has been some extreme untoward event a fire, an earthquake or a bomb, alternatively an unanticipated combination of faults may occur within the plant itself.",9
52,In either case the human intervention must be a very high level one based on complex diagnosis and innovative design-type thinking about how best to cope to avoid a catastrophe.,9
53,A catastrophe can happen when the system energy is channelled as intended by the designers or because there is a release of toxic substances or both.,9
54,The demands on the operator stem from two kinds of task which are not compatible because they require very different levels of skill.,9
55,On the one hand he must cope with routines where the demand is for precise obedience to  established instructions and on the other hand he might suddenly be faced with a need to respond in a creative manner totally outside any instructions.,9
56,"Superficially the solution would seem to be to have two kinds of operators, those who carry out the routines and others who are on call should unforeseen emergencies arise.",9
57,There are two snags about this approach.,9
58,"Firstly there may not be time or it may not be physically possible to suddenly introduce a high level operator, we cannot put a different pilot on the flight deck when an aircraft gets into trouble.",9
59,"Secondly, the high level operator will not maintain his skill and familiarity with the system unless he operates regularly within it.",9
60,His ability to intervene effectively must be a function of his ‘hands on’ experience supported by his conceptual knowledge of how the system functions.,9
61,"This last proposition is based on experience of systems where the intervention requires complex manipulative activity, a surgeon dealing with an emergency during an operation or an aircraft pilot taking over manually.",9
62,It is not so obviously true where the intervention takes the form essentially of a decision to initiate a single direct action closing a particular valve or starting up a stand-by pump.,9
63,In these circumstances it is not clear the effectiveness of the intervention is quite so dependent on operating experience.,9
64,"Taking the nuclear power plant control room, the question is whether the desk operators should be expected to cope with all emergencies which appear within the total information presentation or whether, for complex and dangerous situations, a more senior person the shift-charge engineer should be called upon to make the decisions.",9
65,This policy issue must be cleared before the basic personnel decisions about selection and training of staff at the various levels can be made and before the information presentations can be designed.,9
66,The human contribution in low technology systems,9
67,The extreme case of man as a source of muscle power is dealt with in the previous book in this series —.,9
68,Such working situations are now relatively rare in developed countries and the man is more usually employed in tasks where there is a considerable control element requiring extensive information processing.,9
69,Such tasks range from the use of simple hand tools to tracking using complex powered machinery.,9
70,Human beings are needed for those tasks for a variety of reasons from their highly dexterous manipulative potential through to their ability to accept informal instructions.,9
71,These reasons are given in detail in the discussion of man-machine function allocation (p. 35).,9
72,The demands on the human operator are difficult to quantify or even to describe because the process is essentially an interactive one.,9
73,The skilled operator is working in harmony with his tools and machines.,9
74,"The concept of ‘demand’ is often not appropriate because it implies confrontation, the process is more aptly considered as one of cooperation and persuasion.",9
75,"The human operator is pursuing an objective, usually to make something or to go somewhere, and he achieves this with the assistance of the hardware at his disposal.",9
76,"This hardware, if it is well-designed, aids him in his progress toward his objective.",9
77,"There may be demands in the sense that there are always obstacles to be overcome but these stem from the nature and the variability of the situation he is in; , the materials he has to deal with or the environment he has to move through.",9
78,The skilled operator will aim for efficient performance.,9
79,"Efficiency incorporates not only quantity and quality of achievement but also preservation of his own safety and health and that of others who might be involved as working partners, passengers or the general public in the neighbourhood.",9
80,", if his tasks are badly designed they may well make unnecessary demands.",9
81,These begin with bodily aspects of the operating posture required and the forces which must be exerted to operate controls.,9
82,"for a work-space which is used full-time very slight departures from the optimum may lead to problems in the long term, in strained ligaments, tendons and muscles.",9
83,Posture is constrained not only by the physical dimensions of the work-space but also by the need to be in a position to see certain events and to feel others through control operations or machine movement.,9
84,"Other demands will arise if the information presented is inadequate in content, e.g. poor lighting may make it difficult to detect some relevant cues, or in structure, e.g. poor coding and presentation of information on dials, charts or screens.",9
85,Correspondingly there may be output demands created by control operations which result in things happening too quickly or unexpectedly.,9
86,The level of demand is to do not only with the tasks as they are done but also with the duration for which they must continue to be done.,9
87,This applies particularly to routines and repetitive work where the main operator limitation is not capacity or skill but stamina.,9
88,"In principle, repetitive work is best left to automatic machines but the flexibility of human performance is often needed because slight changes are required either to modify the product or to cope with different materials.",9
89,Batch production work is often of this kind and it is as unchanging or boring as it might appear to the casual visitor to the factory.,9
90,"In all the clothing trades there are continuous changes in sizes, materials, colours, styles which provide the appropriate variety for  the customers and incidentally for the producer.",9
91,Work design must take account of the needs of the consumer those of the worker.,9
92,Ergonomics and other aspects of technology,9
93,The technical specialist who represents the people point of view implicit in the approach just described is the ergonomist.,9
94,In the previous book in this series the relationship of ergonomics to other aspects or kinds of technology was discussed in detail.,9
95,The unique feature of ergonomics is its emphasis on the characteristics of human operators and their relevance to the design of work.,9
96,The role of the ergonomist is essentially an advisory one.,9
97,In the case of high technology design he must provide a service for the engineers and scientists who carry the technical design responsibility.,9
98,This service may simply be as a source of information or the ergonomist can have more power the design decisions involving people have to be approved by him.,9
99,"This is usually restricted to obvious cases of man-machine interaction the design of displays, controls and work-spaces.",9
100,In the case of low technology design again he has an advisory role but with a general emphasis on awareness of the kinds and ranges of people who are being catered for.,9
101,for systems which are already operating the ergonomist is likely to cooperate with occupational health and safety specialists and to play a part in the consideration of accidents and occupational diseases which might arise from unnecessarily stressful work situations (p. 294).,9
102,It will be appreciated that for most kinds of work and most working organisations it is not feasible to employ specialist ergonomists.,9
103,In such cases those who have responsibilities for work design need to have some awareness of the principles of ergonomics.,9
104,The philosophy of work,9
105,"Ergonomics is sometimes confused by questions , who is the ergonomist servicing — the employer or the worker? or, to whom is he ultimately responsible — the state, the employer, the producer or the consumer? fortunately it is possible to dispose of these issues without taking up any particular political position.",9
106,"Ergonomics seems to flourish equally well in capitalist and socialist/communist systems, ergonomics activity can be sponsored with equal validity by employers organisations and by workers organisations.",9
107,"This is because, as already mentioned, ergonomics is about efficient use of people.",9
108,"There can be no good reason to object to this when it is recognised that efficiency incorporates personal factors safety, health and quality of  working life system factors productivity and quality of work.",9
109,"There is rarely any conflict in that good ergonomics is the objectives of the worker, the employer and the consumer or customer.",9
110,"There are sometimes larger issues of whether what the system does is acceptable or not, in weapon systems, and the ergonomist as a citizen will have his own opinion on these matters but the ergonomist as an ergonomist is confined to questions of efficiency.",9
111,There is an underlying necessary ethic which is best summarised as the social contract.,9
112,"An individual is a member of a community from which he obtains considerable benefits, in return he develops special skills which he applies for the benefit of the community.",9
113,The application of special skills in this way is called work.,9
114,The ergonomist has to believe that work is a good thing and that to conduct it efficiently is always better than to conduct it inefficiently.,9
115,The design of systems.,9
116,The system concept,9
117,"A system is a set of interacting parts which has meaning as a whole because it is possible to define a purpose — a reason why the parts are seen to be related to the whole and a justification for the concept of the whole (Singleton, 1974).",9
118,"Thus, systems theory is essentially teleological — explanations are consequences causes.",9
119,"The parts may themselves be complex and may be conceived as having their own subsidiary purposes in confluence with the system purpose, these are sub-systems.",9
120,The system in turn is part of a larger complex — the parent system.,9
121,"Thus, systems are hierarchical and at each level the unit is considered as a functional a physical entity.",9
122,"The systems approach is often a convenient way of looking at human behaviour either internally — this is man as a set of sub-systems or the man interacting with mechanisms — man-machine systems, or man interacting with organisations — socio-technical systems.",9
123,The enormous flexibility of the systems approach has its penalties in potential confusion the highly variable relationship between functional and physical entities.,9
124,"Sometimes this relationship is fairly close; , in the nervous system, the endocrine system, the digestive system , and sometimes it remains almost entirely unknown, , the perceptual system and the decision-making system.",9
125,"These last two are obviously each related to the nervous system and to the brain but not necessarily to a particular part of the brain and taken together they overlap in such obscure ways that they are best regarded as sub-systems in different domains, one can talk one or the other but not both simultaneously.",9
126,"Systems theory is a useful way of identifying complex entities, particularly  those which have a functional unity and of talking about relationships but it remains at some level of abstraction from reality.",9
127,", to solve any design problem there has at some stage to be a switch from systems thinking to thinking physical entities because these are the things that can be created, precisely located and manipulated in the real world.",9
128,"Nevertheless, there are enormous dividends in being able to discuss functions independently of physical mechanisms and to explain relationships without being restricted to established and readily observable physical connections or separations.",9
129,", thinking of a power station as a way of translating energy from fuel into electric power enables the designer to consider various options.",9
130,Should the fuel be of a fossil type coal or oil or should it be the radioactive elements in a nuclear reaction?,9
131,"When the heat has appeared how best should it be taken away — by pressurised water, by steam, by liquid sodium or by carbon dioxide?",9
132,"This heat has to be turned into mechanical energy, currently always by a steam turbine and the mechanical energy in a rotating shaft is then translated by a generator into electricity.",9
133,The losses in this transfer of energy from one form to another can be calculated and the flow through the various sub-systems can be traced.,9
134,The initial consideration of the power station as an energy processing system aids design discussions about the relative advantages and limitations of various mechanisms and their performance in practice.,9
135,As the system operates it has to be controlled.,9
136,The control of the flow of energy is partly through automatic servomechanisms and partly through human operations.,9
137,The design problem of which does what is also best thought about initially in system terms.,9
138,"Distinct from the flow of energy the designer is, at this stage, thinking about the flow of information.",9
139,Energy and information are processed by systems and sub-systems.,9
140,"In these terms, the human operator is a particular sub-system.",9
141,Mechanical devices and human operators are not comparable physically beyond the mundane level of size but they are comparable as different sub-systems whose performance can be described and assessed the common metrics of energy and information.,9
142,Hence the importance of systems concepts to ergonomics.,9
143,If the human operator is to control functions within other sub-systems he must receive information about the system state through a man-machine interface.,9
144,This interface takes its physical form in the control room.,9
145,"The control room is part of the communications channel between the human operators and the mechanisms and its design, as a man-machine interface, is one of the key ergonomics problems in power stations.",9
146,Office organisations also can be considered as systems.,9
147,"There will be certain physical mechanisms telephones, typewriters and computers but the flow of energy is trivial and the interest centres entirely on the flow of  information.",9
148,"Consider, , a travel office.",9
149,There is a vast amount of information available either in printed form or through computer networks.,9
150,The objectives are to help members of the public to find their way through this information store and to transmit their orders for particular journeys or holidays to the providers of those services.,9
151,"The manager or designer of the office has to consider the various sub-systems he requires; one for dealing with enquiries, one for handling money, one for receiving new information, one for confirming orders .",9
152,The interface between the public and the information store is a counter manned by people.,9
153,The counter assistants are parts of the interface.,9
154,Information is exchanged verbally and through written documentation.,9
155,In this kind of office the variety of requests for service is probably such that it would be necessary to provide a set of categories of the main kinds of activities or functions.,9
156,It would then be possible to devise the appropriate system for presenting the required information.,9
157,It is a very different situation from a power station control room but nevertheless the same principles of starting by the analysis of the required information apply.,9
158,"The power station, the travel office and all other man-made systems have the employment of people sub-systems are required which are associated with personnel functions.",9
159,"It is necessary to attract and select staff, to train them, to provide them with various services and with potentiality for advancement as their skills increase with experience.",9
160,The design of tasks is the common ground between personnel activities training and engineering activities workplace design.,9
161,Consideration of people in system terms provides the possibility of generalisations which apply across great varieties of physical and intellectual activities.,9
162,The resulting knowledge is the content of ergonomics.,9
163,Fig. 1.2 shows the outline of the systems design process in a way which emphasises the parallel roles of the engineer and the ergonomist concerned respectively with the design of the hardware and the personnel sub-systems and their common design problems of allocation of function and interface design.,9
164,The design of high technology systems,9
165,"The insertion of an adequate Human factors approach into a comprehensive design process is not easy, partly for the reason mentioned already that it has not habitually been regarded as necessary and partly because it cuts across all other decision-making.",9
166,"The Human Factors specialist can rightly be accused of wanting to have a finger in every pie because, as he sees it, behavioural considerations do affect every design decision.",9
167,"If ergonomics was confined to, say, the determination of the physical dimensions of the work-space then it would be more readily accepted by traditional designers, but the  broad claim that ergonomics has a contribution to make to every design and operational aspect which involves the behaviour of people is a proposition which it is much more difficult for an engineer or other designer to digest (fig. 1.3).",9
168,The questions begin with the formulation of the design objectives.,9
169,What are   the human requirements which the new product or process is intended to meet and how far are they not met by those already available?,9
170,"This would normally be regarded as a matter for economists and market-research specialists but behind the formidable array of evidence which they will generate are more fundamental questions of consumer preference, customer requirements which are matters of human needs and prejudices.",9
171,Competent market research should cover these aspects but the ergonomist can remind the policy-makers that such evidence is needed and that it should be acquired by studies of people which are properly conducted.,9
172,If the evidence is favourable then the next step will be to set up a design team containing members covering the relevant range of expertise.,9
173,"How much design effort is needed in the different areas will not be clear at this stage but unless the system is very simple there are bound to be problems of overlap and of how far to arrange sub-teams by discipline, by function or by problem (Singleton, 1987).",9
174,The usual compromise is that there should be problem-orientated sub-teams but with additional support available from discipline-orientated specialists.,9
175,If these latter are part of the design team then already we have a matrix organisation but they may well be provided on a service basis from some other part of the parent organisation.,9
176,Difficulties will emerge later unless considerable thought is given at this stage to the appropriate range of skills required and the consequent problems of interdisciplinary communication.,9
177,The art of good sub-system design is to identify problem areas where work can proceed relatively independently of other areas the need for intercommunication is minimised.,9
178,There will always be the need for some intercommunication and the appropriate interfaces should be provided.,9
179,"Nevertheless, if committees, working parties and task forces begin to proliferate within the design team, this is a sure indication that the basic allocation into sub-systems was not optimal.",9
180,Communication should be mainly through the central command and control centre which may be no larger than the project leader and his small personal staff as may be a group of heads of sub-systems or both.,9
181,These issues are discussed from another viewpoint in Chapter 3 (p. 140).,9
182,The analysis of required skills ought in principle to have an ergonomics input but in practice it is usually done on the basis of experience of similar system designs in the past.,9
183,"There can be a useful discussion between the project leader and an ergonomist where the former is invited to clarify how he sees these intercommunication problems being dealt with including such criteria as what is reported to him, what to the meeting of sub-heads and what occurs directly between sub-teams.",9
184,"Organisational rules of this kind can be very helpful in steering between the excessive information flow, e.g. memoranda copied to many people, and excessive unilateralism, e.g. refusing further discussion after the issue of formal documents.",9
185,"Having allocated the human and other resources needed for the overall design task it is then appropriate to develop a more detailed model of the system functions materials, energy and information flow.",9
186,Most designers have an intuitive but unformalised picture in these terms but it is of great utility to produce these pictures in flow diagram form any differences of view are revealed and can be reconciled by discussions during the process of agreeing the diagrams.,9
187,When there are a number of individuals or groups from different disciplines and pursuing different objectives within some overall specification it is  obviously crucial that all their activities should be the common goal.,9
188,"To this end, it is necessary that there should be intercommunication not only about particular design decisions but also about underlying philosophies the ultimate system is conceptually as well as operationally coherent.",9
189,Sometimes this is achieved by a dominant project leader who imposes his own philosophy and then makes many of the decisions leaving only detailing for team members.,9
190,"In recent times it is more usual to have some element of discussion, partly the increasingly democratic style of organisations and partly because the variety of relevant technology requires a correspondingly wide range of expertise.",9
191,In any case there is a need for widespread intercommunication which may be mainly informal but requires some formality to ensure that clashes of attitude do not delay or distort decisions and to make sure also that finalised decisions are unambiguously recorded.,9
192,"If this intercommunication is not properly arranged there will be the familiar symptoms of frustrating reiteration, decisions being misunderstood or being constantly revised, political manoeuvring and even concealment of progress within one or more of the teams.",9
193,As the overall design progresses the information storage system becomes increasingly important.,9
194,"If insufficient attention has been devoted to the design of this and also the related access procedures the symptoms are a plethora of documentation which no individual entirely understands, the temptation to do it again waste time finding out how something has already been done and too much reliance on the human memory.",9
195,The behavioural symptoms of inadequate organisation of design teams are summarised in Table 1.1.,9
196,As the system is made more definitive by the selection of particular physical mechanisms there should be parallel activity in the consideration of how these things are to be used and maintained by the human operator.,9
197,Note that the philosophy here is that all the hardware is ultimately an extension of and a support for human functions.,9
198,"This is the concept of all systems as human beings with various kinds of engineering aids (Singleton, 1967a).",9
199,functions are delegated from the human operator allocated to him.,9
200,This extreme ergonomics stance serves as an antidote to the equally extreme engineering approach in which systems are regarded basically as hardware which for reasons of economic or technological limitations have to depend occasionally on some human performance.,9
201,there is no dependence on human performance in the on-line operational mode it is bound to exist in the maintenance mode.,9
202,"In either case, there will eventually be a need for the consideration of the kinds of human operators required and how they are to be selected and trained.",9
203,Traditionally these personnel functions were regarded as quite separate from   design functions and indeed they were often left until the hardware design and commissioning was virtually complete.,9
204,"The essence of the systems approach is that personnel decisions should proceed in parallel with engineering decisions, partly to economise on development time and partly to provide scope for trade-offs.",9
205,One factor which has given renewed emphasis to this need for cooperation is the increased use of simulation (p. 128).,9
206,Simulators were originally considered to be training devices but their use is now extending into other fields personnel assessment and as aids to the design of the information interfaces.,9
207,It used to be considered that simulator specifications could only be proposed when the on-line system design had been completed but there are considerable advantages in developing the simulator before the on-line system it becomes a dynamic mock-up of the real situation.,9
208,Detailed evaluations can be carried out on this mock-up before the real system is constructed.,9
209,All systems are constructed from bought-in components which may themselves be complex enough to warrant a human factors evaluation.,9
210,", a motor/pump system may well have its own controls, there will be standard maintenance procedures and there will be an operation/maintenance manual.",9
211,All of these can be assessed from the point of view of clarity of presentation and ease of use.,9
212,"The system being constructed will require its own operating instructions, maintenance procedures and perhaps safety regulations.",9
213,The design and preparation of this documentation has a Human factors component.,9
214,"It is a matter of storage, access to and presentation of information.",9
215,Even at the design stage it is useful also to recognise that all this material will require procedures for updating experience,9
216,Finally it must be accepted that technological and operational expertise is never complete.,9
217,The operators of plant are bound to discover by experience aspects of the design which could be improved.,9
218,There should be a mechanism for feeding this information back to the designers the succeeding system designs will avoid these problems.,9
219,", human performance within systems is impossible to predict with any precision and details of this performance as it occurs in practice or on simulators is the only basis for prediction on matters safety and system reliability either for the current system or for future systems.",9
220,Potential human factors inputs to the large scale design process are summarised in fig. 1.4.,9
221,In all behavioural matters and indeed in many technical matters also it is important to avoid the impression that when operations in practice contain undesirable features not predicted by designers then the designers have made mistakes.,9
222,This may be true in a formal sense but allocation of blame is not usually a productive exercise particularly from a learning view-point.,9
223,"It is valuable to inculcate the attitude that everyone learns, , design and operating staff all improve on the basis of experience with feed-back.",9
224,The exposure and remedy of facets of systems performance which are not entirely as predicted is in everyone's interest.,9
225,One example of this is matters to do with safety: it is always useful to collect ‘critical incident’ data accident data as one part of the feed-back about system performances.,9
226,The setting up of routines for this communication is another aspect of ergonomics.,9
227,"In summary, although the basic contribution of the ergonomist is to the design of information interfaces these interfaces extend far beyond the man-machine interface found in the control room.",9
228,"They include the documentation of the design itself, communication within the design team, between designers and suppliers and between designers and operators (fig. 1.5).",9
229,"The operations staff include those who set it up, those who control it during operations, those who maintain it, and eventually those who have to dismantle it.",9
230,To give one example of the size of the documentation problem it is not unusual for a large process plant to have two or three hundred volumes of instructions.,9
231,"These include the operating instructions, the maintenance instructions, the suppliers' instruction manuals, the safety regulations and instructions for particular emergencies.",9
232,The design of smaller systems,9
233,"The design of a machine or device which is assigned as an aid for one person will not usually encounter the problems associated with elaborate design teams just described, but nevertheless some human factors sensitivity will help to provide a better product.",9
234,This can be important not only from the point of view of efficiency in design and use but also in improving the sales appeal.,9
235,It is increasingly common for advertisements to emphasise features ‘man-machine harmony’ or ‘user friendliness’.,9
236,The implication is that ergonomics has been properly applied.,9
237,There is a need for formal ergonomics in any design where the designer himself is not an experienced user.,9
238,"Some hand tools are beautifully designed to match the user, e.g. the two-handed scythe.",9
239,In these cases it is clear that the design developed by constant trial in practice.,9
240,"There are others, however, where even after centuries of use this matching is not obviously satisfactory, violin playing would seem to be posturally a disaster, but there may be some subtle aids to very precise control of the sound generated in having the source of sound very close to the ear and perhaps some vibration transmission by the direct contact of this instrument and the jawbone.",9
241,Ergonomics is concerned with the transmission of information.,9
242,"for modest design enterprises information exchange is needed between the designer and the potential user, between the designer and the producer and between the designer/producer and the customer/actual user (Fig. 1.6).",9
243,The designer needs to know about the tasks which his new device is intended to aid and also about the kind of person who will use it.,9
244,"Clearly, designing for fit young men in the armed forces has different constraints from designing for middle-aged female workers in manufacturing.",9
245,"Some of the required   information may be susceptible to precise description in numerical terms body size and strength, but most of it will be of the ‘awareness’ kind when the designer recognises broadly that particular kinds of people have particular advantages and limitations.",9
246,"Similarly the range of tasks for which the device is required may not be known in the kind of detail which is available from comprehensive task descriptions but the designer will consider the extremes of what it is likely to be used for and the environment in which it will be used, designing a machine-tool for use in a factory has different requirements from designing a powered garden tool where the user could be wearing heavy gloves, will not be wearing safety-boots and will not receive any formal training.",9
247,"Communication between the designer and the producer used to be done almost entirely by traditional engineering drawings but there is now a tendency to use sketches, schematic drawings, photographs and models including computer-based models, complicated shapes in three dimensions are difficult to represent as rectangular projections and are not easily interpreted.",9
248,Communication with the customer/user takes the form of operating instructions which are contained in an instruction book.,9
249,"The design of this book, booklet or even leaflet is a much neglected art and is frequently very badly executed — hence the common attitude reflected in the aphorism ‘when all else fails try reading the instructions’.",9
250,"The most common failings are to rely too much on words extensively labelled diagrams, to use technical terms and concepts which the user may not understand, to focus on what it is at the expense of what it does and to fail to separate the needs of the operator from the details which are needed to set up the device, to locate faults, to provide remedies and to provide routine maintenance.",9
251,An extended booklet should have a very good index or other access system to the information.,9
252,"The designer is not the person to evaluate the clarity and usability of instructions, a sample of actual users will provide a much better assessment.",9
253,further details are given on p. 76.,9
254,The design of macro-systems,9
255,The larger systems which make up communities and nations are currently in a state of flux the impact of technology.,9
256,The provision of such a variety of telecommunication and travel facilities makes it impossible for any community however large or small to develop in isolation.,9
257,The consequence is an increasingly standardised way of life or aspirations towards a particular way of life across the world.,9
258,The differences which remain are enforced mainly by differences in average income and in style of government.,9
259,Technology continues to change jobs with consequent changes in ways  of life and it also changes life-expectation which has profound effects on all communities.,9
260,"However, just as hardware systems are dominated by engineering thinking, macro-systems are dominated by economic thinking.",9
261,There is excessive reliance on the adaptability of people who are required to adjust to whatever is dictated by economic and technological policies.,9
262,"Politicians in all countries would accept the proposition that the system should be designed to serve the people but whatever the political philosophy behind the system, the people always seem to be more its servants than its masters.",9
263,Economic issues are real enough and it is often pointed out that politics is about priorities.,9
264,The priorities are assessed on the basis of evidence and unfortunately evidence about people is not so readily quantified as evidence about financial and physical resources.,9
265,The result is that systems at every level from the state to the small company are evaluated and policies are developed which are not sufficiently orientated to the needs and aspirations of the people within the system.,9
266,This is a very large issue mostly beyond the scope of this book except to note that ergonomics is an exemplar of a style of thinking which is based on characteristics of people.,9
267,Ergonomics can be defined as systems design with the attributes of people as the frame of reference.,9
268,"Although the human operator is for many purposes within ergonomics appropriately considered as a mere information processing device, any design issue must be considered in the context that these human operators are individuals and citizens within communities.",9
269,"What they believe, what they want, what they like, what they dislike and whether they work efficiently or not are determined by the societal context by the physical environment.",9
270,It is therefore appropriate to bear in mind the position and trends in human resources in the community of which the workers are members.,9
271,"For such macro-systems, the principle that the designer produces what he thinks the users need is being replaced by the principle that the users themselves decide what they want and the professionals assist them in designing as specified by the users.",9
272,"This approach generates another duty for designers and ergonomists, to present to the users an array of possible options which will aid their discussions and choices.",9
273,Knowledge,9
274,Demographic data,9
275,"Currently there are about 4.5 billion people in the world, 1 billion in the developed world and 3.5 billion in the developing world (Table 1.2).",9
276,This puts a correct perspective on the contents of this book which are mainly concerned with technologically-based societies although there is a section in   Chapter 3 on ergonomics in developing countries.,9
277,Most of the evidence and experience reported here has been derived from the 16% of the world population living in Europe and North America.,9
278,"The two worlds differ markedly in the distribution of populations, developed countries have about 65% of the population in the economically active age range from 15–64 years, about 25% under 15 and the remaining 10% in retirement.",9
279,This last group is still increasing quite rapidly.,9
280,The retired group is much smaller in developing countries where about 55% are in the economically active age range and more than 40% are under 15.,9
281,Life expectation at  birth is about 45 years in developing countries and 70 years in developed countries.,9
282,The longer life expectation of females is more marked in the developed countries (Table 1.3).,9
283,"The age distribution of the working population for two countries, one developed and one developing, which happen to have the same sized labour force is shown in fig. 1.7.",9
284,West Germany has a greater proportion of people economically active but they start work later and retire earlier than do workers in Pakistan.,9
285,"There are about 4 million research and development scientists and engineers in the world, 3.5 million in developed countries and 0.5 million in developing countries, almost all this latter 0.5 million are in Asia, the numbers in Latin America and Africa are very small (UNESCO statistical year book).",9
286,The differences in various amenities are shown in Table 1.4.,9
287,"The energy consumption is about 100 units (kg of coal equivalent per person) in a developing country and about 10000 units in Europe and the U.S.A. This is affected by the fact that developing countries mostly have tropical or sub-tropical climates while developed countries are in the temperate zone, but there is a similar difference of about 100: 1 in income per head between the rich countries and the poor countries ().",9
288,"Within any country the Human Resource situation can be approached by this basic division into the ‘economically active’ and others who, for one reason or another, are supported by the workers.",9
289,"Those supported include young children, students, retired persons, seriously disabled persons, people living on independent means and, somewhat unfairly, women doing domestic work.",9
290,The numbers and proportions of those economically active in a sample of developed countries are shown in Table 1.5.,9
291,It will be seen that in each country this economically active group is about half the total population.,9
292,for males the proportion is usually about 55% and for females about 45%.,9
293,"A very large economy the U.S.A. has 100 million workers, the large European countries have about 25 million workers.",9
294,Japan is about half-way between with about 60 million workers.,9
295,The smaller European countries have 5 million workers.,9
296,Workers in this sense are a country's Human Resource which is deployed for the benefit of the community generally.,9
297,The primary need of any person or population is water and food and in primitive societies the supply of these commodities will absorb the effort of almost all the workforce.,9
298,As food supplies improve it is possible to move some of the Human Resource into construction and manufacturing.,9
299,In the U.K. the concentration on manufacturing in the nineteenth century was balanced by the importing of food.,9
300,"France, by contrast, had a smaller manufacturing base but remained self-sufficient in food the dramatic fall of proportion of   workers in primary industries did not occur until after World War II (fig. 1.8).",9
301,In the U.S.A. even at the time of President Lincoln about 1860 there was serious debate whether the economy should remain agricultural or whether there should be a positive attempt to develop manufacturing.,9
302,In India the total population is currently about 665 million of which 244 million (37%) are economically active.,9
303,"153 million are engaged in agriculture and fishing, that is 63% of the working population (I.L.O.",9
304,data).,9
305,"In the U.K. less than 3% of the working population are now employed in agriculture, in most advanced countries this figure is now well below 10%, as illustrated in fig. 1.9.",9
306,This also shows that the predominant way of earning a living in a developed country  now is in the service industries.,9
307,fig. 1.,9
308,10 shows the current distribution of U.K. Human Resources.,9
309,"The former basic industries — mining, agriculture, construction and manufacturing — now employ about a third of the total workforce.",9
310,"In manufacturing between 1980 and 1985 output measured per person-hour or per person employed increased by about 25% but the total   output remained roughly constant, that is the manufacturing labour force is still falling rapidly (1985).",9
311,Some consequences of these trends are discussed in more detail in Singleton and Crawley (1980).,9
312,"From the end of World War II to the early 1970s there was virtually full employment in developed countries, but in the last ten years the position has changed considerably as shown in fig. 1.11.",9
313,"Ireland it would seem that the smaller European countries have contained the situation better than have the larger ones, but this is an artefact since other small countries Belgium, Netherlands and Denmark follow the same trend as the larger countries.",9
314,It should be noted that the trend of an increase in unemployment from about 5% to about 10% over ten years is sufficiently general to indicate that it is not a function of the style of government.,9
315,These data for countries do not reveal considerable underlying differences within countries.,9
316,"In England , unemployment in the North is twice that in the South-East, and in most European countries there are lesser employment opportunities in rural   areas urban areas resulting in depopulation of the countryside and an increase in the size of cities.",9
317,This trend is even more marked in developing countries.,9
318,Human resource utilisation,9
319,This brief excursion into the complex field of labour statistics is intended to illustrate the following points which are relevant to the theory and practice of ergonomics.,9
320,1.,9
321,"Since the beginnings of technology, now about 200 years ago in the case of the U.K., the labour market has been in a continuous state of flux.",9
322,2.,9
323,"The overall shift has not been so much from agriculture to manufacturing but rather a steady rise in the service industries, and a fall in primary industries.",9
324,3.,9
325,"The manufacturing labour force in developed countries is now in   accelerating decline as productivity and the investment per worker increases, this is resulting in a further increase in service industries and an increase in unemployment.",9
326,4.,9
327,There are considerable differences between the problems of so-called developed and developing countries.,9
328,This dichotomy is useful but is an oversimplification; degree of development as measured by income per head or technology utilisation is best described by a continuous scale.,9
329,A particular country is at one point on that scale at one time by one measure.,9
330,5.,9
331,Accelerating technological development has pushed the government of every country off-balance in the past decade.,9
332,This is illustrated in developed countries by the increase in unemployment which is fundamentally a failure to properly utilise the total Human Resource.,9
333,"In developing countries there are many contrasts in that high technology (airlines, nuclear power, information systems; etc.) exists in small pockets alongside the still unresolved traditional problems of inadequate nutrition and health.",9
334,6.,9
335,Ergonomics also is pushed off-balance because the variety of human work increases in parallel with technology.,9
336,"The traditional problems of heat stress and physical work-load remain, particularly in the developing countries, while new problems appear as more complex systems are designed requiring new operator roles and more serious consequences of inadequate performance.",9
337,7.,9
338,Nevertheless technology now provides the possibility of allocating high energy and repetitive work to machines the typical man at work is in a supervising an operating mode.,9
339,8.,9
340,"When machines provide the energy and set the pace the objective of the operator (and consequently of ergonomics) shifts from rates and amounts to quality, reliability and safety.",9
341,9.,9
342,The general concept of work is also shifting from man-machine interaction to man-man interaction with machines as aids.,9
343,10.,9
344,Many of the policy issues are mistakenly addressed in that there is too much emphasis on finding uses for what technology can provide driving technology by the needs of people.,9
345,The behavioural specialists are responsible for providing data and attitudes for the policy-makers which should redress the balance.,9
346,11.,9
347,The economic concept of work is too narrow for ergonomics.,9
348,There are many ergonomics problems in the non-economically active half of the population.,9
349,If ergonomics is regarded as the science of work then work must be defined as purposeful activity merely as activity for economic gain.,9
350,12.,9
351,This brief statistical survey reveals the scale and diversity of problems  associated with the mind at work.,9
352,This is daunting but it is also challenging and stimulating.,9
353,"Principles, methods and procedures",9
354,"Education, work and leisure",9
355,Virtually all human societies have developed the principle that the pattern of personal activity should change with age.,9
356,In the early years there is extensive leisure devoted to play in which the basic manipulative and social skills are developed.,9
357,"There is also more formalised learning through an educational system which concentrates mainly on information processing: reading, writing and arithmetic and more elaborate symbolic and organisational skills.",9
358,When the individual has matured he usually accepts responsibilities for child-rearing and for work.,9
359,"In his declining years the proportion of leisure increases again, sometimes suddenly when he ‘retires’ but preferably gradually as his energies diminish.",9
360,"Thus we can normally expect a mature mind in a person at work and although developmental processes of growth and senescence are of some interest, studies of the person working usually assume that we are dealing with a mind which is equipped with the basic skills derived from play and education but one which has not been any serious diminution of capacity.",9
361,This is not to suggest that the age variable can be ignored.,9
362,It is accepted that ageing is a continuous process from birth to death and there are considerable differences between the average worker in the 25–45 age group and the apparent equivalent in the 46–65 age group.,9
363,The age distribution of a particular workforce can materially affect the problems of work design and training.,9
364,Correspondingly it must be recognised that an individual has entered work with a particular educational standard.,9
365,During his working years he has considerable leisure which is bound to have some interactions with work.,9
366,for approximate computational purposes it is normally assumed in the western world that a full working year is no 200 man-days.,9
367,"The remaining 165 days disappear in week-ends, holidays and absence for training, sickness .",9
368,"There is also a widespread convention that the working day should be 7–8 hours, that is about a third of the total day.",9
369,Thus the full-time worker is in fact working for less than 200% of the total time.,9
370,The distinction between work and leisure and between work and education is an arbitrary one from the point of view of stress on the person.,9
371,", many city office workers regard the main stress of the day as the difficulties in getting from home to work and back again with work as a relatively relaxed period between.",9
372,"Even more strikingly, some working mothers regard a period  at work, particularly if it is part-time, as a welcome respite from the great variety of stresses arising in looking after a home and children.",9
373,"Some of the most exacting university degrees, those in the biological and physical sciences demand a level of work load from the conscientious student which is greater than that expected in most occupations.",9
374,One would expect self-selected leisure activities to be different from and complementary to those at work.,9
375,", the manual labourer is unlikely to take up an energetic hobby cycling and he is likely to spend his holidays relaxing at the seaside walking in the mountains.",9
376,"The young office worker in a safe sedentary job may well take up rock-climbing as a dangerous, physically exacting antidote for the dull occupational part of his life.",9
377,Although it would be convenient scientifically and sometimes personally to regard work as a separable part of a human life this separation is never entirely valid and can be misleading.,9
378,The mind at work is part of the person at work and that same person has many other activities in the past and the future and in parallel which have their interactions with the work.,9
379,"In system jargon, the working world is one sub-system within a complete set of sub-systems which make up the total environment or life space of the individual.",9
380,"To study one sub-system in detail without regard to interactions with the others is usually inadequate, but on the other hand, to try to examine simultaneously the whole complex of sub-systems is to invite disorientation.",9
381,The remedy is a compromise in which activity in one sub-system that which incorporates work is studied but in the context of sensitivity to external influences.,9
382,Systems theory can be applied in many ways to behaviour at work.,9
383,The two main theories emphasise respectively interactions with other people;and interactions with machines;.,9
384,Socio-technical systems,9
385,"In the period of technological innovation following the second world war a group of human relations specialists, working from the Tavistock Institute in London, noted that the social behaviour of workers and their organisational structure in groups and teams was influenced by the technical systems associated with that work.",9
386,"The first studies were in coal mines where there were different degrees of mechanisation associated with the same type of working group and it was also possible to distinguish different social organisations working in similar technical environments (Trist and Murray, 1948).",9
387,"Some groups were organised each worker carried out an independent part-task with little reference to  the total task, whereas in other cases each worker had a commitment to the total task and carried out various sub-tasks in this context.",9
388,"This latter, labelled a ‘composite’ group as distinct from a conventional group, had greater productive achievement and lower absenteeism.",9
389,"More generally, the effectiveness of the production system depends on the way the social system is adjusted to the technical requirements (Emery and Trist, 1960).",9
390,Technological decisions necessarily dominate the design of the system in the sense of how the collective task of transforming inputs into outputs is achieved.,9
391,"Nevertheless, the social system which integrates the activities of the workers and provides the flexibility for relating separate tasks to the needs of the production system as a whole must be considered.",9
392,Hence the concept of the socio-technical system where technical and social requirements are harmonised into one effective organisation.,9
393,"The organisation, like a living organism, maintains a dynamic equilibrium with the environment.",9
394,Thus it is an open system a closed one and its behaviour cannot be understood by simply looking at the relationship between inputs and outputs.,9
395,The adaptability of the enterprise may lie in providing appropriate outputs to match the changes of the market from relatively stable physical inputs or may lie in providing a fixed output with changing sources of inputs.,9
396,"In either case there is no fixed relationship between physical inputs and outputs, the system responds to the environment.",9
397,It follows that one of the main tasks of management is to control the interaction with the environment.,9
398,"The implication also is that, if management has got the technology right within the system design, it should then attend to the environment and should allow, within the internal activities, scope for self-organising into autonomous groups.",9
399,"If, on the contrary, there is a rigid internal separation between the roles of setting standards and meeting standards then conflict has been built into the system (Klein, 1979).",9
400,"This approach can legitimately be regarded as the parent of organisation theory (p. 143), and of the ‘quality of working life’(QWOL), sometimes also called the ‘job design’ movement (Davis and Cherns 1975, Davis and Taylor 1972).",9
401,It provides considerable insight into the eventual difficulties of the early twentieth century mass production methods as exemplified by the moving belt type assembly line.,9
402,On the other hand it does not provide remedies for production problems which can be applied as standard recipes or procedures.,9
403,"Again, the elusive if all-pervading nature of the theme, it is difficult to formalise into legislation on humanising work as several European countries have discovered by experience.",9
404,"It has emerged in many countries that, as the standard of living rises, it is more and more difficult to run an autocratic production system using the  indigenous labour force.",9
405,The first management remedy is to import a more docile labour force from another country or from a less developed part of the same country.,9
406,This is only a temporary solution and there have been many attempts to organise more humane working systems.,9
407,"The danger here is that, although things may be pleasant for the workers, the incentive to work very hard is not so direct and it may not be possible to maintain a competitive position the same industry in a developing country.",9
408,Hence a further development of research on work motivation (p. 144).,9
409,"Taking a more global view, one opinion is that the manufacturing industries should indeed move to developing countries whilst the advanced industries orientate their labour forces toward information and other service industries.",9
410,"There is a trend in this direction (Singleton and Crawley, 1980), but, , it is not the complete answer.",9
411,There are other complications.,9
412,"Robots, , are best suited for the highly repetitive manufacturing tasks which are the ones least suited to human efforts robotisation can cure some of the ills of mass production.",9
413,"Looking at the environment, as market demands become more sophisticated so there is a need for operator flexibility in production system outputs, which has its counterpart in greater variety of work within the production system (Lupton and Tanner, 1980).",9
414,"Socio-technical system theory has been highly fruitful in generating other academic lines of development: organisation theory, quality of working life concepts and work motivation, in stimulating many innovations in production organisation and in provoking governments to consider legislation in matters humanisation of work (Germany) and co-determination at work (Sweden).",9
415,"Paradoxically it has not developed a formalised set of principles or immutable knowledge which could, , be structured into an academic text-book about socio-technical systems.",9
416,"The problem seems to be that it is fundamentally about attitudes to work and such attitudes are an inextricable and non-monotonic range of influences not only from work itself, with all the pressures of technological change, but also from prevailing economic, social and cultural changes in the community generally.",9
417,Man-machine systems,9
418,Work is very rarely performed by a man without the aid of some machinery and correspondingly machines rarely function for very long without human intervention.,9
419,Man and machine can be regarded as sub-systems each making a distinctive contribution towards the achievement of the purposes of the working system.,9
420,The system itself can be described as a set of functions necessary for the overall purpose.,9
421,The emphasis on defining the system its purposes or objectives and analysing it its functions are the characteristics of the systems approach.,9
422,It follows that at some stage in the design process it should be useful to consider how the various functions are most effectively allocated — to man or to machine.,9
423,Fig. 1.2 shows the essentials of the system design process but since feed-back paths are omitted this figure does not indicate either the repetition and iteration which goes on in operational design or the different possible priorities and variability in the order of decision-making.,9
424,The engineering emphasis will be on the search for mechanisms which can most effectively perform the required functions with the human operator in a support role undertaking functions which are not readily mechanised.,9
425,The ergonomics emphasis will be on the human operator as the navigator moving towards the system objectives supported by various mechanisms.,9
426,One neutral viewpoint is to consider formally the relative advantages and limitations of men and machines.,9
427,"These can be listed (Table 1.6) on what is called a ‘Fitts List’ after Paul Fitts who originally proposed this approach (Fitts, 1951).",9
428,"At the time it was hoped that eventually it would be possible to refine the quantitative distinctions between the performance of men and machines allocation of function decisions would be unambiguous (Wuffeck and Zeitlin, 1962), but this has not happened.",9
429,"The reason seems to be that men and machines are fundamentally complementary comparable, this point was originally made by Jordan (1963).",9
430,If a required function can be specified precisely then a mechanism can be designed to perform it.,9
431,The reasons for incorporating men in systems are to do with properties flexibility and adaptability which by their nature are not specifiable in numerical terms.,9
432,Incidentally this clarifies why the man-machine system is such a potent combination.,9
433,Each provides attributes which are not easily available from the other.,9
434,A man without the support of machinery is physically weak and informationally slow.,9
435,A machine without human guidance is inflexible and highly limited in recognition and learning facilities.,9
436,Nevertheless it is not common practice to consider the man-machine allocation of function as an isolated design decision.,9
437,"More usually the allocation emerges from a pattern of related decisions including what can be reliably and economically achieved by hardware and software, what the allocated tasks look like as integrated jobs for the human operators, the skills and traditions of the available work-force, the importance of safety and reliability (Table 1.7).",9
438,As potential functional weaknesses emerge during the design appraisal further consideration is given to what functions might be allocated to the man or machine to provide greater mutual support.,9
439,The result of selective competent design along these lines should be a system with optimal man-machine allocation given the technological state of the art and a comprehensive sensitivity to the feasibility of the human tasks.,9
440,A detailed discussion of the historical development of the allocation of function concept is given in Singleton (1974).,9
441,This approach contravenes currently fashionable Human Factors methodology that there should be a formal attempt to carry out man-machine allocation.,9
442,Operational experience of real systems design reinforces doubts about the allocation of function concept as a basis for a unitary systematic procedure.,9
443,The paradigm illustrated in fig. 1.12 has the virtue of simplicity.,9
444,Like many block diagrams this conceals the practical problems.,9
445,from such a simple diagram it is easy to assume that all the thinking is done functions.,9
446,This cannot be sustained because the only way to validate task analysis is to switch from functional concepts to behavioural concepts and the only way to validate hardware concepts is to switch to thinking specific mechanisms.,9
447,"Thus, allocation of function requires a continuous juggling of functional, mechanistic and behavioural approaches.",9
448,"the separate criteria related to men and mechanisms there are others to do with information acquisition, storage and presentation focussing on the interface design which has its own design criteria.",9
449,Note that a real problem usually involves men one man and thus there are extensive man-man communication issues where few of the functions could conceivably be allocated to non-human mechanisms.,9
450,"In a military command and control situation these will typically be sub-system operators, supervisors and customers using the output (p. 243).",9
451,"design attention can be focussed on the interaction within a single man-machine sub-system it emerges that the man may have very different roles in setting-up, operation and maintenance of his particular machine and each role may require separate man-machine allocation considerations.",9
452,A designer is often restricted by various mandatory requirements based on imagined safeguards against accidents.,9
453,"There are also unspecifiable but potent political restrictions, some from within the organisation, some from outside it.",9
454,"the use of nuclear power in either the military or the civil sense is regarded as qualitatively different from non-nuclear power in its safety, control and management requirements.",9
455,Design is never an isolated logical process.,9
456,There is a legacy of experience from earlier designs which inevitably guide and inhibit a new design.,9
457,The shifts  of allocation of function from this point of view are illustrated in Fig. 1.13.,9
458,"Swain and Wohl (1961) argue that the man-machine concept is oversimplified, it should be man-machine procedures allocation and also that prime equipment should be separated from check-out equipment (Fig. 1.",9
459,14),9
460,In equipment involving advanced technology the allocation of the control function is between the on-line operator and the designer.,9
461,The latter builds decisions into the hardware and software based on his knowledge of the limitations of the mechanisms.,9
462,"High technology can also be used to provide the operator with flexibility in the allocation of functions, he can make his own  decision about when to control manually and when to leave it to the mechanisms.",9
463,This is called supervisory control (Fig. 1.,9
464,15),9
465,It emerges from the above discussion that man-machine allocation of function is an oversimplification and it may lead to the neglect of some key features of human performance.,9
466,Only the human operator can cope with the concept of purposes and goals and more particularly with their modification changing circumstances.,9
467,Knowledge of circumstances is communicated partly by information exchange across man-machine interfaces   but also by verbal exchanges between people.,9
468,"These verbal exchanges can be factual but can also be diffuse in the sharing of attitudes, beliefs, urgencies, doubts .",9
469,These features are just as important to efficient performance as are data about plant functions but they cannot be incorporated in a man-machine allocation process.,9
470,Implicit in the attempt to complete a systematic man-machine function allocation is the principle that some trade-off is possible.,9
471,"More attention to the hardware and information presentation will yield improved operator support whereas more attention to operator training will minimise the difficulties of interpreting information presentations and thereby making full use of machines (Singleton, 1967b).",9
472,These alternative procedures are summarised by the expressions ‘fitting the man to the job’ or ‘fitting the job to the man’.,9
473,"The systems approach indicates that the two should be balanced on technical, economic and behavioural criteria (Table 1.8.).",9
474,"To proceed systematically, both require that there should be the greatest possible understanding of what the man is required to do.",9
475,"The design of the man-machine interface must develop from an understanding of how the man is expected to interact with the machine and correspondingly the design of selection, allocation and training schemes depends on knowing what is required of the operator.",9
476,The study of demands on the operator requires task analysis.,9
477,"In this context the term ‘machine’ is used as shorthand for the total hardware and software system or, in other terminology, the plant.",9
478,For information systems the allocation of function and interface design issues merge into the procedure for considering the required points of human intervention in the total information network.,9
479,From this point of view the allocation of function and interface design are one core design activity based on the man-machine concept.,9
480,Task analysis,9
481,Terminology,9
482,"In the context of systems design, task analysis has become the generic term applicable to the field study of human performance.",9
483,"This is somewhat confusing because the centre of interest may be jobs or skills tasks, and strictly the procedure is often more accurately described as one of synthesis analysis.",9
484,", a designer may build up a sequence of actions which an operator must follow to cause his product to function properly — he has synthesised the task from a knowledge of how the machine or other product was designed to function.",9
485,"Nevertheless, such activity comes under the heading of task analysis (Fig. 1.16).",9
486,"Tasks represent the human contribution to system performance but for   purposes of personnel selection, training and allocation, it is necessary for tasks to be separated or combined into jobs.",9
487,"For systems which have evolved on the basis of operational experience those which have been created by a formal design process, job analysis task analysis may be the starting point of human factors studies.",9
488,The ergonomist will begin his investigation by the consideration of what the personnel actually do in their jobs which have emerged and been refined by practice and personal preference design.,9
489,A is usually considered to be an integrated sub-activity with a particular  purpose as distinct from a which is a particular kind of work carried out by an individual in a system context.,9
490,Jobs are collections of tasks or parts of tasks.,9
491,is the wider term which covers a range of jobs and the career of an individual in a community context.,9
492,", management is an occupation, a production manager is a job, and work scheduling is a task.",9
493,These distinctions are demonstrated in Fig. 1.,9
494,17.,9
495,Another source of ambiguity is that task analysis is often used as a generic term covering any study and description relating to people at work.,9
496,Sometimes this is no more than a description of what has to be done but sometimes it incorporates how the operator does it or should do it.,9
497,"Strictly, this latter should be called a a task description.",9
498,"In principle a task description is not necessarily an activity of   a person, the task might possibly be completed automatically.",9
499,There is no such ambiguity about a which is always person-orientated and not just system-orientated.,9
500,This confusion of terms obscures even further the difficult technical problems of moving from a task description to a skill description.,9
501,The task description should emerge logically from the system design and more particularly from the allocation of functions.,9
502,There is no such deductive way of getting at the skill description.,9
503,This can only be done by studying operators.,9
504,"There are two problems in analysing tasks: one is to acquire the evidence on which to base the task description, the other is to record what has been found out in a way other people, notably the interface designers and the personnel specialists, can use it effectively to assist in their work.",9
505,It aids clarity   to reserve the term to mean the acquisition of evidence and to mean the presentation of the evidence.,9
506,The test of a task description is: does it indicate a necessary function within the system performance?,9
507,"The test of a skill description is: does it indicate how an individual goes about a task, does it allow for individual differences those between a highly skilled operator and a mediocre one?",9
508,For routine low-level tasks there may be no great distinction between a task description and skill description but for high-level tasks there will be a considerable difference.,9
509,Skills analysis is an attempt to get at what is going on in the operator's mind.,9
510,For a repetitive task there may be comparatively little going on in the mind which emerges at the level of consciousness.,9
511,", the assembly of a set of components will be carried out by an experienced operator without thinking about it.",9
512,He may be surprised when the analyst reveals the complexities of his hand movements and finger manipulations.,9
513,"The only way he can recall what he does is by doing it, literally ‘going through the motions’.",9
514,"On the other hand, for a task fault diagnosis he will be thinking about it in various structured ways which he can reveal by talking about it and exploring verbally why he looks at particular indications or takes particular actions.",9
515,Human tasks and the purposes of task analysis are too varied for there to be one standard procedure for either analysis or description.,9
516,Analysing a task where the main requirement is speed of response is different from analysing a task in which problem solving is required.,9
517,A task analysis in the context of ‘fitting the man to the job’ can be very different from one designed to assist in ‘fitting the job to the man’.,9
518,As mentioned above the two extremes of human tasks are the procedure and the diagnosis.,9
519,is usually initiated on the basis of technology and logic by the designer.,9
520,A task has been allocated to the human operator and what he must do is a function of the needs of the hardware.,9
521,Such tasks may be in operation or maintenance.,9
522,In either case the designer writes down the sequence of actions which must be taken coupled with informational indications of what should be happening.,9
523,", in starting up a machine or system (Table 1.9).",9
524,Effectively the operating instructions are the task description.,9
525,"It is, , desirable to check that nothing has been forgotten and to this end it is usual to ask an operator to go through the designed procedure while observing what he does and also observing that the system performs as expected.",9
526,"This may be done on the machine if it is available, or on a simulator or on some kind of mock-up of what the system will be like.",9
527,This is known as the or method of task analysis.,9
528,The difference is only in the kind of task and size of hardware.,9
529,", in the case of starting up a machine at a control panel the operator will be given the instructions and   asked to provide a verbal commentary as he actuates the various controls and checks the various indications, this is a ‘talk through’.",9
530,"On the other hand, a maintenance check of a series of related machines may involve moving between them while activating this and that, this is a ‘walk through’.",9
531,"The operating instructions/task description can be modified if the analysis reveals any problems from the operator's point of view; anything which the designer may have omitted or any difficulties the operator has in moving around, manipulating controls or checking information presentations.",9
532,"Ultimately, the machine layout or interface design may be modified to make the operating instructions easier to follow.",9
533,For complex processes the procedures can include stages of diagnosis (see below) because the operator has to monitor and interpret what is happening in the plant.,9
534,"he is aware of various conditional constraints which form a multidimensional envelope, and whatever happens he must keep the plant state within this envelope.",9
535,"Thus he must have extensive knowledge of the parameters and their relationship, e.g. pressure/temperature curves, together with the safety limits of each parameter.",9
536,"Sometimes the safety limits are fixed, sometimes they are conditional on the state of other variables or plant, sometimes they are merely probabilistic.",9
537,"This is an extremely difficult task, and   the operator requires various aids alarm systems and automatic cut-out devices which are also effectively monitoring the parameters approaching limits (see alarm systems p. 225).",9
538,is even more complex and may indeed be virtually impossible to complete.,9
539,It depends on the complexity of the task faced by the operator.,9
540,The range of diagnostic task difficulties for a control centre is shown in Table 1.10.,9
541,"The operator is assumed to be reacting to a situation in a  control room, containing a great variety of dials, charts, and computer driven displays together with the controls needed to take action in any part of the system.",9
542,"The simplest thing that can go wrong is the failure of one mechanism a pump, valve or thermostat.",9
543,This will be indicated in the control room by changes in pressures and temperatures which the skilled operator will trace readily to the particular failure.,9
544,Usually there will be some redundancy in the system other mechanisms can take over.,9
545,If the hiatus is serious he may have to shut down all or part of the system or it may trip automatically and the operator's task is to observe/control the shut-down to a quiescent state.,9
546,"The worst possible condition that can be envisaged is one in which there is an expert in the plant aiming to do the maximum possible damage and aware of the indications of his actions which are transmitted to the operator — this is not quite science-fiction, it could happen as a form of sabotage,.",9
547,A much less demanding condition is one in which the saboteur is attempting to damage a plant about which he has little or no technical knowledge.,9
548,"However, the difficult condition which requires the most consideration because it is not that unlikely is one in which the operator is faced with a situation where various things have gone wrong naturally or by inadvertent human interference in the plant or instrumentation.",9
549,His diagnostic task is somehow to differentiate between the information he is receiving which is false and that which is valid and follow this by the selection of a remedial strategy.,9
550,"There are further complications in that, the plant failures, not all the standard range of remedial actions will be available.",9
551,"Some automatic reactions may be taking place which might help or hinder, and he must also stay within the mandatory operating instructions.",9
552,"Unfortunately, because such situations are created by combinations of events the number of possibilities is very large and it would be prohibitively tedious to enumerate all of them.",9
553,A complete task description is impossible and the appropriate preparation for the operator is not in direct training but rather in education/understanding of the system and the way it operates.,9
554,He must attempt his diagnosis by returning to the relevant scientific and technological principles.,9
555,How he does this in general terms is illustrated in Fig. 1.,9
556,18.,9
557,The task analysis will take the form of a consideration of the most likely or most dangerous failure and combinations of failures and the ways in which these will appear as indications in the control room.,9
558,This should occur not only at the design stage but also as experience develops in operating the plant and data on actual failures and failure rates become available.,9
559,Such task analysis can only be carried out to some cost-effective limit beyond which the skilled operator must be trusted to get things right by applying his broad expertise.,9
560,"This is not as much of a gamble as it may appear at first sight, there are general principles of how to cope with the system, some  of which can be built into automatic safeguards and some of which can be conveyed to the operator as knowledge and instructions.",9
561,In serious cases the aim is to shut down the system safely.,9
562,"In less serious cases the operator may for a while maintain certain parameters at appropriate levels without diverting his attention to detailed diagnosis, this is called .",9
563,"In dealing with lower technology or less formal system design, there is a range of relatively standard ways of finding out about operator performance   by studying it directly.",9
564,"Task analysis, every other perceptual process, is a matter of setting up mechanisms for categorisation and filtering.",9
565,"The analyst is faced with an activity which is continuous, homogeneous and full of detail, some of which is significant and relevant and some of which is of no consequence.",9
566,", the worker may pause at one point and scratch his nose, this may indicate that a critical decision is being made or it may indicate simply that his nose was itching.",9
567,"The art of task analysis always is to select what does matter, reject what does not matter and separate into categories or stages something which seems at first sight to have no internal boundaries.",9
568,As already mentioned what is significant for a task description leading to an interface design may be different from what is significant for personnel allocation and training but the available procedures are the same.,9
569,"The acquisition of evidence and the presentation of evidence are linked, , it may be necessary to decide what should be presented before it is acquired although more usually it is a matter of presenting what can be acquired.",9
570,The range of human tasks has already been indicated by the description of the extremes of procedural and diagnostic task analysis.,9
571,"The simplest kind of human task, and the most straightforward to observe and analyse, is that in which the operator goes through a standard sequence of actions.",9
572,These are still common in industrial assembly and inspection tasks.,9
573,"The most complex and most difficult to analyse are tasks requiring original thinking often with many apparently random alternations between deduction and induction, this occurs in fault diagnosis tasks.",9
574,"There are two dimensions of complexity: the kind of task and whether the analysis focuses on material, information or people.",9
575,These are illustrated in Table 1.,9
576,11.,9
577,Each cell in this table represents an enormous variety of human work but this is hardly surprising since the total of eighteen cells covers all human work.,9
578,There is a variety of task analysis methods available and the selection of an appropriate set varies with the kind of work (as represented by these cells) and also with the purposes of the analysis.,9
579,Table 1.12 gives examples of kinds of task and the probably appropriate method of task analysis for each cell in Table 1.11.,9
580,It should be emphasised that this is only a tentative illustration.,9
581,"The method used for a particular analysis depends on a great variety of factors including the analyst's expertise, the time available, the situations accessible for study, the related information already available, the purpose of the analysis .",9
582,Task analysis by observation,9
583,.,9
584,Accurate observation of what a person is doing is not easy.,9
585,The observer needs some discipline which ensures that he really does   focus on the detail and separates the action into a coherent sequence.,9
586,The required discipline is provided by the attempt to complete a chart a flow process chart using the A.S.M.E. symbols.,9
587,These were originally standardised by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.,9
588,The symbols and an illustration of a flow process chart are shown in Fig. 1.19.,9
589,"It is assumed that whatever an operator is doing can be classified into one of five categories: operation, inspection, transport, delay and storage.",9
590,Delay occurs when the operator is doing nothing — usually waiting for a machine to complete a sub-task — it differs from storage where there has been a particular decision to put something aside.,9
591,", storage for a hand implies some static work — the operator is holding something or exerting a force of some kind although there is no resulting movement.",9
592,"Process charts may concentrate on material, operator actions or the events in the process.",9
593,"These are known respectively as material-type, man-type or process-type charts.",9
594,More details of these charts and how to complete them are given in ILO (1979).,9
595,The same symbols are used for a two-handed process chart in which a detailed description of what each hand is doing separately is provided (Fig.  1.20).,9
596,The meaning of the symbols changes somewhat because the separation of events is much more detailed.,9
597,"The same symbols can also be made to follow the concurrent behaviour of members of a team (Chapanis, 1959).",9
598,"Note that, the inspection category, the emphasis is entirely on what the operator does.",9
599,"Little attention is paid to the input side as distinct from the output side, the sensory information and feed-back which the operator is using to control what he is doing is neglected.",9
600,"This is appropriate enough for highly repetitive routine tasks because, as mentioned earlier, the operator is probably proceeding with little conscious attention and the limitation on performance is in the speed of the action in the informational control.",9
601,To broaden the emphasis on a two-handed process chart it is possible to add   another column labelled ‘attention’ or ‘sensory activity’and to try to describe human activity in these areas at particular points in the sequence.,9
602,This goes beyond direct observations and requires some inference or speculation the observer.,9
603,"Finer analysis of hand movements is possible using classifications Therbligs (Shaw, 1952), or Methods-Time-Measurement symbols (Maynard .,",9
604,1956).,9
605,Analysis at this level of detail is not usually attempted by direct observation but rather by film or video analysis.,9
606,.,9
607,"These are similar to flow process charts no standard symbols are used, the chart is simply a list of the actions the operator takes but there may well be additional columns referring to the events which occur and the consequent information which appears.",9
608,A sequence chart is more appropriate for a routine interaction with a machine a physical manipulation of objects.,9
609,An example is given in Table 1.,9
610,1 3.,9
611,Sequence charts are particularly useful for the study and description of starting up and shutting down procedures.,9
612,They form the basis for procedural training.,9
613,.,9
614,"This is a detailed sequence chart orientated more towards operator choice of actions and correspondingly relevant to the study of interface design training (Singleton, 1964).",9
615,"It is assumed that for every action the operator has a purpose, the choice of the particular action at the particular time or point in the sequence is triggered by some other event, usually the successful completion of an action is indicated by a particular information presentation which also is noted on the chart.",9
616,The chart is particularly useful for detecting when information about action completion is not available and when an action is required which is not triggered by information from the situation.,9
617,", the operator has to depend on his memory (which is unreliable).",9
618,An example is given in Table 1.,9
619,14.,9
620,.,9
621,These are more graphical presentations as distinct from verbal listings.,9
622,They are used to indicate the spatial location and separation of events which are integral parts of the same process.,9
623,An illustration of a flow chart is given in Fig. 1.21.,9
624,It is possible to obtain a kind of flow chart automatically by using successive photographs of operator positions on the same photographic plate.,9
625,"More usually, this is done by attaching lights to the wrists or to other parts of the body, if the light is flashing at a known frequency the relative time of particular positions the sequence can be measured.",9
626,This is called a .,9
627,Flow charts are a useful record of a process but are not  particularly suited as a basis for analysis which might lead to improved job design or training.,9
628,"On the other hand, they can clearly indicate differences in ways of doing something.",9
629,.,9
630,These are particularly useful to describe situations where events occur in parallel or in patterns in a single series.,9
631,"The block diagram is highly versatile as a spatial representation of any process at any level, that is the same process can be represented by one block or by very many blocks which provide more detail.",9
632,The art of useful block diagram production is to select the appropriate level of detail.,9
633,Most people find such diagrams much easier to understand than paragraphs of explanatory prose but the flexibility itself can lead to the difficulties illustrated in Fig. 1.22.,9
634,It is important that blocks are at about the same level of complexity within one diagram.,9
635,"Blocks may represent physical entities, topics, concepts, decisions, actions or processes.",9
636,If these are mixed in the same diagram the distinctions between categories should be indicated by using differently shaped blocks.,9
637,Many of the figures in this chapter illustrate this convention.,9
638,Homogeneity is also desirable in the meaning of lines and arrows.,9
639,A line may indicate a causal link but simple cause-effect relationships are destroyed if there are feed-back lines.,9
640,"Usually the line represents the flow of something but that something might be material, energy, information or time but again these should not be mixed on the same diagram unless differently coded lines are used.",9
641,It is usually possible to invert a diagram so that blocks and lines are interchanged.,9
642,One of the more subtle failures is to confuse a block diagram with its inverse.,9
643,An inverted block diagram can be a path-node diagram.,9
644,The advantage of these is that the length of the path can be used to indicate time taken.,9
645,This is the basis of ‘critical-path analysis’ where such a network can be analysed.,9
646,The shortest path through a network is the minimum time in which the whole process represented could be completed.,9
647,The longest sequence of required activities is the time it will take if no adjustments are made.,9
648,An optimum path can be selected and other activities adjusted to phase in with those on this ‘critical path’.,9
649,"There are formal techniques of network analysis which occasionally prove useful; , in identifying equivalent diagrams or ways of simplifying diagrams (Battersby, 1970).",9
650,.,9
651,These are a particular form of block diagram where the emphasis is on binary choices.,9
652,Again there can be concentration on events or on operator decisions.,9
653,In the latter case these are usually an oversimplification because there is an underlying assumption that decisions are being made in a simple logical sequence.,9
654,"In practice, the operator jumps forwards and backwards within the pattern indicated on the chart rechecking some decisions and anticipating others.",9
655,"Nevertheless, by relating required information to decision points any lack of information can be revealed.",9
656,"It invariably turns out that an operator makes a series of decisions partly on the basis of what is currently displayed () and partly on the basis of other material obtained from his knowledge of the system performance, his briefing and his operating instructions ().",9
657,Adequate on-line and off-line information is essential for apposite decision-making.,9
658,Fig. 1.23 shows such a chart.,9
659,.,9
660,Function Analysis System Technique was developed by Bytheway (1977) within value engineering.,9
661,It imposes useful discipline on the production of a functional diagram in two ways.,9
662,Within each block the function should be described by a verb and a noun.,9
663,The functions are arranged in a sequence an arrow to the right on any line indicates HOW? and an arrow to the left indicates WHY?,9
664,If these criteria cannot be met then either the functions are in the wrong order or some are missing.,9
665,"The diagram should be produced by writing each function on a card, the cards are then arranged to meet the criteria.",9
666,Unfortunately the resulting diagram is not so easy to interpret as are some of the other forms of chart.,9
667,there is no obvious starting or ending point and the lines do not indicate a sequence.,9
668,Fig. 1.24 shows an example.,9
669,.,9
670,"As a Task Description, a block diagram is intended to illustrate the dynamic behaviour of the system with emphasis on human interactions within the system.",9
671,For some purposes it is appropriate to use blocks and lines to indicate the flow of energy or material and to indicate all the ways in which the human operator can affect this flow.,9
672,This is not a performance diagram but a potential performance diagram (Fig. 1.25).,9
673,For other purposes it is appropriate to concentrate on a specific sequential task and illustrate the order of events involving human actions (e.g. Figs. 1.,9
674,19 and 1.20).,9
675,If a particular dimension (usually left to right or down) indicates a time scale sequence this is called a .,9
676,The blocks may even be omitted to further emphasise the relative timing of events.,9
677,(Fig. 1.26).,9
678,Alternatively if the process is highly complex the emphasis may be on the pattern of events as indicated by a network of blocks with a specialist symbol indicating the many points within the system for which information for the operator might appear and another symbol for points where he can interfere in the system dynamics (Fig. 1.27).,9
679,Task analysis by discussion,9
680,"Observation of operator performance within many high technology systems reveals nothing more than a person sitting at a desk scanning various kinds of displays at intervals and just occasionally picking up a telephone, making a note in a log-book or manipulating a control.",9
681,"In such situations, the task analysis requires extensive discussion observation.",9
682,"Such discussions will centre on the operators themselves but may also involve others the management, the training officers, the safety specialists and the  system designers.",9
683,There will often be complications there can be two or more operators working simultaneously with overlapping tasks.,9
684,The supervisor may also monitor the same information or may have his own separate displays or both.,9
685,In such a team operation there will normally be a clear standard mandatory difference of responsibility but in practice what they actually do can overlap and overlap differently for different teams.,9
686,"Inevitably, discussion with different individuals about a particular task will yield very   different versions of what is being done or should be done.",9
687,If there is a written version of what ought to be being done this is a useful basic document.,9
688,However the supervisor will point out that things have changed since that was produced and he will have his own view of the essentials of the task.,9
689,The operators themselves will again have a different version.,9
690,The differences will be   mainly in emphasis on what is important central activity and what is peripheral.,9
691,"Even between operators carrying out what is ostensibly the same task there will be discrepancies, particularly if the discussion extends from what is required to the way these requirements are met.",9
692,"Similarly the specialists, the training officers, task designers and safety officers will have their own version structured the particular difficulties they have had in their specific contributions to the task performance.",9
693,"Finally, task descriptions differ with the personal biases of analysts and the reasons why they are conducting the analysis.",9
694,"However, all these sources of ambiguity the comprehensive task description is the essential starting point for most human factors work.",9
695,An approach structured by a particular procedure is of considerable assistance in reducing ambiguity and ensuring that the result is comprehensive.,9
696,The approach might consist of any one or any combination of the following techniques.,9
697,.,9
698,A useful starting point for the study of any system is a responsibility chart.,9
699,This can indicate not only the hierarchy but also the different levels of modelling the system.,9
700,"Normally, the operators closest to the plant will have the most detailed information and this gets condensed or reduced as one moves up the hierarchy.",9
701,"in a power station the desk operator will monitor the detail of the plant performance, the supervisor will have more summarised information and greater contact with the national grid, while the station manager's on-line information about the plant is presented on one or at the most two dials in his office which indicate station output.",9
702,A responsibility chart can indicate not only decisions and duties but also the information needed to discharge these duties (Table 1.,9
703,1 5).,9
704,Although it is usual to model responsibilities a hierarchical tree there are bound to be overlaps between what appear to be different levels of the hierarchy.,9
705,These shared or duplicated responsibilities are unavoidable and often in fact are desirable because the process is one of mutual monitoring which usually improves reliability.,9
706,"Occasionally overlap may have the opposite effect the ‘falling between two stools’ phenomenon, two operators at the same level or at different levels may each assume that the other has taken a particular action which they both know is required.",9
707,The remedy is adequate information feed-back and continuous checking but the need for this may not    be obvious from the chart because the areas of overlap are difficult to illustrate.,9
708,It makes for much neater charting to assume that there are no overlaps but this defeats one of the main purposes of the chart.,9
709,"Hence the most comprehensive and useful charts often have many irregular comments, asterisks, footnotes, directing arrows , which at first sight detract from the clarity of the presentation.",9
710,.,9
711,"Tasks, responsibilities, are susceptible to subdivision at different levels.",9
712,A useful way of describing a complex task is to separate it into sub-tasks and further separate these sub-tasks into even smaller units.,9
713,This provides a very clear picture of the total activity although the order of doing things may not be obvious.,9
714,Such an hierarchical table (Fig. 1.28) can be supplemented by lists or sequences of operations which define a plan or a subroutine within a total task.,9
715,"Correspondingly, a tree or network of operations can define a pattern of decision-making.",9
716,"This technique, originally developed by Annett (1971), has been used extensively as a basis for training and retraining requirements (Duncan, 1975, Shepherd and Duncan, 1980), and also for the study of job satisfaction (Crawley and Spurgeon, 1979).",9
717,"For a particular system there may be many different but equally valid ways of separating tasks into sub-tasks the relative emphasis on  training, interface design and other system design aspects.",9
718,Sometimes a ‘bottom-up’ approach may be better than a ‘top-down’one.,9
719,.,9
720,An operator carrying out a task can be asked to talk about what he is doing as he does it.,9
721,Clearly this is useful for tasks which involve extensive scanning of information sources and deliberations about what action to take.,9
722,The visible action may apparently be trivial — adjusting one or two of very many available controls — or may even be non-existent.,9
723,"This sort of task is very common in process control situations where the operator often makes a preliminary three-way decision corresponding to the worldwide system of red, amber and green traffic lights.",9
724,", he does nothing, he does nothing at the moment but prepares for action, or he takes action.",9
725,"Because so much of the activity is in searching for information and processing it leading to a decision, the observed output is obviously a poor indicator of total activity and his verbal commentary is a much better guide to his task performance.",9
726,Such a commentary can be recorded or notes can be taken directly by the analyst.,9
727,The snag about recording is that an enormous amount of material is produced which is very tedious to analyse.,9
728,"The presentation of the result may use any of the charting methods described in this chapter, or may take the form of a descriptive narrative.",9
729,.,9
730,Man-Computer Interaction has further complicated the relationship between human operators and other parts of a system but the computer can help to analyse these interactions.,9
731,Tainsh (1985) has developed a technique in which a computer-based simulation of a generic information handling task is used to assist in analysing the behaviour of an operator or a team of operators.,9
732,"There are two V.D.U.s, one displaying alphanumeric data, the other graphical data.",9
733,"A group of operators (note, these are people with extensive experience of the same or similar tasks, not the unskilled  performer normally used in human performance experiments) run through a task using this equipment.",9
734,Their behaviour and achievements are observed and discussed amongst themselves and with the analyst (Fig. 1.29).,9
735,Conclusion,9
736,Task analysis has not and cannot be reduced to a set of standardised procedures which the aspiring analyst could acquire in a formal training course.,9
737,The techniques just described are no more than guidelines in what remains the creative art of studying and describing what an experienced worker is doing or will be required to do.,9
738,The danger in being too rigid is that justice will not be done to the flexibility and complexity of human performance.,9
739,"The danger of being too flexible is that the ergonomists will have an inadequate basis from which to design interfaces, training courses and other operator aids.",9
740,If a comprehensive task description can be completed then it is legitimate to enquire why the task cannot be allocated to a technical device a human being.,9
741,Yet without a reasonably comprehensive task description the total system performance may be unreliable or unpredictable.,9
742,There is a necessary compromise which can only be arrived at in the context of a particular system.,9
743,As mentioned earlier there are always the twin problems of how to get the information and how to present it.,9
744,"It is sometimes easier to proceed on the basis of: ‘If I were doing the job this is how I would do it’, but this can be delusory even for analysts who have past experience as operators.",9
745,"For analysts who are designers creating a new task there may be no alternative, but any task description arrived at by this method should be checked against the behaviour of real operators as they gain experience.",9
746,A particular difficulty about task synthesis is that there is no easy way of confirming completeness.,9
747,"A task description which is part of a design process should be fully — documented the origins of information, the assumptions made and the methods used.",9
748,The standard method of producing task descriptions is to write all the separate sub-tasks at various levels on cards and then assemble the cards in a network.,9
749,"There is a temptation to make these final diagrams very large, but often it is more useful to separate into small units with cross-referencing.",9
750,"The optimum size seems to be A3, this is easily copied and circulated but is large enough to contain considerable detail.",9
751,"The procedure can be computerised, there are programmes available for the easy production, manipulation and storage of block diagrams with useful cross-referencing facilities.",9
752,There is an inherent difficulty in that often the main dividend from a task  analysis is from the act of obtaining it.,9
753,Those not involved find it difficult to gain very much from a presentation of a task description.,9
754,"Like reference books, they have to be used read.",9
755,"Task analysis can be very expensive in skilled manpower, but in looking at cost/value it is important to include in value the increase in mutual understanding which occurs when a multi-disciplinary team conducts the analysis.",9
756,If such a team is used the required man-hours can be optimised by using the Delphi method a long series of group meetings.,9
757,"Political, economic and social issues which arise in conducting Task Analyses are discussed in the context of Job Analysis (p. 148).",9
758,Application,9
759,Man-power planning,9
760,The ‘Human Resource’ concept of man-power as the central profit-generating asset of any organisation has made some progress over the past twenty years.,9
761,"There was particular interest around 1970 when companies were prosperous, stable and innovative (IPM, 1972, Patten, 1971).",9
762,"The objective is to revise and almost reverse the traditional accountancy concept of man-power as a resource consuming factor requiring regular payments, overheads in the form of heated, lighted, equipped workspaces .",9
763,"From the narrow accountancy viewpoint, people are a cost and it is desirable to keep this cost as low as possible.",9
764,"In these terms it is very difficult to justify, , sending a member of staff on a training course.",9
765,The training requires expenditure and so also does the replacement for the person away.,9
766,Where is the return?,9
767,The return is actually in the improved human resource but this is not readily measurable in terms which accountants use.,9
768,"There have been two attempts to reduce human resources to this form of measurement (Giles and Robinson, 1972).",9
769,One is to acquire a human asset multiplier for each level of staff.,9
770,The multiplier for manual staff might be unity but it increases with staff level and becomes three or more for management.,9
771,The other is to add together all the personnel costs for each kind of worker from the original job advertisement through to the retirement or redundancy payments.,9
772,"The first does attempt to obtain a value, the second remains essentially a cost and not a value.",9
773,It would be unduly optimistic to assume that management skills have risen to a level costs undertaken can be assumed to be equivalent to value.,9
774,A less direct measure which is applicable only to the most senior management is to observe the fall or rise of the share price when a particular executive leaves or joins a company.,9
775,"This can be very high, for a large company a change in market value of millions of pounds is not unusual.",9
776,The most serious consequence of the accountancy view of man-power is that high level policy decision-making does not give this factor sufficient weight.,9
777,", the main board of a company will have complete details of cost and values of physical resources buildings and equipment but relatively scanty data about the man-power which is their most important asset.",9
778,Indeed it will be described almost entirely as a liability because the costs will be known.,9
779,"Similarly, broad factors the state of morale will again only be described by negative features absenteeism, stoppages, strikes, low quality output .",9
780,"It is obvious that company output and projects must reflect the man-power and its performance level, but, if this is acknowledged , it is only in brief verbal terms within, , the chairman's annual report.",9
781,"The obsession, of current management, with measurement and the reduction of every variable to numbers for ease of computer manipulation has worsened the situation.",9
782,Unfortunately there is no easy remedy.,9
783,Human resources are too complex a variable to be easily susceptible to measurement beyond the level of counting heads and trades.,9
784,Key variables the quality of staff at any level and the current morale are only expressible verbal descriptive terms.,9
785,"It is generally accepted (p. 145) that ‘hygiene’ type variables pay and working conditions can, if they are inappropriately specified, depress morale and motivation but they will not in themselves result in very high levels of these parameters.",9
786,Morale and motivation are influenced more by conditions of work in the sense of work variety opportunities and attitudes of management.,9
787,These factors are worthy of emphasis because in practice they are still dealt with very badly in many organisations and yet it takes little trouble or expertise to make an enormous difference.,9
788,", very few senior managements take the trouble to keep workers fully informed about policies and likely changes.",9
789,The result is excessive reliance on rumour and continuous speculation which is not only time-consuming but is also highly deleterious in morale terms.,9
790,The two human factors which can be unambiguously measured are age and sex.,9
791,The age distribution of a work force is always an interesting and important source of information.,9
792,For most purposes a rectangular distribution is the most desirable because it provides the appropriate mix of youthful enthusiasm and ageing experience.,9
793,It also makes for regular changes as staff retire and are replaced.,9
794,"Many distributions show a peak in a particular age group mainly associated with taking on a large number of young people when the organisation was started or reorganised, this is not desirable because it leads to excessive competition for promotion at particular stages.",9
795,"These comments are obviously most relevant for work forces where there is little tendency to move  out, this is characteristic of a surprisingly large number of organisations in European countries and in Japan but much less so in the U.S.A.",9
796,Stable work forces have their advantages familiarity with the enterprise and its peculiar needs but they do result in problems if the market for the products is erratic or otherwise unpredictable.,9
797,"This is particularly so in high technology e.g. design and construction of ships, aircraft, power stations and chemical plant, where the product unit is large and expensive and the variety of required expertise is extensive.",9
798,"Some peaks of demand can be dealt with by using consultants, but they tend to be expensive and do not always fit well with ill-defined but important factors the favoured style of the organisation.",9
799,In well ordered systems it may be possible to calculate the length of in-house experience required to achieve the required level of expertise in particular topics and compare this with the lead time for particular product requirements.,9
800,Given time available to train new staff it is not necessary to keep more than a nucleus in that particular expertise.,9
801,"On the other hand, if there is usually insufficient notice of need it may be necessary to keep staff who have periods with little to do between projects.",9
802,It is also desirable to have the possibility of shifting staff between design and operational duties.,9
803,"This not only provides flexibility in the use of man-power, it also improves communication.",9
804,These real difficulties of man-power utilisation are to force many organisations to become larger and larger if they are to remain economic.,9
805,Size provides a cushion to the vicissitudes of markets but it creates other problems.,9
806,", difficulties of communications and , how to inculcate the feeling within each individual that he and his performance are important to the organisation.",9
807,This is considered in more detail in Chapter 3.,9
808,"Human resources should be fundamental to subjects ergonomics which are essentially people-centred but the concept remains procedurally undeveloped at any level from a continent through countries, regions and companies down to particular working systems.",9
809,This is one reason why policy makers never seem to take account fully of the people affected by their decisions.,9
810,The design of procedures,9
811,The increased importance of standardised informational support for both machines and operators has led to the concept of procedures as a separate design issue within a system (Fig. 1.30).,9
812,Much of this information can be incorporated in computer programs but there is also a need for extensive printed paper for the use of the operator.,9
813,"This takes three main forms: checklists, routines and knowledge-texts.",9
814,The terminology in this field is not standardised.,9
815,"Software might be  restricted, as in this book, to computer programs but it is sometimes used as the generic term to include all sources of information.",9
816,Procedures is sometimes used for what are here called routines and sometimes to indicate all the operator's information support except software.,9
817,The situation is further confused when some but not all the operator information support is itself computer-based.,9
818,Sometimes the term firm-ware is used.,9
819,However whatever the terminology used there is a requirement for design effort.,9
820,The quality of procedures would be much improved if designers followed some simple guide-lines (Table 1.16).,9
821,Many documents are written on the implicit assumption that the reader is much like the writer expertise    and style of thinking.,9
822,Similarly it is assumed that the conditions under which the reading will take place are the same as those of writing which are usually a clean well-lit office.,9
823,"They may have to be read in the open air, in rain and darkness or within a plant under oily, cramped, poorly lit conditions.",9
824,The user probably has limited expertise and he may be working under various stress conditions.,9
825,"The material on which the information is printed, the typeface used, the sequence, the structure and the format generally should reflect the conditions of use,(Easterby and Zwaga, 1984).",9
826,All these things can be achieved if it is acknowledged that all procedures should a validated by users under the normal conditions of use.,9
827,Checklists,9
828,"Checklists are used in the pre-start mode, for routine maintenance and for fault-finding.",9
829,They normally take the form of a series of questions or statements which the operator uses to guide and structure his inspection of the hardware and other system components.,9
830,"The sequence is dictated by the optimal order in which actions should be taken, in starting up an aircraft.",9
831,"There are many situations when the order is of no great consequence, a safety audit of a new machine, and in this latter case some logical structure is needed.",9
832,"As mentioned  above, the logic of the design may not be the optimal basis if the way the operator thinks and acts is different.",9
833,Baker (1984) suggests that four kinds of shortcoming emerge when checklists are validated in the real situation.,9
834,The operator may deviate from the listed procedure because it may require excessive moving about or because he is interrupted by the requirements of other tasks.,9
835,"Systematic use of a checklist often reveals faults in work design inadequate access, visibility and labelling.",9
836,"The checklist itself may be inconsistent, incomplete, imprecise or ambiguous.",9
837,"Finally the checklist may have reprographic limitations inadequate vertical or horizontal structure, poor typefaces and insufficient linking of requirements, descriptions, remarks and tick-off points.",9
838,The International Ergonomics Association developed a general ergonomics checklist which is reproduced in Edholm (1967).,9
839,There is a deceptive simplicity about such lists which requires extensive effort to ensure a comprehensive but coherent content.,9
840,"The context is, , the context of ergonomics as conceived by the designers of the list.",9
841,Routines,9
842,A routine is the most common form of instructional material.,9
843,"The reader is required to follow a series of steps which might, , introduce a change in the performance of a complex system.",9
844,Normally routines are single chains of instructions although it is possible to have some conditional branching.,9
845,"Each step should be simple and complete in itself — preferably with some indication that successful completion has been achieved, the appearance or the change of colour of a signal light, or the noise of a motor starting or a change of pressure which indicates that there has been a change in the flow of some material.",9
846,As mentioned earlier a routine can often be regarded as a written task description.,9
847,By definition and design intention routines are inflexible.,9
848,The user is intended to behave exactly their instruction.,9
849,"No great skill or intellectual effort is required, which is one way of saying that the human operator is being under-used, but the purpose of a routine is usually to avoid common human error omitting a step or reversing steps.",9
850,"the value of formal routines is precisely that the operator, left to himself, will not normally function in such a systematic sequential manner.",9
851,Knowledge texts,9
852,Knowledge is contained in documents which may vary from single sheet presentations to large manuals.,9
853,"As instructional material it is indirect  the reader is not necessarily told what to do, as in a routine.",9
854,Rather he is informed about the situation and the purpose of informing him is to provide a knowledge base from which he can work out his own actions.,9
855,"Nevertheless, the relevant action remains important and the knowledge provided should be carefully and stringently selected.",9
856,It is too easy to follow the academic tradition and provide knowledge for its own sake.,9
857,"The ‘need to know’ criterion is crucial because unless it is applied, the operator can be overburdened with unnecessary material.",9
858,Correspondingly the material should be structured how it is most likely to be used.,9
859,In this context the operator requires a guide for action and not a scientific text-book.,9
860,"It is invariably better to provide material diagrammatically, systematically or in well-structured short paragraphs in flowing prose.",9
861,Consider how readily information about the relative position of streets is available from a map of a town centre a verbal description of all the streets.,9
862,Such a map will enable the reader to work out for himself how to get from one location to another within the town.,9
863,Note the enormous flexibility compared with a routine which would tell him only how to get from one particular point to another.,9
864,"A second important difference is that if he misses his place in a routine he will be totally lost, whereas if he happens to go in the wrong direction while using a map he is still able to make whatever correction is necessary.",9
865,However the map does require more intellectual effort than does the routine not only in making decisions about how to proceed but also in filtering out the required information from the massive irrelevance (for a particular task) which is equally available.,9
866,"Thus, one would expect the use of the maps to be slower than the use of routines with the human performance being more versatile but less predictable.",9
867,With two-dimensional representations maps it remains important to avoid too much homogeneity and provide substructure in the form of main roads and key buildings or other features rivers.,9
868,"See, , Fig. 5.3",9
869,"Manuals which may contain maps, schematic diagrams and other materials warrant separate consideration.",9
870,The design of manuals,9
871,A manual is usually in the form of a book or booklet which is sent with the hardware from the maker to the customer.,9
872,It is part of the communication package from the designer to the user.,9
873,Thus it is a particular form of job aid which provides the operator with information on a system and its performance.,9
874,The standard of manual design has traditionally been very low for several   reasons.,9
875,"For this purpose, the designer is too familiar with the product and he rarely takes the trouble to find out what the user really needs to know.",9
876,"Often the manual has to be provided hurriedly at the end of a project when the budget is running out, and it is regarded as a tiresome chore still required after the essential design work has been completed.",9
877,The problem is particularly acute for computers.,9
878,"Manuals for cars, machine tools are poor but it is possible to observe the mechanisms and their functions.",9
879,"Most computer operators do not know or wish to know about the mechanisms, and in any case these are not accessible to vision and manipulation.",9
880,"The computer operator is entirely dependent on the manual, in the early stages of gaining familiarity with the system and its functions.",9
881,He is usually very badly served although the principles of manual design are well known.,9
882,For most systems the manual is best divided into parts as indicated in Table 1.17.,9
883,"The first part should be a general introduction which orientates the readers towards the system, its purpose, its functional structure and mode of operation and its performance limits.",9
884,This should be followed by a separate section on how to set the system up in the first place and how to check that it is working properly.,9
885,"If it is fairly small it may be necessary to describe how to unpack it, fix it into position, connect it to power supplies and start it up.",9
886,"If it is large, the emphasis will be on the start up procedure.",9
887,The section describing the operation of the system should cover not only how the system operates but also how the user can operate it.,9
888,"Extensive use of line drawings, schematic  diagrams, algorithmic lists is desirable, and where prose is used this also should be structured into short sentences with meaningful separation into paragraphs.",9
889,"The maintenance section should indicate what, if anything, the operator is expected to do and the symptoms which indicate that more specialist maintenance skills are required.",9
890,Tables subdivided into Faults/Reasons/Remedies can be extremely helpful.,9
891,Parts lists including description reference numbers and sometimes drawings are necessary if the user is expected to deal with his own replacements.,9
892,A standard fault is to assume that the reader is familiar with the jargon which the designer habitually uses.,9
893,A glossary of terms and acronyms used can be very helpful not only to the reader but also to the writer who is forced to consider carefully how he is using various technical terms.,9
894,"Finally, all manuals should end with an index which supplements the table of contents at the beginning.",9
895,SKILL AND TRAINING,9
896,Concepts.,9
897,Development aspects,9
898,Most laboratory and field studies of human behaviour involve taking a situational snap-shot at a given time in a given place.,9
899,It is easy to overlook the continuously changing nature both of people and of work situations.,9
900,"When the skilled manager encounters what, on the face of it, is an intolerable set of work practices, attitudes and performance he does not necessarily take drastic action, he identifies the natural processes of change and accelerates them.",9
901,"In a remarkably short time changes in procedures, products and work-load, promotions, resignations, retirements can transform any situation.",9
902,The changes within an individual are even more inexorably continuous.,9
903,Again it is easy to develop the illusion that a worker is a constant factor in a changing situation particularly for a person in the middle period of working life.,9
904,This was encouraged by the traditional view of a skilled man as one who learned his trade by the age of 21 and thereafter practised it for forty years until he retired at 65.,9
905,This was never the case and in the current working world it is even less so because of developing technology which has its impact on almost all jobs and also on the social context of work.,9
906,", employment levels there is currently an emphasis on earlier retirement from and later entry into the working world.",9
907,These trends are particularly marked in manufacturing industry where the work force is falling and the capital investment per worker is rising rapidly.,9
908,For these reasons industry is moving towards a concept of the ideal worker as a physically fit adaptable young person.,9
909,The labour force is becoming more like the military with the use of a limited age range and the screening anyone with any kind of disability who might not be able to work at a pace and with the flexibility and precision which will maintain the return on the very large capital investment.,9
910,", it remains true that the performance of the individual is a function of the way he developed skills in his earlier more formative years and the way in which his capacities and skills are still changing in the work environment.",9
911,"Human development can be described three attributes: capacities, skills and aspirations (Singleton, 198 1).",9
912,"The healthy, well-adapted individual keeps them in balance in a dynamic equilibrium.",9
913,"His natural endowment consists of a particular range of capacities: physical strength, mobility, vision, hearing, intellect .",9
914,"These form the basis for the development of a repertoire of skills dictated partly by capacities and partly by environmental circumstances the particular family, community and region he is born into and the available facilities for play, education and training.",9
915,The balance and integration of capacities and skills is achieved by the third attribute of aspirations.,9
916,These are partly determined by and partly determine the other attributes.,9
917,The individual is in difficulties if his aspirations do not match his capacities and skills but most people are sufficiently realistic and have sufficient self-knowledge to keep these attributes in line.,9
918,"The most flexible attribute is the skills, these can be developed or changed capacities and aspirations.",9
919,"A well-ordered civilisation demands standard basic skills of a physical kind: mobility and manipulation, and also of a mental kind: reading, writing and arithmetic.",9
920,On the basis of these standard skills there is enormous flexibility for the individual to develop his own identity and to express it through his specialised skills.,9
921,"As the individual gets older, he continues to acquire new skills for two reasons.",9
922,"Firstly, the passage of time provides more and more experience and this is inevitably reflected in the skill repertoire.",9
923,"Secondly, the ageing individual suffers a steady diminution of capacities, the decrease in adaptability to lower lighting levels and the decrease in physical stamina.",9
924,Skills develop and change to compensate partially for the changing capacities.,9
925,"It follows, , that decreasing capacities as such are not direct predictors of decreasing performance.",9
926,This is true not only for ageing but also for the onset of disabilities (see Chapter 7).,9
927,Human skill,9
928,Skills are the residues of learning.,9
929,To describe behaviour as skilled is to say no more than that it has been influenced by training and experience.,9
930,There is often an implication that skilled means highly skilled although this connotation confuses the concept of existence and level.,9
931,Unskilled is also used to imply a low level of skill its absence.,9
932,Level of skill is usually assessed extent of formal training although this is only one of the relevant factors: others include length of experience and degree of integration.,9
933,Foundation skills are acquired in the first five years of life.,9
934,These include not only perceptual-motor skills but also the basic language and social skills.,9
935,Thereafter the educational system supplements the interaction with family and friends in providing facilities and exemplars for further symbolic and social   skill development.,9
936,More details of all these skills are contained in Table 2.1.,9
937,The specific skills which a person acquires whilst earning a living are combinations and developments of the standard skills of the normal healthy adult.,9
938,This is not to denigrate the uniqueness and quality of working skills.,9
939,"They are of the underrated because the universal characteristic of high skill is that, to an observer, the performance does not appear to be very difficult.",9
940,"This is because the skilled individual is normally working well within his capacities, he does not have to search desperately for information because he knows exactly what to look for, his movements are not hurried because they are integrated into smooth chains and he does not react suddenly because he anticipates what is going to happen.",9
941,", he works on the principle of minimal effort to achieve the required objectives both speed and quality.",9
942,The importance of skill theory is that it relates human performance to systems concepts and to individual differences.,9
943,The performer is pursuing an objective and the great variety of his activity has meaning his objective.,9
944,Skill is a functional concept aimed at the understanding of how it is done without recourse to the detail of underlying physiological mechanisms.,9
945,Individual differences are obviously a consequence of the particular past experience of each person who has thereby acquired a unique set of skills based on a natural endowment which was also unique.,9
946,"Skill theory also emphasises the closely integrated nature of behaviour in real situations, it is not readily susceptible to analysis into discrete components.",9
947,The internal representation of a skill is called a schema.,9
948,A schema is an  internal model which can be used to relate external events to a current purpose (Head 1920).,9
949,It is modified continuously as external data is received and transformed into information.,9
950,Schemata may be person centred or situation centred.,9
951,"For a more extensive discussion of schemata, how they differ and how they function, see Singleton (1981).",9
952,Acquisition of skills,9
953,"Skills are acquired by a process of trial and error but the trials are not entirely random as is assumed in classical trial and error learning (Thorndike, 191 1).",9
954,"However, the more primitive the skill the more there must be an element of chance.",9
955,", one of the skills developed in the first few years of life involves the integration of data arriving through the different sensory channels.",9
956,The fact that a visually observed impact between two bodies in the physical world is normally associated with a particular sound has to be learned.,9
957,"Hence the importance of play in hitting, say, tins with spoons — the visual, auditory and tactile impressions are being integrated.",9
958,Similarly the kinaesthetic sensation of a limb moving has to be associated with the visual sensation obtained by observing the limb — hence the countless hours which babies spend just watching their own limbs move.,9
959,"This is how manipulative skills begin, but it will be noted that even these are not purely ‘motor’, they are mainly ‘perceptual’.",9
960,Greater precision is achieved by more definitive selection and guidance.,9
961,Unskilled activity is to do everything to do nothing.,9
962,"The concept of motor skill is associated, with the development of longer and more complex patterns of activity which can be reeled off following a single trigger and which are monitored on the basis that only feedback which indicates errors needs attention.",9
963,"Industrial training for manual operations is designed to encourage this kind of development (Seymour, 1966).",9
964,Perceptual skills by contrast are developments to do with the greater selectivity of information needed to monitor situations and guide actions.,9
965,"These begin from an appreciation of the complementary nature of data arriving through the different sensory channels and expand by the acquisition of concepts the continuity of the physical world, e.g. a person who walks behind a screen has not vanished, it is accepted that he is still there temporarily there is no sense data to confirm it, but a hypothesis will be generated which supposes that, if he walked behind a screen at a constant speed, he ought to reappear at a given time at the other side of the screen.",9
966,Similarly it is soon accepted that the ‘ostrich’ theory of closing one's eyes and assuming that thereby either oneself or things in the environment will actually disappear is not tenable.,9
967,In this phase babies and young children enjoy ‘peep’ type games.,9
968,There is an important stage at which the person-centred world is superseded or rather supplemented by the world of which the person is one part.,9
969,Incidentally this is analogous to the distinction between displays which are ‘inside looking out’ and those which are ‘outside looking in’(p. 251).,9
970,"The perceptual system can function either way which is, , why each of the two types of display has its utility.",9
971,This development is one utilising pictorial skills as distinct from enactive skills.,9
972,"The latter are based on the body, its extensions and images, the former are based on internal ‘pictures’ of the world which are one kind of schema or mental model (see next section).",9
973,"Social skills are in principle more complex than perceptual-motor skills because the latter assume (correctly) a passive world which will react neutrally, the laws of physics.",9
974,"occasional feelings to the contrary, usually described as good or bad luck, the physical world is neither for nor against the actions of the individual (except in the robotic sense of Le Chatilier's principle which states that whenever a constraint is placed on a system in equilibrium, the equilibrium is altered in such a way as to annul the efforts of the constraint).",9
975,In social situations it has to be recognised that there is one other sentient being present who has his own objectives which might accord with or oppose those of the first person.,9
976,"Thus, social skills involve assessing the skills of the other person, a process known as mutual construing.",9
977,The evidence about the constructs of another person is indirect and may have been deliberately obscured or falsified.,9
978,"Nevertheless, it is true for all skills that a person developing skills is indulging in a process of constructing models of what is happening externally.",9
979,These models develop continuously while attempting to modify the external situation (physical or social).,9
980,"What seems to happen is that an individual, given his arrival in a situation, reviews it in the context of his own objectives and decides that if he takes certain actions, the situation will change in the direction of his objectives.",9
981,"He then takes the action, observes the changes and compares them with his stored version of those expected.",9
982,"If they correspond, then all is well, his concept of the situation is confirmed and he can progress to the next step in the context of his objectives.",9
983,"If, however, the observed changes are not what was predicted, then he has made an error but he has also learned because he must now modify his view of the situation accordingly.",9
984,", I might decide the angle of light on my desk is not as I require it on the basis of assessing the illumination and the lamp which is the source of it.",9
985,I hypothesise that if I move and turn the lamp in a particular way I will get the result I want.,9
986,"So I reach out, move and turn the lamp and check the result.",9
987,"If the result is as intended there has been no learning but equally none was needed because I understood the situation, I achieved my objective and I can move on to other  problems.",9
988,In a more complex case I might sit in on a discussion within a committee but begin to consider that it is not moving in a direction that suits me.,9
989,"I therefore form a hypothesis about an appropriate contribution based on the proposition being considered, the associated facts and logic, the personalities of my fellow committee members and my own standing within the committee.",9
990,I then state my proposition and observe its effects.,9
991,"If I get the result I wanted there is consolidation extension of my committee skills, but if I do not get the result I wanted then I have learned something and I form a new hypothesis about my next interjection strengthened by this new learning.",9
992,It will be noted that errors are the basis of further skill acquisition.,9
993,"Facilitating the acquisition of skill is a matter of providing situations where the skill can be practised with adequate, sometimes enhanced, feedback there can be learning from mistakes.",9
994,"The necessary conditions for learning are feedback and motivation, the result of actions must matter to the individual.",9
995,"All this is quite generally true, it applies equally to motor skills, perceptual skills and social skills.",9
996,Mental models,9
997,The principles of perception indicate that the human operator does not react unambiguously to stimuli which arrive via the sensory mechanisms (p. 196).,9
998,To assume that he responds directly to data from the real world is to oversimplify the relationship between his inputs and outputs.,9
999,"The skill model described above implies that, except in highly restricted artificial situations, his information processing must be described patterns of stimuli related to patterns of responses.",9
1000,It is also true that responses are a function of enormous differences between and within individuals.,9
1001,"To encompass all these parameters, it is currently fashionable to describe the person as responding his mental model of the situation to the situation itself.",9
1002,"The idea is that any person in any situation builds an internal model of the situation which is being reported to him, , by sensory data.",9
1003,He uses each perceptual datum to update his model of the situation.,9
1004,The model is his picture of what is going on outside him and it is essentially an hypothesis based on the available evidence.,9
1005,"This theory explains nicely why he sometimes does not react in tune with his own interests, , he gets it wrong.",9
1006,In these circumstances he is considered to have developed a model which does not bridge the gap between reality and his aspirations.,9
1007,These models are most easy to visualise in pictorial terms — the human operator has his internal picture which topographically matches the real world.,9
1008,"Models can, however, be simpler than these and can take the form of rules or they can be more complex in that symbolism can be used.",9
1009,Thus a model  can be entirely abstract using symbols which have no pictorial quality as in the use of language and mathematics.,9
1010,"Even when a picture is used, it is not complete, it takes the form of an icon which contains what the perceiver considers matters at the time.",9
1011,", a person working in a room with or without other people can easily develop the misconception that he has a complete picture in his mind of the physical environment.",9
1012,"In fact the picture is complete only in the sense that it contains the details which are relevant to his activity in that room, it certainly does not contain all the detail which is available to the senses.",9
1013,This is readily demonstrated by asking him to close his eyes and answer questions ‘is there a picture on the wall on the left?’ or ‘what colour are the eyes of the person you are talking to?’,9
1014,This is the kind of data which is not relevant to his objectives and thus it is not recorded in his model.,9
1015,On the other hand he will be able to answer questions ‘is the door behind you to the left or to the right?’ because he has used that door and needs to use it again.,9
1016,He knows where it is he cannot currently see it.,9
1017,Thus the visually-based mental picture is invariably an icon in the literal sense of a ‘symbolic representation’ a complete reproduction.,9
1018,At a more abstract level the mathematician or scientist will perform manipulations within a set of symbols which follow certain rules but neither the symbols nor the rules need have direct representation in reality.,9
1019,Indeed any attempt to relate them prematurely to reality may restrict the development of the model.,9
1020,"However, at some stage he will return to reality and say, , ‘what this means in practice or my next experiment…’",9
1021,The skilled thinker has an extraordinary facility not only to develop varieties of abstract models but also to switch rapidly between them and between them and reality.,9
1022,The switching takes place up and down a hierarchy of abstraction and generality.,9
1023,Consider the maintenance engineer operating as a diagnostician.,9
1024,He will look at a piece of equipment to try to detect signs which indicate what is wrong.,9
1025,Is there a gap or a hole which indicates a leak?,9
1026,Is there a part which is too hot?,9
1027,Most of this information comes not so much from what is happening but from what is not happening.,9
1028,"Basically the thing is not working as it should, the outputs are not as they should be so he will probably begin by checking that the inputs are present, that is the electric power or fuel or other materials are available.",9
1029,"He will then envisage the designed chain of events between input and output and look for the hiatus, he may do this by rules, by a pictorial model or by a model involving some symbolism expected voltage levels.",9
1030,"He will shift very rapidly between different representations of the equipment; the thing itself, his maintenance instructions, the manual, the drawings of the system, verbal discussion with a colleague, his recollection of  what has happened to it in the past .",9
1031,"He may think bits of equipment, flows of material, flows of energy or flows of information.",9
1032,He will shift through levels of generality and levels of abstraction until he has formulated an hypothesis which takes the form of ‘if I do this — that should happen’.,9
1033,He will then perform an action and check its results.,9
1034,"There are many interesting facets of this complex diagnostic process and three are worthy of re-emphasis: firstly most of his information comes not from positive signals, stimuli or cues but from their absence, secondly he is relying on a hybrid model — a mixture of rules, mental pictures and symbolism, thirdly it all happens without very much conscious guidance — one mental or physical event leads to another and each event in the chain plays its part before handing over to the next one.",9
1035,There is some analogy with a control system used in early naval warfare.,9
1036,"There was not one ship permanently in command, the particular ship in most direct contact with the enemy was in command until the leading position was taken over by another ship which then assumed command action.",9
1037,The working situation is different from the training school and even more from the educational system.,9
1038,"However it does seem that mental models can be developed in the abstract without the need to resort to action, in other words it is possible to learn while sitting passively in a class-room.",9
1039,Education or abstract learning does seem to take the form mainly of symbolic modelling and the relating of these models to reality awaits later practical experience.,9
1040,"The great asset of symbolic modelling is just this, learning does not have to depend entirely on practice and it is possible for collective knowledge to accumulate.",9
1041,This knowledge is communicated between people by the use of shared models.,9
1042,"Conversely, abstract communication cannot take place without the development of appropriate models.",9
1043,", the technical teacher is trying to convey various models to his pupils, some of the models will be physically based as in describing particular machines or systems and some will be functionally based as when he talks about thermodynamics or communication.",9
1044,What the teacher is trying to do is to guide each pupil into developing a set of mental models which have been found by experience or experiment to be useful in understanding technical processes.,9
1045,Having developed these models the pupil is in a position to communicate much more readily with other technical people who can manipulate similar models.,9
1046,"Conversely, this communication between specialists will be incomprehensible to those who do not have the expertise which resides in this particular set of models.",9
1047,Even between technical peers as in a design team there can be difficulties in communication because the models which individuals are using are not identical.,9
1048,"Debate, demonstration and other communications take place until a common modelling is accepted.",9
1049,"When there is disagreement, there is much to be said for retreating specifically to consider the model the problem.",9
1050,"Correspondingly, when there is a complex situation to discuss there can be considerable dividends in attempting to get an agreed model ‘on the table’ before considering specific issues.",9
1051,This is what briefing sessions are intended to accomplish.,9
1052,This approach also explains why engineers and ergonomists sometimes have difficulties in reaching agreement.,9
1053,The former is likely to be using mechanism-based models with people as ancillaries while the ergonomist will be using models of people with mechanisms as ancillaries.,9
1054,For good cooperation it is essential that the engineer has some grasp of ergonomics and that the ergonomist understands in general terms the technical situation in the particular industry.,9
1055,There can still be disagreements there is clear mutual understanding because underlying values result in the assessment of very different priorities.,9
1056,"In summary, communication, whether between a person and the physical world or between people, involves each person in developing and manipulating a mental model by interacting with the situation.",9
1057,Modelling the physical world and modelling other people's models share the same developmental procedures.,9
1058,Understanding what a person is doing requires an appreciation of the kind and content of the models that that person holds.,9
1059,Knowledge,9
1060,Individual differences,9
1061,"Capacities, abilities and aptitudes",9
1062,It is useful to discriminate between a which is a natural endowment and an which is a competence to act.,9
1063,"A capacity relates to an ability through an intervening phase of education, training and experience.",9
1064,"Thus an ability represents what a person can do now, whereas a capacity is essentially a potential.",9
1065,An is demonstrated by success in learning which results in the acquisition of an ability.,9
1066,An aptitude is therefore a capacity plus an inclination or interest.,9
1067,Ability and skill are often used interchangeably although ability is the wider term.,9
1068,An ability is made up of a repertoire of skills and is thus a higher level skill.,9
1069,Ability and capacity are often confused for several reasons.,9
1070,Human resources might be expressed either since capacities can be transformed into abilities by training.,9
1071,"Strictly we can only measure abilities but much psychometric testing aims to infer capacities from the measured abilities, e.g. intelligence tests.",9
1072,All three terms are attributes of individuals intended to describe their distinction from other individuals.,9
1073,All are used loosely because there are no  taxonomies which are either comprehensive or rigorous.,9
1074,", it would be unduly ambitious to claim to be able to describe a complete range of human abilities and the descriptors used for particular abilities are not always separable.",9
1075,The same is true for capacities and aptitudes.,9
1076,The best known attempt to provide a comprehensive structure of human abilities is that Guilford (1967).,9
1077,"His model contains about 120 different abilities, it is not currently very popular with psychometricians.",9
1078,"The only unambiguous categorisations of people are by physical size, age and sex.",9
1079,None of these is uniquely related to abilities but nevertheless age and sex are useful parameters.,9
1080,Age in particular correlates with some of the parameters which affect choice of work and performance at work.,9
1081,Intelligence and personality,9
1082,"There is no agreed definition of intelligence although a century of experience has accumulated in attempts to measure it (Friedman .,",9
1083,1981).,9
1084,Intelligence defined as that which is measured by intelligence tests is obviously circular and also variable as the fashions in intelligence testing change.,9
1085,", the attempt in the past thirty years to incorporate more divergent factors changes the emphasis towards inductive and creative abilities.",9
1086,This supplements the consideration of deductive and logical abilities measured by the traditional convergent questions for which there are unique correct answers.,9
1087,"the absence of a sound theory, the concept is operationally useful.",9
1088,"Intelligence is a descriptor of the quality of mental functioning, the ceiling of intellectual manipulation to which the individual can rise.",9
1089,High achievers in technically demanding fields are always intelligent although the converse is not true.,9
1090,", there are many intelligent individuals who are not high achievers.",9
1091,It follows that a particular score from an intelligence appraisal can be a useful cut-off point those who do not attain the cut-off should not be expected to cope with the demands of the particular task.,9
1092,"However, a high score does not necessarily predict success in a high level job.",9
1093,The intelligence test can be a useful source of evidence about individuals who are considered for lower level jobs.,9
1094,For more senior jobs individuals will have already demonstrated an appropriate level of intelligence by their educational standards and successful work experience.,9
1095,"the principles of defining the relevant abilities reliable test measures, intelligence can be divided into verbal ability, arithmetical ability, reasoning ability and spatial ability.",9
1096,For more extensive discussion see Eysenck (1979).,9
1097,There is a long established distinction in psychology between cognitive and conative aspects of behaviour.,9
1098,"Cognition is to do with the rational domain: logic, reasoning and problem solving uncomplicated by irrational behaviour.",9
1099,"Conation is to do with the emotional domain: feeling, caring and striving.",9
1100,Intelligence is connected with cognition but personality incorporates conation.,9
1101,Thus Freudian theory is regarded as a personality theory.,9
1102,Clearly if we wish to describe the whole person conative aspects must be included.,9
1103,Unfortunately personality testing is much less well developed than intelligence testing.,9
1104,"The best known personality tests are the Minnesota Multiphase Personality Inventory (M.M.P.I.), Catell's test (16 P.F.), and the Eysenck Personality Inventory (E.P.I.).",9
1105,For details see Kline (1976).,9
1106,These are self-report inventories where the testee has the possibility of cheating in that he can respond with an answer which he considers will give him a good score providing a completely truthful one.,9
1107,Such manipulation of answers is less feasible with tests where the testee is asked to respond to a highly ambiguous situation and his response is presumed to reflect his personality the situation.,9
1108,"The presentation might be a picture (thematic apperception test), an ink-blot (Rorschach test) or prose (sentence completion test).",9
1109,The difficulty about using these tests is how to score the responses with any reasonable hope of reliability validity.,9
1110,"There are other tests which relate indirectly to personality, namely interest tests.",9
1111,Here the testee is presented with a set of questions or checklists which steer him into trying to think carefully about his own interests.,9
1112,The best known ones are the Kuder Preference test and the Strong-Campbell interest inventory.,9
1113,They are particularly useful in occupational guidance (Nelson-Jones 1982).,9
1114,Age differences,9
1115,"The extremes of the age range, children and old people, are outside the scope of this book.",9
1116,The working age range is 15 to 65 years.,9
1117,"This is not to suggest that those outside this range never work, but rather that in advanced countries gainful employment is considered to be mainly the responsibility of those in this particular age band of 50 years.",9
1118,This band is currently contracting even further in European societies.,9
1119,"the rise in unemployment it is now becoming standard that almost all those in the 15–18 age range are in education or training schemes and retirement is increasingly common from 55 years upwards, particularly from manufacturing industry.",9
1120,"Nevertheless, from both physiological and psychological viewpoints, ageing is regarded as a continuous process considerable changes can be expected between 1 8 and 55 years.",9
1121,"Using the information processing model of receptor, central and effector processes (Welford, 1958; Birren and Schaie, 1977), changes occur in all these processes.",9
1122,"The receptors diminish in  efficiency: there are consistent changes in visual acuity and changes in sensitivity to light, the threshold of hearing increases particularly for higher frequencies.",9
1123,The effector processes become slower and less powerful but these effects are not so marked or so consistent.,9
1124,The main change in central processes seems to be decreased short-term memory which results in performance which is less rapid and more deliberate; measured intelligence falls slightly but not very much within the working age range.,9
1125,"This may seem to be a gloomy picture but it must be noted that, work, age is not a large aspect of individual differences compared with natural endowment, and that increases in ability can more than compensate for small decreases in capacity.",9
1126,"Wellord (1979) suggests that work on the shop-floor is likely to peak in the thirties — those in their twenties lack experience and social skills, those in their forties are beginning to notice the effect of sensory changes and are less tolerant of fast or very heavy physical work.",9
1127,"On the other hand, from the forties onwards there is likely to be greater stability in the sense that individuals are more settled in their jobs and ambitions and are supported by less rapidly changing domestic and leisure situations.",9
1128,The effectiveness of training can be maintained if the training scheme incorporates features smaller learning steps and ‘discovery learning’ where the trainee proceeds at his own pace using his own strategies (Belbin 1965).,9
1129,"For more senior positions there are more subtle attributes self-knowledge and the ability to see ‘the big picture’ which increase with age, these are the reasons why most institutions and societies rely on older leaders (Singleton, 1983b).",9
1130,Sex differences,9
1131,"There is surprisingly little research on the differences in work performance which are traceable to sex differences, and the situation is complicated in many countries by the inclusion of sex as one of the variables where discrimination is legally inadmissible.",9
1132,"Incidentally, in this book ‘man’, ‘he’ and ‘him’are used as generic terms covering both sexes.",9
1133,"There can be no argument that, on average, women are physically smaller than men, and there are other features the greater proportion of fatty tissue which give men the advantage tolerance of heat stress and physical effort involving fast or heavy work or awkward posture.",9
1134,"On the other hand in Russia, , where so many males were lost in two world wars women do do much heavier work than is traditional in Western countries.",9
1135,Similarly there seem to be many cultures in tropical countries where the women get on with the necessary work while the men sit around discussing matters.,9
1136,There appear to be no important differences in performance on intelligence tests in the working age range and as the influence of physical effort in work becomes less important so it is more feasible that jobs can be performed equally well by either sex.,9
1137,The overall situation was reviewed by Hoiberg (1982).,9
1138,Equal opportunity legislation exists in most advanced countries but this is not yet reflected in equal pay rates.,9
1139,The average wage of women workers is two-thirds that of men.,9
1140,Part-time work seems to be a prerogative of women presumably as a consequence of their central role in the home.,9
1141,"Educational opportunity varies, depending mainly on family attitudes.",9
1142,"In some cultures sons are given priority, others give daughters priority, following the McIver principle ‘when you educate a man you educate an individual: when you educate a woman you educate a whole family’.",9
1143,"Ethics, cultural, climatic and economic differences",9
1144,"This is a sensitive topic on which to conduct research or establish principles with the consequence that, the extensive effort (Triandis .,",9
1145,1980) there is not a great deal of knowledge established beyond argument.,9
1146,Climate and economics need to be included because these factors may well determine features which at first sight might be attributed to ethnic or cultural factors.,9
1147,Clearly the work that people do is determined by the level of technology which is related to overall wealth.,9
1148,Ways of working and locations of work are also affected by climate.,9
1149,", in a tropical country shoes may still be made in the open air by a craftsman who uses his feet his hands to hold and manipulate materials.",9
1150,"In a temperate country shoes are made in a factory by workers who are process controllers craftsmen, and they touch the materials only when loading or unloading machines.",9
1151,For these and many other reasons the practice of ergonomics in developing countries is different from that in advanced countries (p. 155).,9
1152,The acquisition of skills is governed by the current needs of particular societies and by the adaptation of individuals within the societies in which they happen to find themselves.,9
1153,Research on the influence of cultural factors on intelligence testing and test results have been conducted on a wide scale and the results are endlessly discussed the inextricable mixture of technical and value judgments.,9
1154,As Crombach puts it in the foreword to Irvine and Berry (1981)‘the progress is as much in the psychology of the investigators as in the investigations being reported’.,9
1155,As in other fields of behavioural study there are three phases.,9
1156,In the first phase techniques and theories are developed in the West.,9
1157,"In the second phase Western practitioners try out their ideas in other cultures and many new insights emerge by comparisons and contrasts, it becomes clear that some of the principles thought to be valid for ‘man’ turn out to be valid only for man in Western cultures.",9
1158,"In the third phase scientists from other cultures acquire these concepts, develop them further in their indigenous environment and provide penetrating comments on Western ideas and their application from an external viewpoint (Crombach and Drenth, 1972).",9
1159,The dominant influence of culture on the direction of human development implies that descriptions of human abilities cannot be context free.,9
1160,"Specific cultures are themselves dynamic, they change under the influence of technology.",9
1161,"Ergonomics cannot be simply the adaptation of technology to suit invariant properties of ‘man’, people change with technology.",9
1162,Learning,9
1163,Learning has been a major topic within academic psychology for the past century or so.,9
1164,"The nineteenth century work of Pavlov on the conditioned reflex generated vain hopes that psychology, and learning, might be studied by a rigorous methodology closely allied to physiology.",9
1165,It was assumed that all learning could be reduced to a series of conditioned reflexes.,9
1166,"There was extensive research in this behaviourist tradition (Hilgard and Marquis, 1940) mostly on the laboratory rat.",9
1167,So called verbal learning in man was studied by a similar process of scoring repetitive performance.,9
1168,"Reliance on such data produced the systematic behaviour theories of Thorndike, Hull and Skinner.",9
1169,"There was a parallel although less popular theoretical development based on Gestalt psychology which resulted in the field theories of Lewin, Wheeler and Tolman (Hilgard, 1948).",9
1170,"There were many attempts to devise taxonomies of learning which used particular theories as descriptive of different kinds of learning (Melton, 1964).",9
1171,At this stage there seemed to be little connection between the vast experience of learning in practice within educational and training systems and learning as conceived by psychologists on the basis of laboratory experiments.,9
1172,"The psychologists attempted to polarise various issues massed versus spaced learning, whole versus part learning and transfer of training which had some face validity in appearing to identify general principles, but in practice it always seemed that the generalities vanished into the enormous variety of specific issues.",9
1173,The answer always differed with the particular situation.,9
1174,Gagne (1970) attempted to produce a theory which was germane to educational problems by switching the emphasis from categories to conditions of learning.,9
1175,The deliberate attempt to link learning to the design of instruction provided the necessary discipline to treat learning as a practical a theoretical issue.,9
1176,The eight types of learning which Gagne distinguishes are shown in Table 2.2.,9
1177,"Gagne also separated four   phases of a learning sequence; apprehension, acquisition, storage and retrieval.",9
1178,"The apprehension phase includes attending and perceiving, that is accepting new information.",9
1179,"Acquisition is not easy to separate from either apprehension on one side or storage on the other, but it implies that learning has taken place in that something new can now be done if appropriate.",9
1180,The distinction from apprehension is necessary to incorporate the phenomenon that it is possible to understand a situation in one sense without knowing what to do about it.,9
1181,Correspondingly acquisition is different from storage the latter implies a formal recording possibly in short-term or possibly in long-term memory.,9
1182,"Finally retrieval is a separate process another familiar phenomenon that it is possible to know something, that is it must be in storage, but not actually succeed in retrieving it at a particular time.",9
1183,These phases and the difficulties of separating them reflect the fact that mental processes are not clearly defined distinctions and boundaries.,9
1184,"all educational psychologists Gagne is also restricted by reliance on evidence which comes mostly from laboratory experiments, usually on lower animals, with all the limitations and artefacts which this implies.",9
1185,"More subtly he is also restricted by attempting to set the knowledge in another artificial situation, the educational process of sitting in classrooms learning by rote leavened by some understanding and being examined and tested in standardised situations.",9
1186,Thomas and Harri-Augstein (1985) attempt a more autonomous approach to learning in two senses.,9
1187,", learning need not be restricted to the  orthodox educational system and also that learning, as a process, is essentially self-centred, and self-organised.",9
1188,This approach follows the tradition of Rogers (1951) who developed client-centred therapy and Kelly (1955) who developed personal construct theory.,9
1189,The emphasis is on the individual who inevitably has a unique view of the world which he continuously modifies experience.,9
1190,Each view of the world can be described using personal constructs which can be elicited by the use of a Repertory Grid.,9
1191,The individual reflects on his own experience and is thus continuously involved in both internal and external conversations.,9
1192,Learning takes place as a result of these conversations.,9
1193,"Traditional distinctions between teaching, training and therapy disappear, so also does the conceptual distinction between cognition and conation.",9
1194,One attractive aspect of this theory is that it highlights the way in which formal instruction can inhibit learning by not allowing sufficient scope for self-expression and self-development — alienation following submission to being taught learning how to learn.,9
1195,"The emphasis on self does not limit the application to individual activity, shared meaning can be negotiated and developed within groups, this is group learning.",9
1196,"Correspondingly the teacher is not redundant, a competent teacher is a learning manager and so also is every parent, manager or counsellor, their task is to provide the conditions and facilitate the process of self-development.",9
1197,If learning is defined as the improvement of specific performance following experience of that performance then organisations individuals can be said to learn.,9
1198,Paradoxically much of the more abstract work on the mathematical theory of learning curves has its application in principle in the requirements of accountants and production engineers.,9
1199,"The process of making anything from a switch to a civil airliner is improvements in speed, quality and cost reduction which follow the characteristic learning curve.",9
1200,It is obviously important to the managers of such organisations to be able to predict by how much the process will improve after particular lengths of time and numbers of products made.,9
1201,"Conversely, the universal very steep learning curves with early experience, any novel enterprise is bound to have extensive teething troubles, which should be allowed for they are not predictable .",9
1202,"Experiments, trials, prototypes and the running in parallel of old and new systems are all valuable, almost essential procedures — when something radical is being attempted on any scale from a new car suspension to a new educational system.",9
1203,Technology and society generally is continuously in trouble because this elementary principle is forgotten or ignored by enthusiastic innovators.,9
1204,Memory and thinking,9
1205,Thinking is essentially an internal activity although it is stimulated and aided by interaction with the external world including other people.,9
1206,Since it takes place ‘inside’ it must be related to memory.,9
1207,This is one of several complications of the simplistic view that memory is just a store.,9
1208,Another is that a store is useless without means of access and egress.,9
1209,In other words there must be processes of recording and retrieval and the underlying mechanisms must be closely integrated with the mechanism of the store.,9
1210,The store or stores are almost certainly active passive records of events and knowledge these also are best considered as processes.,9
1211,Early studies of memory by psychologists concentrated on apparatus the memory drum which was used to measure the ability to associate verbal items.,9
1212,In the pursuit of generality these items were often nonsense syllables.,9
1213,This is another example of the way in which the attempt to standardise human performance can negate the purpose of study.,9
1214,There is a built-in assumption that memory is about association and a removal of any possibility of demonstrating that memory might be dependent on meaning.,9
1215,Other early studies of memory attempted to measure capacity by data the length of a number series which could be accurately reproduced after one presentation.,9
1216,"The answer turns out to be about seven (Woodworth, 1938).",9
1217,These studies of immediate memory span are of more than historical interest because the fact that there is such a severe limit is important in the design of information presentations of technical data — a standard ergonomics problem.,9
1218,"Other significant phenomena which have emerged from such studies are that simple reversals of the numbers are a common form of error, accurate reproduction is facilitated by deliberate grouping in twos or threes and the ends of a span seem to be less prone to error than the middle.",9
1219,"With the advent of information theory (Attneave, 1959; Edwards, 1964) other interesting issues arose whether the performance of the store could better be measured bits of information or chunks of material (the bits-versus-chunks controversy (Miller, 1956)) and the possibility that memory processes might distinguish between content and order.",9
1220,The simple memory span measure confounds these variables.,9
1221,Clearly there is more to memory than the reproduction of numbers or lists and another distinction which has arisen is between episodic and semantic memory.,9
1222,"The former is concerned with specific events and the latter is relatively context free (Baddeley, 1976).",9
1223,A parallel but not identical distinction is between short-term and long-term memory.,9
1224,"Short-term memory has capacity limits and is readily purged, it probably keeps a record of the current situation, whereas the long-term memory is the repository of principles and strategies.",9
1225,Both these distinctions imply that registration in storage continues long past the time of reception of information.,9
1226,this implies shifting to different stores is not known.,9
1227,"In functional terms there do seem to be storage facilities relatively near the entry channels through the senses, those for the visual and auditory systems are called respectively the iconic store and the echoic store (Wickens, 1984).",9
1228,"These stores have available a literal record of the stimulus the observer can, , internally inspect them but such impressions decay very rapidly, typically in ten seconds.",9
1229,In an elegant series of experiments Conrad (1964) demonstrated that in transposing visually presented data the errors are more likely to be in numbers or letters of similar sound those which are of similar appearance.,9
1230,This suggests that this short-term store is  visually based the task is visual-motor.,9
1231,"The effect diminishes if there is irrelevant articulatory activity at the time, this raises the possibility that there may be pre-output stores post-input stores, almost literally memory in the fingers.",9
1232,"If an experienced operator of a complex console of switches is asked where a particular switch is he will often touch it and check what he has touched, the action precedes the recall and recall precedes recognition.",9
1233,"The distinction between recall and recognition is clearly an important one, the human memory is so much superior in the latter function.",9
1234,We may be totally unable to recall an event or a fact but recognise it and all its context immediately if it is presented.,9
1235,Again there seems to be a distinction between what and when.,9
1236,"Any busy person will recall that he has a particular engagement but will have only a sparse internal record of when this commitment will arise, hence the importance of a diary.",9
1237,"If asked to recall a date such a person will proceed by inference by a direct introspective search, e.g. ‘it cannot be next week but it must be within the next month’ or ‘this kind of event is always on a Tuesday’.",9
1238,This is one illustration of the process which Bartlett (1932) called ‘turning round on one's own schemata’—‘I am in this state therefore this must be so’ the direct retrieval from a store.,9
1239,"In Bartlett's view long-term memory involves the reconstruction of events, such remembering is bias and distortion not only from  but also from the context and even the culture.",9
1240,It is in this sense that memory is a consequence of the continuously modified record of experience (p. 100) a separate function.,9
1241,"The analogy of the ego or self, the internal little man consulting personal records is attractive but misleading.",9
1242,"One dubious consequence is that the short-term memory, of limited capacity compared with the virtually infinite  capacity of long-term memory, is conceived as the internal stage on which exhibits from the store are manipulated.",9
1243,This is one view of thinking but again it is thinking restricted by the limitations of the laboratory situation where the problem must be easily assimilated and the proposed solution is readily measurable.,9
1244,"Psychological research on thinking has been the province of the field theorists, the gestalt psychologists (Humphrey, 1951).",9
1245,"There was considerable debate within this school about the overlapping concepts of motive, determining tendency and set.",9
1246,Some such concept is required to explain why different individuals reach different solutions in diagnosing and providing remedies for particular situations.,9
1247,These ideas have recently been revived by the concept of ‘mind-set’ to describe why errors are made in coping with complex system failures.,9
1248,Craik (1943) considered that thinking paralleled reality in that within the mind there must be a model of reality which can be manipulated independently of the outside world.,9
1249,"The advantages of such a mechanism are clear, it is possible to manipulate the model and thus understand the outside world in the sense of predicting what will happen without the potential costs of attempting to manipulate the real world and allowing things to happen, some of which might be considered to be unfortunate.",9
1250,"Using technology, this process can now be partially externalised in that, , a simulation of a situation can be run in parallel with a real situation and can be manipulated independently of what happens in real time.",9
1251,Bartlett (1958) regarded thinking as a form of skill in that it has the characteristics of organising information.,9
1252,A situation can be structured and comprehended to indicate a direction for proceeding.,9
1253,"In technological situations there is often also a timing characteristic, evidence is developing and at some point in the future, which itself has to be determined, something will have to be done.",9
1254,"One attribute of thinking perception is that the evidence is relatively less complete, gaps have to be filled either within or beyond the available data.",9
1255,This is achieved on the basis of past experience and interests.,9
1256,Inevitably the product of thinking is a function of the thinker of the situation.,9
1257,"Past experience is brought to bear on a new situation by a categorisation, a process regarded as central to thinking by Bruner and his colleagues (1956).",9
1258,Classification must be a function not only of the situation but also of the existing internalised classes and their relative accessibility.,9
1259,Bruner (1957) discusses the classical problem of determining tendency as ‘perceptual readiness’ and notes also the problem that the first classification can mask a more appropriate classification.,9
1260,This relates to a currently important limitation in fault diagnosis for technological systems where a first hypothesis about the cause of the problem can inhibit flexibility in considering other possible causes.,9
1261,The above ideas were generated mainly on the basis of experiments and it is not surprising that many of the key characteristics of thinking in real situations were not given sufficient weight.,9
1262,"These include the use of evidence arising from the absence of events their presence, the cost-effectiveness criterion in pursuing evidence and reasoning processes based on extensive experience intellectual analysis.",9
1263,"More recent work on observation of, experiment with thinking (Johnson-Laird and Wason, 1977) goes some way to restoring the balance in appraising all the relevant parameters in a real situation where thinking is taking place.",9
1264,There is also a dearth of evidence about thinking by groups.,9
1265,"This is surprising the time which people spend in committees, task forces and the like.",9
1266,"There is experimental work on issues kinds of group organisation, e.g. autocratic versus democratic versus laissez-faire (Sherif, 1948) and on the group dynamics of people interactions (Lewin, 1935) but little work on the process of problem solving by groups.",9
1267,The collective mind in action is clearly an important topic but it seems to be a challenge which psychologists have not yet taken up.,9
1268,"It is important in education in gainful employment (Singleton, 1983a).",9
1269,Language,9
1270,"There has been extensive work on the psychology of language (Campbell and Smith, 1976; Gerver and Sinaiko, 1978), but with a greater emphasis on language as an interpersonal communication vehicle language as a supporter of thinking.",9
1271,"The work of Piaget (1950) and Chomsky (1957) is essentially about thinking and language or psycholinguistics, but these authors did not concern themselves with the level of problem which arises when, , a physiologist and a psychologist attempt to exchange mutually supportive ideas.",9
1272,"Herriot (1970, 1974), however, makes some interesting suggestions about the relationship between language, schema, strategies and deep structure.",9
1273,"As he sees it, deep structure is represented in schemata which relate non-linguistic and linguistic thinking.",9
1274,"Language and indeed behaviour generally is necessarily ordered and is represented internally as strategies, schemata are not inherently sequential and thinking can thus be concerned with context before the constraint of achieving is introduced to generate an output.",9
1275,"Thinking regarded as internal manipulation of events and ideas does not necessarily depend on language, but if it is not entirely ego orientated, that is not concentrated on the relationship of the person to the scheme of things, then it usually invokes iconic representation.",9
1276,Designers of computer based support for thinking beyond the level of merely providing additional information will  hopefully begin to simultaneously use and develop these ideas.,9
1277,Effective computer support must be matched to human thinking communication is readily established and yet different in providing functions which supplement human thinking (p. 233).,9
1278,Learning and memory,9
1279,The learner must have the drive to learn and he must also have knowledge of the results of his activities.,9
1280,1.,9
1281,Behaviour at a higher skilled level is characterised by selectivity in choice of inputs and outputs and by increasing influence of the past and the future the immediate situation.,9
1282,2.,9
1283,"Learning is an activity of an individual, else can do it for him.",9
1284,"Educators and trainers can do no more than provide the conditions, the content and the materials.",9
1285,3.,9
1286,Social skills and communication generally depend on the detection and definition of mutually agreed internal models of reality.,9
1287,4.,9
1288,"The human memory, every other store, has to be positively consulted before it will function.",9
1289,"This is not a limitation, it is essential for coherent behaviour, there would be chaos if material emerged without prompting.",9
1290,"The trigger is usually some external stimulus, not necessarily an obvious one.",9
1291,"It might be a particular smell, a particular melody or a brief glimpse of a person resembling one of the actors in an event which is then recalled.",9
1292,This facility for associations which are neither obvious nor apparently logical is extremely valuable in creative thinking and problem solving.,9
1293,The converse of positively trying to recall some fact the name of a person is curious blockages which are not understood.,9
1294,5.,9
1295,Given the alternative of storage internally in the mind or externally in a file (paper-based or computer-based) external records are much superior for literal reproductions in western societies (there is anecdotal evidence concerning illiterate traders in other cultures who seem to have remarkable memories for detailed facts and numbers connected with their personal business).,9
1296,"The capacity and flexibility of desk-top computers is now such that the optimal sharing of processing, storage and presentation of material between computer and operator may well be quite different from the traditional combination of human memory and material on paper.",9
1297,This topic is too recent for there to be many guidelines available but for a particular topic the designer can assume that he need not be inhibited in allowing his imagination to run to many kinds of novel solutions.,9
1298,6.,9
1299,There is a considerable art in developing the most effective combination of external and internal stores and reminders which every highly skilled person  deliberately cultivates.,9
1300,", there is no need to write in a diary ‘check in-tray and consult secretary’, these actions take place as routine following  at the office.",9
1301,"On the other hand a diary entry ‘ring X’ is effective and if the entry is some way in the future it may be necessary to amplify with a trigger of the form ‘ring X re Y’and to have easily accessible some factual data the X telephone number and some data re Y. In a different context a car driver will develop a strategy to ensure that he does not run petrol, he may rely on a light which appears when the tank is nearly empty or he may calculate from his expected travelling that he need not concern himself about the issue until the next weekend, or he may programme himself to react to the fact that he is approaching a particular garage.",9
1302,This self-programming goes on continuously with an implicit acknowledgment of the need for triggers and the relative advantages of various kinds of stores and stored materials.,9
1303,7.,9
1304,This self-organised work design has its parallel in designing tasks for others.,9
1305,In studying an elaborate sequence of events within a task the designer will systematically consider the need for appropriate triggers for the memory at specific points in the task.,9
1306,he will never rely on the operator spontaneously remembering to do something which has no natural place in the developing task (p. 56).,9
1307,8.,9
1308,There are three and probably many more levels of storage.,9
1309,"The sensory stores decay very rapidly, items are lost in ten seconds.",9
1310,"The short-term store has a limit of about twenty seconds unless there is opportunity for rehearsal, e.g. this is the maximum time available between looking up a telephone number and then dialling it unless the operator repeats it to himself.",9
1311,"Some kinds of long-term memory seem to endure indefinitely they have apparently been lost for a long time, e.g. an older person may find it easy to recall childhood events with great clarity there has been no use of the material for fifty or sixty years.",9
1312,9.,9
1313,There seems to be a memory for elaborate patterns and sequences which takes a long time to develop.,9
1314,a chemist will learn about compounds by laboriously memorising as a student the properties of each one separately but eventually sets of compounds are perceived as a pattern and thereafter all the relevant material is readily available because it fits together neatly.,9
1315,The corollary for the trainer is to look for patterns which exist in complex material and introduce the trainee to the patterns to the separate facts.,9
1316,Similarly an information presentation will be more readily comprehended if there is a detectable structure the ‘christmas tree’ method of working through a checklist.,9
1317,10.,9
1318,Errors in recall can be similar for different individuals.,9
1319,the propensity for simple reversals within a number sequence.,9
1320,"It follows that attempting to reduce error rates by one person checking another's performance or automatically comparing the output of the individuals simultaneously performing the same task is not as effective as it would be if errors in the sources were independent (Chapanis .,",9
1321,1949).,9
1322,"Principles, methods and procedures",9
1323,Interviewing,9
1324,An interview is a formal conversation in which there is a non-reciprocal relationship between the parties.,9
1325,It is formal there are purposes which define the reasons why the transaction is taking place.,9
1326,There is conversation which is usually face to face but may sometimes involve telecommunication.,9
1327,"It is non-reciprocal the two parties are never equivalent; one is the interviewer who has the initiative, the other is the interviewee.",9
1328,"The interviewing party may be a group facing one interviewee, e.g. a selection board.",9
1329,"The interviewed party may be a group facing one interviewer, e.g. a group of witnesses facing a reporter.",9
1330,Any transaction involving two groups or two equivalent individuals is regarded as a negotiation an interview.,9
1331,"The interview can be initiated by either side, e.g. by the interviewer when a more senior person calls a subordinate or by the interviewee when a patient calls a doctor.",9
1332,"The information transmission will inevitably be two-way but the main purpose may be transmission from interviewer to interviewee as in an appraisal interview, from interviewee to interviewer as in an opinion survey, or it may change direction during the course of the interview as in a patient-doctor interview.",9
1333,In this last case the interviewee begins by providing information which facilitates a diagnosis and the interviewer thereafter provides information about possible causes and remedies.,9
1334,"the universality and range of the interview situation it is not surprising that there has been extensive research, but for the same reasons the research is of little operational consequence.",9
1335,"Checks of interview effectiveness by, , having the same list of candidates ranked independently by two selection boards invariably indicates rather poor consistency.",9
1336,"On the other hand no manager willingly accepts a new member of staff without the use of a selection interview, no doctor will express a confident diagnosis without an interview with the patient, and no counsellor could function without meeting his clients face to face.",9
1337,"The key to the issue is that interviews except in the simplest case of surveys, to be discussed later, are not about acquiring factual evidence.",9
1338,This is best obtained by asking interviewees to complete standard forms or to take tests before or between interviews.,9
1339,"Information obtained  during an interview is about assessable but unquantifiable attributes attitudes, motivation, reliability, integrity, social ease .",9
1340,"In skill terminology the interviewer uses the interview to create a model in his mind which he can use to predict the behaviour of the individual interviewee in a work situation, a stress situation, an illness or whatever an interview is about.",9
1341,"Obviously he can create a better model if he knows what the interviewee looks like, how he dresses, talks and responds non-verbally.",9
1342,"Equally the interviewee forms a model of the interviewer(s) and this can be a considerable aid to his decision-making about whether he can respect, trust, work with or tolerate guidance from the interviewer.",9
1343,This interaction may or may not achieve a successful conclusion for both sides their level of skill.,9
1344,Attempting to do research on the interview is doomed to failure because the skills of the actors will dominate the success or otherwise of the proceedings.,9
1345,It should be remembered also that the interview is only one incident within a series of communication functions which aim towards one objective.,9
1346,", a work placement involves trawling for candidates, testing and form-filling and preliminary sifts before the interview followed by induction and training after the interview.",9
1347,Those responsible are interested in an effective total process not just an effective interview and all the stages in the process interact.,9
1348,"For these reasons it is difficult to generate principles of interviewing, there are always alternative viewpoints and exceptions.",9
1349,:,9
1350,1.,9
1351,Always try to put the interviewees at ease.,9
1352,For senior posts it can be instructive to do the opposite to see how far the candidate can cope with the stress.,9
1353,2.,9
1354,Always ask open-ended questions.,9
1355,"If the interviewee is very nervous it can help to ask some questions which can readily be answered with a yes or no, this provides the opportunity to adjust the tension.",9
1356,3.,9
1357,Do not make jokes.,9
1358,"Sometimes the interviewee exhibits too much respect creating a communication barrier, a demonstration that the interviewer is only human by a weak joke can remove this barrier.",9
1359,4.,9
1360,Always structure the interview to ensure that all essential points are covered.,9
1361,On the contrary a free-wheeling interview with direction changes as key points emerge can yield unexpected but valuable evidence.,9
1362,5.,9
1363,Assess the interviewee under various headings to obtain a comparable profile score.,9
1364,Part of the skill of the interviewer is in extracting different salient points from individuals and appropriately weighting totally disparate facets.,9
1365,"On the other hand it must be acknowledged that there are many bad interviews and, as always, improvement is possible by design, consideration of procedures and training.",9
1366,The design of the situation and the process should adhere to standard practices which have been found to be helpful by experience and commonsense.,9
1367,1.,9
1368,Obtain all the relevant factual data (biography and testscores) before the final interview.,9
1369,2.,9
1370,Provide a waiting room which has accessible toilet facilities including mirrors.,9
1371,3.,9
1372,"The interviewer should collect the interviewee, not have him sent for from the waiting room.",9
1373,4.,9
1374,Provide the interviewee with a written job aid which indicates the name and function of the interviewer(s).,9
1375,5.,9
1376,The relative positioning of the two main interactors and the direction of lighting are significant.,9
1377,The obvious ‘third-degree’ lighting should be avoided but not being able to see the  clearly is equally deleterious.,9
1378,"Face to face is the most formal, side by side the least formal, seating at right angles is often a suitable compromise.",9
1379,6.,9
1380,Provide the interviewee with opportunities to make points which have not been covered in questions and to ask other questions on matters important to him.,9
1381,"This is not mere courtesy, what the interviewee regards as important can be very revealing.",9
1382,7.,9
1383,Provide clear if indirect indications that the interview is ending.,9
1384,8.,9
1385,Tell the interviewee what the next stage in the process will be and when.,9
1386,9.,9
1387,"Escort the interviewee to the door, again the behaviour at the parting point can be significant.",9
1388,the above discussion training of interviewers and interviewees must necessarily be based on principles of training (p. 121) principles of interviewing.,9
1389,Role playing and case studies are often used and they can be effective in reducing self-unease (self-awareness and self-analysis are necessary attributes of the good interviewer in action) and highlighting idiosyncratic features mannerisms and biases.,9
1390,The most powerful tool of the interview trainer is the closed circuit television system.,9
1391,So powerful that it needs to be used circumspectly to avoid reducing self-confidence.,9
1392,Normally the trainer will go through a reproduced interview and discuss the good and bad points which are usually clearly evident.,9
1393,This provides salutary knowledge of results of the interview itself if not of its degree of success a real objective.,9
1394,"Randell (1978) suggests that an interviewing at work course can reasonably take two days covering ‘unfreezing’, conceptual analysis, technique development and  practice with feedback.",9
1395,"Rutter (1979) devised an interview training programme for medical students involving a history taking scheme and two video-taped 15 minute diagnostic sessions one week apart, with discussion feedback based on a nine-point method of scoring information elicited.",9
1396,These scores were also used to validate the training by comparing experimental and control groups.,9
1397,Psychological testing,9
1398,"The design and development of tests is a well established formal procedure involving checking for internal consistency and absence of ambiguity, efficiency of administration and marking procedures and the production of norms for definitive populations.",9
1399,There is a comprehensive list and description of available tests in the ‘’ which is updated at intervals of a few years.,9
1400,"The of a test is measured by correlation between the test scores, obtained at two different times, between different forms of the same test or between samples of questions in different parts of the same test.",9
1401,The interpretation of this measure of consistency is not as straightforward as it seems at first sight.,9
1402,", it has been pointed out that one person cannot be asked the same question twice, the second time he is not the same person because he has already been asked the question once.",9
1403,The of a test is an even more complex concept.,9
1404,It refers to the confidence the tester can attach to decisions based on the test scores.,9
1405,"There are three kinds of validity: construct validity which refers to the degree to which the test seems to be based on psychological theory, content validity which describes how well the test measures what it is intended to measure and criterion validity which indicates its value as a predictor using as criteria other measures of relevant performance.",9
1406,The problems of criterion validity nicely illustrate the difficulty of finding any solid foundation on which to construct a psychometric measure.,9
1407,Suppose that the purpose of a particular test is to predict success in a particular job.,9
1408,Even with hindsight this is not easy to determine.,9
1409,"The measure of success in a training course depends on the validity of the training course itself, supervisors' opinions based on experience of job performance are distortion by various biases and measured performance productivity is many vicissitudes independent of the ability of the producer.",9
1410,Faced with all these uncertainties the strategies adopted in the U.S.A. and Europe are different but usefully complementary.,9
1411,"The American approach is to be as formal and rigorous as possible with insistence on systematic sampling, correlating .",9
1412,The European approach is less tidy  and more humanistic with continuous questioning of philosophies and methodologies.,9
1413,"A good example of the latter is Heim (1970) in which intelligence and personality testing is discussed in the context of the meaning of intelligence, creativity, personality, test taking as a skill and the different but inseparable limitations of speed and accuracy based measures.",9
1414,"For further discussion of these elusive topics see Super and Bohn (1971), Drenth (1978) and Jessup and Jessup (1975).",9
1415,"The aim of psychological measurement is optimal discrimination between individuals, for this purpose the difficulty of the test should match the range of abilities of the testees.",9
1416,"an intelligence test may be too easy all testees have almost perfect scores, or too difficult in that all testees have very low scores, in both cases discrimination will be poor.",9
1417,One answer to this problem is in which questions are computer-based and the test is adaptive in focussing the range of presented questions at about the level of success/failure which is appropriate for each testee.,9
1418,"In this way discrimination is much improved without excessively lengthening the test time (Killcross and Cassie, 1975).",9
1419,The value and extent of the use of tests is other changes in the history of the particular community.,9
1420,Obviously testing can be extensively utilised in war-time when many people are changing jobs both in military and civilian life.,9
1421,"In peace-time the selection ratio, the ratio of applicants to available jobs is a key feature, there tends to be more testing in times of economic depression when jobs are scarce and also in post-war periods when there is extensive experience of using tests.",9
1422,"The use of tests is not, , confined to selection procedures.",9
1423,Indeed there is currently much greater utilisation in guidance and therapy.,9
1424,Surveys,9
1425,"tests, surveys are required to be as reliable and valid as is feasible in the circumstances.",9
1426,"Surveys are however different from tests in their objective: a test is usually carried out to find out about an individual, a survey is carried out to find out about an issue which is across people.",9
1427,The issue itself must be specified as precisely as possible usually both what we want to know and why we want to know.,9
1428,‘Why’ will clarify ‘what’and will also contribute to the practical question of how much to spend on finding out.,9
1429,For reasons of economy the population of individuals approached is usually a small sample of the total relevant population.,9
1430,The size of the sample is less important than its structure.,9
1431,The first rule of sampling is that each member of the relevant population must have some chance of being included.,9
1432,If the  probability of being included is equal for each member of the relevant population then the sample is said to be a random one.,9
1433,Often the relevant population is stratified to ensure that the sample will be more representative in certain respects.,9
1434,"a survey of hospital staff would not usually be carried out by selecting names from the total staff list, it might concentrate on doctors, nurses or cleaners only, or might sample medical, paramedical, administrative and support staff in proportions of their total numbers the purpose of the survey.",9
1435,Sampling might also be carried out progressively involving different stages.,9
1436,"a survey concerned with the whole National Health Service staff might begin by separating the hospital and the general practice services, then sample key regions of the country, separate urban, suburban and rural services and then select within organisations as mentioned above.",9
1437,Sampling might also involve time phasing as in attempting to detect opinion trends leading a general election.,9
1438,It is possible to estimate sample sizes required if the tolerable error is known and (Yates 1960).,9
1439,Data may be obtained purely by observation but usually involve asking questions.,9
1440,The design of questionnaires is itself an art with certain ground rules.,9
1441,Clearly the questions must be such that the relevant population can be expected to understand them and to make informed responses.,9
1442,"The questions must avoid ambiguities which is not as easy as it might seem, it is desirable to obtain several opinions about the interpretation of each question from the same kind of people as those who will be in the survey.",9
1443,The sequence of questions may bias the answers e.g. a likely alternation of Yes/No answers is more ‘natural’ than a uniform series of Yes or No answers.,9
1444,The style of the question can also be unintentionally ‘loaded’ towards a particular response.,9
1445,There is a temptation to put in questions which will check against but this can irritate the responder who will easily detect redundancy.,9
1446,"There is also the temptation to make the questionnaire too long in the hope of getting just that little bit more information, this can more than defeat its object by reducing the response rate.",9
1447,"A new questionnaire should always be piloted, that is tried out on a small sample, before it is finalised.",9
1448,The main factor influencing response rate is whether the survey is postal or personal.,9
1449,The response rate to a verbal questionnaire can easily be 90% or more but a mailed questionnaire can have a response rate as low as 30% even with follow-up reminders.,9
1450,A low response rate is serious particularly if there is reason to suspect that persons likely to give particular kinds of answers might be less or more likely to respond than others.,9
1451,"Telephone based surveys are currently popular as a reasonable compromise, this increases the speed of data collection the insight which is revealed by personal interviews.",9
1452,Large scale impersonal surveys can be supplemented by more personally based interviews either with individuals or groups.,9
1453,The inference from samples may be deductive or inductive.,9
1454,Deductions can be made by statistical comparisons of samples to determine whether they are from different populations.,9
1455,Inferences from samples to populations can be made within quantitative confidence limits.,9
1456,Much of the labour which used to be involved in manipulating and presenting data can now be delegated to specialised computer software but the basic issues of coding and structuring data still depend on the skills of the analyst.,9
1457,The survey is the most extensively used method of obtaining generalisations about people.,9
1458,It can vary in precision from quantitative anthropometric surveys to attempts to describe the attributes of products which particular users prefer.,9
1459,The systematic survey is the antidote to excessive reliance on personal experience which is usually biased by exposure to idiosyncratic samples and by selective perception.,9
1460,The required systematic process is summarised in Table 2.3.,9
1461,Task training,9
1462,The distinction between task training and skill training is one of degree kind.,9
1463,In task training the objective is to guide the trainee into following rules and essentially to make the performance more automatic.,9
1464,"In skill training the opposite can apply, the trainee is persuaded to be flexible   and to orient himself towards the end the means.",9
1465,The difference between the two kinds of training is not as great as would appear at first sight because it turns out that task training has skill training an emphasis on the perceptual side of human functioning.,9
1466,Even in what appear to be straightforward motor skills the changes in learning are associated with greater selectivity and more economical use of the evidence needed to guide performance.,9
1467,These distinctions are summarised in Table 2.4.,9
1468,Task training is often called operator training or industrial training.,9
1469,The essential principles are:,9
1470,1.,9
1471,"The trainee must wish to learn, nothing can be achieved unless the trainee is adequately motivated.",9
1472,2.,9
1473,The learning must be steered by adequate knowledge of performance.,9
1474,The behavioural characteristic which facilitates both of these requirements is knowledge of results.,9
1475,This is the most potent and consistent performance shaping factor ever uncovered by psychologists.,9
1476,It simultaneously promotes motivation and performance.,9
1477,"Knowledge of how well one is doing will not provide the basic motivation the performer must care about his performance but if this is established, knowledge of performance is a most vigorous factor in developing and maintaining the will to perform.",9
1478,"Carmichael and Dearborn (1950) demonstrated that continuous reading was likely to result in increased failure of concentration within an hour, but if the performance of the reader was checked and confirmed by asking questions at half-hour intervals then performance could continue for six to eight hours without signs of fatigue.",9
1479,"Mackworth (1950), within his classical studies of vigilance, showed that without knowledge of results the proportion of detected signals decreased in succeeding half-hours compared with the first half-hour, but for subjects given knowledge of results there was no deterioration compared with the first half-hour through the full two hours of the study.",9
1480,Correspondingly the effectiveness of performance will improve with  knowledge of performance.,9
1481,This is as much a logical as a psychological principle.,9
1482,Clearly if a person has no knowledge of the success of performance the performance cannot improve because there can be no guidelines to steer the improvement.,9
1483,There have been many experiments demonstrating the validity of this principle and exploring detailed variables the timing and quality of feedback.,9
1484,"For details see Welford (1968), Bilodeau (1969), Annett (1969).",9
1485,Miller .,9
1486,(1960) formalise it into what they call the TOTE principle (Test Operate — Test — Exit).,9
1487,"The first test is a review of the situation, operate is the action which follows, the second test is a check the desired result has been achieved and this is followed either by another operation or by an exit if the desired result has been achieved.",9
1488,The TOTE is regarded as a fundamental unit of behaviour.,9
1489,"Broadly speaking the more immediate the feedback the more effective it is there comes a point at which, to use Miller's (1953) distinction, learning feedback becomes action feedback, the latter improves the current response whereas the former improves succeeding responses.",9
1490,"There is a risk that what is intended to be an aid only during training can become an undesirable crutch in that performance comes to depend on it but this is rare and can be avoided by using a suitable time delay, thus ensuring that it is really learning and not action feedback.",9
1491,The accuracy of the feedback need not be greater than the discrimination ability of the trainee but equally its value will diminish if it is too approximate.,9
1492,Feedback of the discrepancy between desirable and achieved performance is superior to feedback of absolute performance.,9
1493,"Holding (1965) distinguished between successive sub-classifications of feedback into intrinsic/artificial, concurrent/terminal, immediate/delayed, non-verbal/verbal, separate/accumulated.",9
1494,"The superior value of direct, rapid, unambiguous feedback dominates the choice of length and content of learning periods.",9
1495,There was an extended controversy between supporters of part and whole learning (Blum and Naylor 1968).,9
1496,The advantage of whole learning is that the connections between the parts are also learned simultaneously.,9
1497,However the advantage of part learning is that the feedback can be of much higher quality.,9
1498,"An excellent compromise is the progressive-part method (Seymour, 1966) in which parts are learned separately but combined in groups within a tree-like structure which converges on the total task.",9
1499,"See, , Singleton (1959), King (1964).",9
1500,The identification of the sub-tasks which are appropriate for intensive training with feedback is achieved by task analysis.,9
1501,"Unfortunately there is confusion in the literature and the required procedures may be referred to as either skills analysis or task analysis (Seymour 1968, Singer and Ramsden 1969, Miller 1962).",9
1502,In the terminology used in this book task analysis is the correct description of this activity.,9
1503,It will be evident from the dates of most of these references that this kind of training and the supporting research flourished in the 1960s.,9
1504,The need for it has reduced but has not vanished over the past twenty years.,9
1505,Technology has shifted the general allocation of function slightly both in industry and in defence.,9
1506,"Many processes have changed there is less direct human involvement in the production cycle, e.g. metal working, highly repetitive cycles can be conducted by robots and similar devices, e.g. in car assemblies, and the human operator gets better support still involved directly, e.g. the word processor as a substitute for the typewriter.",9
1507,Nevertheless within most jobs there are some tasks which are amenable to this kind of training and the benefits are considerable.,9
1508,"If task training is neglected the larger job may be interfered with, e.g. the manager attempting to use a personal computer with inadequate key-board and data search performance.",9
1509,Key-board manipulation is a skill relevant to many tasks and is typical of psycho-motor skills the perceptual elements of identify and select dominate the motor element of actual key pressing.,9
1510,As mentioned earlier improvements in speed and accuracy result from changes in the control of performance.,9
1511,Skill training,9
1512,The simplest criterion for the distinction between a skill and a task is that a skill description is susceptible to individual differences but a task description is not.,9
1513,Skill implies idiosyncratic performance and as such can transfer between many tasks whereas a task meets a particular requirement within a system activity.,9
1514,Thus it follows that skill training is more generalised and generalisable and is better fitted to the overall role of human operators.,9
1515,Education is the ultimate form of skill training where no attempt is made to specify the particular purposes for which the skills might be utilised.,9
1516,This limits the potential rigour of design because the anchor of skill training is the specification of the objectives.,9
1517,"Incidentally this accounts for the interminable debate about education, since objectives are not specifiable the content can only emerge as a consensus within the current .",9
1518,Skill descriptions are generalisable in that human operators have characteristic abilities and limitations and therefore have tendencies to perform in the same way.,9
1519,Differences in level of skill are partly but not wholly attributable to different locations on a learning curve which has some uniformity for that particular skill.,9
1520,"Skills cannot be transferred directly from a trainer to a trainee, the function of the trainer is to provide conditions and guidelines which will facilitate learning.",9
1521,"To do this the trainer must have a coherent model of the form of the   skill, this is attained by skills analysis.",9
1522,Inevitably skills analysis is more general and less definitive than task analysis although many of the same procedures for extracting evidence might be used.,9
1523,"Skills analysis may also involve experiments to study more closely how the required objective is achieved (Drury and Fox, 1975, Singleton, 1978).",9
1524,It requires a broader approach than task analysis in that it often involves tracing the acquisition of the skill starting from the kind of persons who undertake training (the selection criteria) through the training procedures to the end product (the training success criteria).,9
1525,Such training often has an emphasis on features style and quality mere speed of activity.,9
1526,This can extend beyond skill training to attitude training (see below).,9
1527,These differences are summarised in Table 2.5.,9
1528,"There is emphasis on the end purpose or objective with relatively less attention to the means, partly to allow for individual differences and partly because the evidence accumulating in particular cases may change the direction of progress.",9
1529,For this reason skill training is sometimes called strategic training.,9
1530,Such activities are found in the broad range of tasks concerned with diagnosis.,9
1531,"These can vary from dealing with faults in equipment (Tilley, 1967) to dealing with patients in a surgery or clinic (Rutter, 1979).",9
1532,In all cases although the reason for the activity is clear cut the means of achieving the desired end vary widely the path taken and the time required.,9
1533,"The medical interview has much counselling (Joanning .,",9
1534,"1979) and occupational guidance (Davis and Shackleton, 1975).",9
1535,"Medical diagnosis involves social skills (Melhuish, 1979) but as discussed earlier the basis and development of these skills is not dissimilar from other  cognitive skills and correspondingly the training can follow the same principles (Singleton .,",9
1536,"1980; Argyle, 1981).",9
1537,Attitude training,9
1538,Attitudes are much more difficult to change than are skills and there can be ambiguity about what constitutes an improvement.,9
1539,"Attitudes involve values which vary between individuals, societies and cultures.",9
1540,"‘brain washing’ is a form of attitude training which attempts to change the beliefs and values acquired within a particular culture (Biderman, 1967).",9
1541,"The extreme techniques of isolation, starvation and other forms of stress induction give some indication of the pressures required to positively change attitudes.",9
1542,Generation of standard useful attitudes has always been one of the main purposes of military training.,9
1543,"The objective is to cultivate the willingness to accept or ignore personal risk (Page, 1987).",9
1544,In the civilian context the purposes of attitude training are to do with care about quality and safety.,9
1545,Apprenticeship training is essentially about ensuring standards of workmanship and characteristically it appears at first sight to take an unconscionably long time.,9
1546,A common fallacy is the attempt to assess apprenticeship schemes task and skill training.,9
1547,Safety training is also about attitudes and such schemes rarely have the hoped for success because the difficulty and time required are invariably underestimated.,9
1548,"This is also the reason why road accidents are so difficult to approach by training, safety on the road is much more to do with attitudes than with driving skill (Parry, 1968).",9
1549,"In summary, we have no useful theory about the design of attitude training and success in practice is based on indirect traditional procedures.",9
1550,Skills analysis,9
1551,It will be appreciated from the earlier sections of this chapter that skills analysis is not reducible to simple procedures or recipes.,9
1552,In principle it is impossible because skills are by their nature totally integrated and interactive they cannot meaningfully be separated into independent parts.,9
1553,"Nevertheless, as in many other situations the analyst, himself a skilled performer, has some success in practice.",9
1554,A skill description relates to how a task is performed and what is achieved what actions are taken.,9
1555,The reference is to the end and the means is described in person terms task terms.,9
1556,This is because the end is more consistent than the means.,9
1557,Although there may be considerable  in the actions the situation is not anarchical.,9
1558,The human operator  has characteristic ways of doing things and detection of these is one aspect of the skill of the skills analyst.,9
1559,There are differences in skills analysis procedure the kind of skill.,9
1560,For the skills of interacting with the physical world the procedure summarised in Table 2.6 is appropriate.,9
1561,This involves observation of the skill in practice and during training and discussion with practitioners and trainers.,9
1562,There are useful ways of focusing such observation by contrasting good/poor performers and experienced/inexperienced performers.,9
1563,Discussion with practitioners can be focused by asking them to talk while performing and by jointly discussing performances observed on film or tape.,9
1564,For management skills there is greater emphasis on the objectives and how they are arrived at.,9
1565,Objectives in an organisational context are many constraints.,9
1566,"Some financial resources are easily specifiable, others not contravening the mores of the organisation are more elusive but a key aspect of these skills is sensitivity to limitations and obstacles positive assets (Singleton, 1981).",9
1567,The variety of management tasks is often so great as to warrant a task analysis with separate skills analyses of particular tasks or groups of tasks.,9
1568,At this level the practitioner is often the conscious monitor of the practice and facility in self-monitoring is a useful indicator of skill.,9
1569,Social skills can involve not only self-monitoring but also monitoring of what another person is thinking doing.,9
1570,", analysing a transaction between two skilled negotiators requires the study of the overt interaction and the identification of what each one is thinking about what he himself is doing and what his opponent is probably thinking about in the context of what he is saying (Singleton, 1983a).",9
1571,There are no standard formats for skill descriptions but usually they can be separated into two parts: the performance and the antecedents to the performance.,9
1572,"That is respectively the key aspects of behaviour which contribute to success and the kind of education, training and experience normally required.",9
1573,At high levels of idiosyncratic skill (flair see p. 245) analysis is particularly difficult because the practitioner may have little conscious awareness of how or why he achieves unusual success.,9
1574,In fact it almost seems to be a condition of such performance that the exponent must not proceed logically but must temporarily inhibit his conscious critical faculties and accept control by intuition.,9
1575,"This has been graphically described as ‘switching on the autopilot’(Drasdo, 1979).",9
1576,"The commonsense view that to proceed with care is to proceed slowly can also be reversed in high level skills, there are instances where speed seems to be an essential accompaniment of delicate discrimination (Lacy, 1978).",9
1577,"Thus, the observer cannot simplify his task by asking the practitioner to go more slowly nor can he rely on the introspection of the skilled performer.",9
1578,Skill is demonstrated by persistent and efficient pursuit of an objective and   the skill can usually be understood although not necessarily written down with any great precision a goal and the path towards that goal.,9
1579,The path is generated by navigating through a conceptual map containing landmarks and decision points (key features of the skill) and by the avoidance of obstacles and misleading features which have been sensitively detected.,9
1580,Applications,9
1581,Selection and guidance,9
1582,These processes are variations on the general theme of matching a worker to an appropriate job.,9
1583,"In the case of selection the given point is the job and the population is searched to find the most appropriate worker, in the case of guidance one worker is the starting point and the range of jobs is searched to identify the best one.",9
1584,The two complementary processes are shown in Fig. 2. 1.,9
1585,They can usefully be considered together because they are similar and interactive.,9
1586,"Thus, in the selection situation the process involves not only analysing and describing the job but also considering the availability of potentially appropriate workers.",9
1587,In the guidance situation the process involves analysing and describing the worker and consideration of the availability of suitable jobs.,9
1588,"At the point of a successful match the worker is described the  kinds of job he could do and the job is described the kind of worker needed to do it, Table 2.7.",9
1589,For most people and jobs the whole process takes place within a localised community.,9
1590,"For the highest level jobs a whole country or even an international community might be considered, but in European countries most workers attempt to find jobs which do not require either moving house or excessive travelling, and such proximity has corresponding advantages for the potential employers.",9
1591,"Thus, the selection process involves   describing the job first by analysis (task and skills analysis) and then the translation of these data into worker relevant terminology.",9
1592,Consideration of the potential worker availability may lead to a redesign of the job either by the use of a different task combination or by introducing different technology.,9
1593,It is then necessary to communicate with the market by publicising the available job usually by advertising.,9
1594,"This is itself an important stage in the process because a well prepared advertisement will enable the recipients to engage in self selection which does not, at this stage, involve further selector resources.",9
1595,To this end it is useful to have a multi-stage process as shown in Fig. 2.2.,9
1596,"Having developed some interest on the basis of a necessarily brief advertisement a potential candidate can apply for further written details which should contain a comprehensive description of the job, the task and skill content, the responsibilities, the salary and the details of the organisation including its history and anticipated future, and an application form.",9
1597,A name with job title and telephone number should be included informal interaction and discussion of details of particular interest to the candidate can take place before the commitment to transmission of the application form.,9
1598,All this can be done at minimal cost.,9
1599,If the job description has been properly constructed there should not be an excessive number of applicants the next stage of a paper sift is also economical.,9
1600,There then follow the more expensive stages of final selection which may involve testing and interviewing as described earlier.,9
1601,The choice of the interviewers and the interview process depends on the particular job.,9
1602,"At one extreme it may be one company representative, at the other extreme there may  be a series of interview boards.",9
1603,The interview board can have covert purposes where the senior person who is the chairman of the board will use the opportunity to orientate the precise expectations from the post to be filled including settling differences of opinion between his subordinates who are also members of the board.,9
1604,Ideally this should be done before candidates are interviewed but it can happen that differences in preferences for candidates reveal different opinions between board members which the chairman can detect and deal with.,9
1605,Guidance also involves testing and interviewing but this is invariably a two person situation of a counsellor and client.,9
1606,"The problem is that most clients have only the vaguest, undefined ideas about the most suitable choice and direction of career.",9
1607,The counsellor can help by identifying the client's job-relevant characteristics and by contributing his knowledge about occupations (Fig. 2.3.).,9
1608,The former may be supported by testing although test results are essentially evidence to enable the individual to clarify his own self concept.,9
1609,"The latter may start from national classifications of occupations the   American Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) and the British Classification of Occupations and Dictionary of Occupational Titles (CODOT), but the counsellor's suggestions are likely to converge very rapidly into a more comprehensible repertoire of possibilities using evidence about the particular client (Singleton, 1975).",9
1610,This process can be supported by a computer with which the client may interact alone or it may be used by the counsellor as a database and prompter.,9
1611,A guidance episode necessarily takes place at one point in time within the developing skills and experience of the client.,9
1612,"To emphasise the continuous nature of career development and the changing aspirations of people at different ages Super has proposed a division into five stages: Growth (0–14 years); Exploration (15–24 years); Establishment (25–44); Maintenance (45–64 years); and Decline (65 onwards)(Super and Bohn, 1971).",9
1613,Placement,9
1614,"Placement is a mixture of selection and guidance, a process of mutual matching takes place within a known range of persons and jobs.",9
1615,The problem arises when a batch of recruits enter military service or when a large company takes on a new set of graduates.,9
1616,It is one application of psychometrics to man-power planning (see previous chapter).,9
1617,It becomes of particular significance within the currently fashionable company policy of separating core and peripheral employees.,9
1618,Given the vagaries of the market and rapid changes in processes and products stimulated by changing technology the strategy has evolved of taking on many employees for a short term only.,9
1619,These may be production workers but they may also be senior people; managers hired for a fixed term and technologists and others used as consultants.,9
1620,The placement task is to describe the requirements and the appropriate sources of individuals with the relevant skills (Fig. 2.1).,9
1621,For the core workers who are permanent staff again there may well be a mixture of people at all levels and here there is more emphasis on career progression and job satisfaction.,9
1622,Core employees are given written annual assessments which can be discussed with the immediate senior who is probably the writer of the assessment.,9
1623,For this purpose he is provided with a well-structured form by the personnel department who will also advise on the timely use of in-house or external courses to extend the range of skills of a particular employee.,9
1624,By contrast the peripheral employee is judged entirely on his past record or that of the consultant company which employs him on a semi-permanent basis.,9
1625,He is hired to undertake a specific task without reference to longer term features job satisfaction or career development.,9
1626,The peripheral employee will be compensated for his disadvantages by a much greater pay rate per hour and the company gains by reduced overheads and greater work-force flexibility.,9
1627,The whole strategy works very well for younger workers with well documented training and experience.,9
1628,"This reinforces the view, developed in the previous chapter, that manufacturing industry is following the Armed Forces in relying more and more on fit, skilled, mobile workers.",9
1629,Psychometrically the problem is to develop appropriate descriptive taxonomies a person's actual or potential contribution to an organisation is succinctly expressible.,9
1630,"These remain primitive in that, on the whole, non-technical English is used with all the possibilities of ambiguity and communication at cross purposes which this implies.",9
1631,The accountants are the psychologists in developing ideas profit centres applicable to small groups or even to individuals.,9
1632,"The increased awareness of the importance of the individual worker to profit and success generally, particularly at higher levels in the organisation, has stimulated the growth of a specialist placement profession colloquially known as the head hunters.",9
1633,These are companies which specialise in assisting a client in clarifying what kind of person they need and how to locate him within the potentially suitable worker population.,9
1634,They may also start with an individual and search for a location.,9
1635,"This also is done mainly by interview although some use is made of psychometric tests, profiles and rating scales.",9
1636,The design of training schemes,9
1637,Designing and conducting training schemes is expensive and is not undertaken without good reasons.,9
1638,Among possible reasons are:,9
1639,1.,9
1640,An inadequate reservoir of competent workers for particular tasks,9
1641,2.,9
1642,"A workforce sufficient in numbers or supply but not in skill level as evidenced usually by quality of work and less frequently by failures to meet production targets, danger to people and damage to equipment",9
1643,3.,9
1644,Changes in technology which result in changes in required skills,9
1645,4.,9
1646,An organisational commitment to continuous improvement of the skills of members,9
1647,5.,9
1648,To meet statutory requirements in certain dangerous industries and services,9
1649,6.,9
1650,As a service to customers buying equipment,9
1651,7.,9
1652,As a service to the community paid for by public funds,9
1653,The remit of the training scheme and those responsible for it may end at the transition point to operational activity or may continue in those periods of work regarded as a continuation of training and supervised as such.,9
1654,In either case there needs to be close liaison between those responsible for training and those responsible for operations.,9
1655,On the other hand training is always vulnerable because the benefits are  long-term and it often needs protection from the demands of management and operations where there are other priorities.,9
1656,"The simplest protective barrier is a geographical one, namely to conduct the training other centres of activity within the organisation.",9
1657,"Sometimes a separate room is sufficient, in other situations a different part of the country may be chosen to provide adequate isolation.",9
1658,The essential vulnerability reinforces the requirement that the starting point of design should be a clarification of objectives followed by a consideration of the criteria of assessment that the objectives have been achieved.,9
1659,"None of this need be numerical, sometimes numbers are used to provide a pseudo precision which can be counterproductive because the validity of the numbers can so easily be questioned.",9
1660,Precise verbal statements and descriptions avoid this pitfall.,9
1661,The sensitivity of training regimes to external pressures is demonstrated by the erratic interest and activity in this area observable at the national level.,9
1662,"Inevitably there was a burst of activity during and immediately after World War II as shown by military research and development (Wolfie, 1951) and by the ‘Training within Industry’(TWI) movement (War Man-power Commission, 1945).",9
1663,"Although research continued the next burst of application in the U.K. took place following the Industrial Training Act of 1964 (Robinson and Barnes, 1968, Barber 1968).",9
1664,"The Act concentrated on training oriented by industry, the other possibilities considered were occupations and geographical regions.",9
1665,It resulted in the creation of a Central Training Council and a comprehensive range of Industrial Training Boards.,9
1666,Each Board was financed by a levy on the relevant industry.,9
1667,"Not surprisingly this created a demand for experienced trainer manpower which could not be met, there was some disillusion and retrenchment in the 1970s.",9
1668,In the 1980s there has been another resurgence of activity following the realisation that the country is simultaneously suffering from a high rate of unemployment and a shortage of workers with specific skills.,9
1669,"Extensive government resources are channelled by the Department of Employment through the Training Commission into the Youth Training Schemes, job training, skill training .",9
1670,The objectives and criteria of success of any training scheme are best described in system terms.,9
1671,The next step is to translate these into a person oriented description of what the successful scheme graduate will have acquired.,9
1672,"This is more than skills because the total expertise will include also rules, knowledge and contextual information.",9
1673,This last will vary from some acquaintance with the parent company to the basic technology behind the tasks.,9
1674,Together these make up the content or syllabus of the course.,9
1675,"Decisions are then needed on how to train, which will include whether or which parts should be on-line or off-line, whether the operator is required to   function in a mainly programmed (i.e. rule-following) mode and how far he may need to function in a conceptual (i.e. actions based on understanding) mode.",9
1676,"Consideration will be given to the use of training aids technical notes, schematic diagrams, video tapes, closed circuit television and simulators.",9
1677,"The most important training aids are the instructors, the selection and training of these is a vital secondary scheme supporting the primary scheme.",9
1678,These many facets of training scheme design are shown in Table 2.8.,9
1679,Programmed instruction,9
1680,The origins of this movement are in the teaching machines first developed systematically about 1960.,9
1681,These consisted of film strips with associated projection devices and control panels which enabled the student to examine a particular screen presentation and respond by moving to another frame.,9
1682,The succeeding frame might take up another topic or might contain answers and comments on questions posed on the previous one.,9
1683,There was some scope for interaction the series of presentations was determined by  the student's choice of responses.,9
1684,If the student demonstrated by his choices that he did not fully understand a particular point then the programme could send him round an additional explanatory loop.,9
1685,This was called a branching programme as distinct from a linear programme which contained no loops.,9
1686,It will be appreciated that this technique of automated teaching seemed to have enormous potential.,9
1687,Classroom teaching is inherently skilled man-power intensive.,9
1688,There are obvious benefits in allowing each student to go at his own pace.,9
1689,It is not surprising that teaching machines had considerable appeal to the military and to large scale industry.,9
1690,"Some years of intensive research and development resulted in a more realistic view (Glaser, 1965; Wallis .,",9
1691,"1966, Kay .,",9
1692,1968).,9
1693,It became clear that the quality of the programme was the key to degree of success.,9
1694,"The machine itself and its style of operation was incidental, in fact it was possible to achieve the same procedure if not quite the same discipline on the student by using programmed books with directional references to other pages at the end of each page.",9
1695,If a well-structured book is the answer then we have gone full-circle and back to the benefits of a systematic text-book.,9
1696,"In research terms the study of programmed instruction was instrumental in encouraging a more systems view of the teaching/training process with associated trends towards greater consideration of objectives, task analysis, cost/ benefits .",9
1697,Correspondingly from a practical training viewpoint there developed a more systematic approach to taxonomies of training and of instructional methods together with their inter-relationships.,9
1698,Tables 2.9 and 2.10 are examples from an overview of military training.,9
1699,"Regarded in systems terms, programmed instruction cannot be an isolated continuously developing activity because it depends on the skills of the programme writer and these skills can only be developed on the basis of experience in the classroom.",9
1700,On the other hand teaching machines are one way of utilising the skilled teacher on a larger scale than his personal activity in the classroom.,9
1701,There is a different form of automatic teaching device called a pacing machine which can facilitate the development of motor skills.,9
1702,It consists of a machine which emits bleeps at timed intervals.,9
1703,The intervals are predetermined by the elements of a motor task or more simply by the target cycle time of a task.,9
1704,The trainee performs his task and tries to keep in phase with the bleeps which are intended to pace his performance.,9
1705,The required rate of work can be increased by shortening the time intervals.,9
1706,The second main phase of programmed instruction became feasible with the development of low cost computing.,9
1707,Computer aided instruction (C.A.I.) strictly should cover other techniques simulation and computer based procedures but it is usually intended to mean a situation where a student sits   a screen on which the presented formats relate to his developing cognitive activity as expressed by his manipulations of the associated key-board.,9
1708,Even with this restricted interface there is enormous flexibility and the training tasks can vary from reading and simple arithmetic to diagnosing faults in the complex plant used in process industries.,9
1709,The use of computer aided instruction in primary schools has created a new  generation of what have been called ‘television children’.,9
1710,They regard the screen/keyboard interface as no more unnatural than a book is to earlier generations.,9
1711,This has far reaching consequences at the cultural level not only for learning but also for the design of jobs and even for leisure pursuits which increasingly depend on the same kind of interface.,9
1712,Many of the earlier forms of computer aided instructions used a central computer facility and a set of work-stations where a whole class of trainees could function simultaneously.,9
1713,The development of micro-computers resulted in the use of more isolated dedicated systems for just one trainee.,9
1714,In either case it is feasible to collect data about a trainee's performance and modify the presented information accordingly.,9
1715,It is also possible to collect learning data and feed it to an instructor either on-line or off-line.,9
1716,The widespread use of computer based learning and testing situations has stimulated the development of ‘student modelling’.,9
1717,All the data about one student is collected into one bank which changes dynamically with his learning achievements (and failures).,9
1718,In this way a student model containing a profile of attainment together with a history of progress to date can be made available to the trainer and to the trainee.,9
1719,"However, communication links between the trainee and the trainer via a computer are not a substitute for the two-way conversation and observation which normally takes place in a class-room.",9
1720,Computer programmes are notoriously literal in their requirement for and response to operator responses.,9
1721,Trainee-computer communication failures for very simple reasons can lead to a complete hiatus unless they are detected and restored by an experienced trainer who can explain to the trainee why the system is failing to respond adequately.,9
1722,The third phase of programmed instruction called Tutorial Expert Systems (TES) involves artificial intelligence (see p. 234).,9
1723,To a trainee at the interface this may not seem very different from a teaching machine or computer aided instruction but the logic or architecture of the driving system is different even more flexibility is available.,9
1724,responding directly by logical rules and paths which have been envisaged and stored by the programmer an expert system training programme contains a knowledge base and an inference engine which can consult the knowledge base and respond more adaptively to the idiosyncratic needs of the trainee.,9
1725,"It can also explain why it is proposing a certain strategy and why the detected strategy of the trainee is appropriate or not, and, if not, why not.",9
1726,"From the user's point of view these systems are usually menu driven, that is the operator can select his path of consultation by choices within ranges of possible choices which are presented to him.",9
1727,Technically the task of the programme designer is made easier by the use of training skills and declarative programming languages.,9
1728,A training shell is a generalised  tutorial system which can operate with a variety of knowledge bases.,9
1729,A declarative programming language is one which can accept statements of relationships or rules for relationships contrasting with more traditional languages which encompass only step by step logic.,9
1730,It will be appreciated that this rapidly developing field of expertise contains extensive new jargon.,9
1731,At this stage the jargon is an obstacle in that anyone wishing to find out about the field has first to interpret the jargon.,9
1732,This is doubly difficult there is much overlap in terminology and concepts and specialists are not consistent with in the use of these new terms.,9
1733,"the field will eventually clarify and mature and the terminology will be designed with precision meaningful concepts, tools and methods are unambiguously clarified and distinguished but this has not yet happened.",9
1734,From a behavioural standpoint the issues are the same as in any other field where technology is simultaneously providing many new facilities for supporting and measuring human performance.,9
1735,1.,9
1736,Technology provides trainer aids not trainer substitutes.,9
1737,Thus computer assisted instruction (CAI) is more aptly descriptive than computer based training (CBT).,9
1738,2.,9
1739,"Technology enforces rigorous thinking to the point of revealing embarrassing gaps in learning, teaching and training theory.",9
1740,On the other hand technology also opens up new possibilities for monitoring and measurement which should support the development of better basic theory.,9
1741,3.,9
1742,It is essential to develop the basic taxonomies behind the learning situation.,9
1743,any diagnostic task can be aided by a taxonomy of symptoms and a taxonomy of causes together with connections between them.,9
1744,4.,9
1745,The need for interdisciplinary approaches is reinforced but the abiding difficulties of interdisciplinary communications remain at every level from different values and concepts to different terminologies.,9
1746,Communication between information technologists and behavioural specialists is a continuous struggle which can eventually be rewarding.,9
1747,5.,9
1748,The design of the man-machine interface (MMI) or the human-computer interface (HCI) or more simply human interfaces (HI) remains one of the most difficult design problems but a crucial one in that poorly designed interfaces will wreck the performance of any system.,9
1749,6.,9
1750,Evaluation is an essential procedure within the implementation of any new system.,9
1751,for training systems this can be very expensive the requirements to monitor the learning process and compare procedures which are anyway never completely comparable.,9
1752,Apparently extraneous variables trainee motivation and trainer expertise continue to dominate other factors differences in technology and differences in learning tasks.,9
1753,7.,9
1754,Pedagogically the need to be much clearer about what is being taught and why is a mixed blessing.,9
1755,The formal discipline can sometimes tidy up muddled thinking but at other times it can interfere with the creatively developing interaction between trainer and trainee.,9
1756,", programmed instruction is most useful for tasks which can be comprehensively specified.",9
1757,"This implies tasks based on rules arithmetic, or on logic, fault finding.",9
1758,The use of simulators,9
1759,"When serious consequences can follow from human errors, e.g. in flying an aircraft, or when on-line operation is too expensive to be trusted to the hands of trainees, e.g. in process control, there is obviously a case for providing training devices which simulate the performance of on-line systems.",9
1760,"In this way risks and costs are reduced, the performance of trainees is more easily measured and the presented situation is precisely controlled by the trainers.",9
1761,It is feasible to provide adequate exposure to events which in practice might be rare but very serious.,9
1762,High fidelity simulation is an interesting challenge to technological design.,9
1763,Simulators can provide demonstrations which always impress visitors.,9
1764,With all these advantages it is not surprising that a great deal of effort and resources go into the provision of simulators for high technology industry.,9
1765,Paradoxically the more advanced the technology the easier it is to provide good simulation.,9
1766,", a process control plant which consists of dials, charts and visual display units responding to activation of switches is much easier to simulate than, say, an opponent in a game of tennis.",9
1767,"The perfect simulation which has been suggested but not yet implemented in process control, power generation and air traffic control would be to have two identical control rooms and two crews coming on duty.",9
1768,One crew would control a real system and the other would think they were so doing but would in fact be in a control room driven by software.,9
1769,"This seems to be the only way of avoiding the main snag of simulation, namely that the trainee is aware that his performance is not important in that reality out there is not changing as a consequence of his actions.",9
1770,"However, he will always know that his performance on a simulator is being assessed and, the business of risks, he may well take more care than he would in a real plant.",9
1771,In many if not most industries where simulators are used the benefits to training are not confined to dynamic system control and fault diagnosis.,9
1772,The control function is exercised by a team and the efficient interaction between the team members is also improvement with practice (see p. 95).,9
1773,Transfer of training from a simulator to a real situation is never complete and does not necessarily increase with degree of fidelity.,9
1774,Simple simulations can be as effective for training purposes as more elaborate ones and can certainly be more cost effective.,9
1775,Degree of transfer is not easy to measure and needs to be carefully defined.,9
1776,", in training manually guided missile operators the degree of transfer is appropriately measured by ‘first shot’ success whereas in training and retraining flight deck crew the long term contribution to safety is the appropriate measure.",9
1777,Gagne (1962) provides an excellent review of earlier work in this field.,9
1778,More recent experience is reviewed in Stammers (1983).,9
1779,For details of experimental studies using large scale defence simulations see Parsons (1972).,9
1780,"Moraal and Kraiss (1981) contains chapters dealing with simulations of a ship entering harbour, car driving, tank driving, the flight deck and air traffic control.",9
1781,MSC (1986) reviews the current use of simulators in twenty U.K. industries.,9
1782,As a research tool the simulator provides a happy medium between the precision of laboratory studies and the realism of field studies.,9
1783,It is not widely used for research outside the military the cost of high fidelity simulator time.,9
1784,A complex dedicated simulator can cost several million pounds and it needs its own crew of skilled operators.,9
1785,On the other hand standard micro-computers have considerable potentiality for quite elaborate simulation and effective simulation training on procedures may only require simple static mock-ups.,9
1786,Simulator development has been driven by technology by the behavioural sciences with the standard result that there is a high reliance on face validity with relatively little resource devoted to systematic evaluation.,9
1787,Key features the timing and extent of simulator usage are based on experience in particular industries on more formal evidence.,9
1788,The ergonomics approach to their use is shown in Fig. 2.4 but it must be admitted that this is rarely followed in practice.,9
1789,Simulation should be regarded as one tool within the repertoire of the training specialist.,9
1790,There are other uses of simulators.,9
1791,They can be used for assessment independently of training.,9
1792,Data collected during simulator trials is a useful source of risk and reliability data.,9
1793,"In the nuclear power plant design they are also used as the final stage of pre-construction design evaluation (Williams and Story, 1987).",9
1794,They can also be used as a resource for checking operating instructions and for conducting detailed task analyses.,9
1795,For these purposes the simulator must be available before the main control room is constructed.,9
1796,The full range of potential simulator usage is summarised in Table 2.11.,9
1,The School Framework,10
2,A Model to Link Personality Characteristics to a Preference for Science,10
3,John Head,10
4,Introduction,10
5,In recent years there has been a steady accumulation of evidence that personality and allied affective factors play a crucial role in determining subject choice and student success.,10
6,"Unfortunately, this evidence has tended to be fragmentary, a collection of separate, discrete pieces of information lacking a synthesizing theory to provide cohesion and predictive power.",10
7,The few models which have been developed to date may have been correct as far as they go but are clearly incomplete.,10
8,"Roe (1952), Eiduson (1962) and McClelland (1962) suggested that male scientists often experienced a lonely childhood, perhaps suffering social isolation through illness or family circumstances, they developed a strong interest in their surrounding material world and a below average interest in other people and relationships.",10
9,Maslow (1966) and Hudson (1966 and 1968) saw science as providing an emotionally undemanding activity appealing to boys moving from the calm of latency to the turbulence of adolescence.,10
10,"these descriptions are valid they still leave open a number of questions, particularly why the same mechanisms do not operate with girls.",10
11,Arising from the evidence in the literature and from our empirical studies at Chelsea College it is now possible to offer a model which is compatible with all the evidence and which also has considerable predictive potential.,10
12,What we know about persons choosing science,10
13,The evidence for an association between personality characteristics and an interest in science has been more fully reviewed by Head (1979).,10
14,We need now only take note of the most salient features.,10
15,The most obvious one is that of sex differences.,10
16,"The predominance of males, particularly in the physical sciences and engineering, throughout the Western world can be satisfactorily attributed to cognitive differences, which are too small, nor to institutional factors.",10
17,Equal opportunity in education and employment has not made science any more popular with women.,10
18,"Furthermore, the characteristics of those students who do opt for science show clear sex differences.",10
19,"Male scientists, both science students and mature, professional scientists, tend to be emotionally reticent, disliking overt emotional expression in others and themselves, and depending upon their partners in personal relationships to take the emotional initiatives.",10
20,"They will also tend to be authoritarian, conservative and controlled in their thinking.",10
21,These differences can be seen quite early on; we have found boys aged 14 years who were opting for science to be significantly more authoritarian than their peers.,10
22,"Girls choosing science are not particularly emotionally reticent or rigid in their thinking, although they do seem to have low self-esteem being socially and sexually attractive.",10
23,We also know that at about the age of 13 a very high proportion of boys are attracted to science and scientific careers.,10
24,"Thereafter, there is a steady decline of interest in science and this disillusionment extends right through the secondary-school years and into the undergraduate period.",10
25,"In contrast, only a minority of girls express an interest in science at any age but there is no obvious swing from science in the middle and late teens.",10
26,Some further evidence has come from our use of sentence completion tests with secondary-school pupils as part of our research programme at Chelsea.,10
27,Analysis of these responses provides further information on sex differences and between those opting for different subjects.,10
28,", girls at the age of 12 and 14 years seem to take a more mature attitude to personal relationships, seeing their complexity and reciprocal nature, while boys are more exploitative.",10
29,"the sentence stem ‘A girl and her mother…’, girls often produce responses like ‘often go through a bad patch for a year but once they learn to understand , become the best of friends’ or ‘can help with their problems’.",10
30,"Similar questions, when asked of boys, tend to produce banal responses or exploitative ones, the parent is seen as the source of money.",10
31,"In contrast, boys seem to have a firmer self-identity and a clearer ambition showing more insight sentence stems ‘My main problem is…’ and ‘He/she felt proud that…’.",10
32,Such findings give us some clues about the characteristics of boys and girls of these ages.,10
33,"If we compare boys of 14 years of age who opt for science with other boys, we find that the former have very cut-and-dried views on many issues.",10
34,", they take the view that ‘criminals should be severely punished’ or that ‘anyone who is unpopular deserves his fate’.",10
35,"To the sentence stem ‘When a child will not join in group activities…’, these boys gave responses like ‘he is selfish’, ‘he must be stupid’, ‘he deserves to be unpopular’.",10
36,"In contrast, other boys and most girls pondered the possible causes and ways of integrating the child into the group.",10
37,"The science boys seemed to possess few doubts or uncertainties, they offered clear-cut answers.",10
38,It was this evidence which suggested the possible model for subject choice ego-identity achievement.,10
39,Ego-identity in adolescence,10
40,This model was originally postulated by Erikson (1965) and then developed by Marcia (1966 and 1976).,10
41,Erikson suggests that at different phases of life an individual faces a particular psycho-social problem which needs to be resolved before moving on to the next phase.,10
42,For adolescents the acquisition of a clear ego-identity is the crucial task.,10
43,"At the beginning of adolescence, the individual is a  within the family and the school.",10
44,"By the end of adolescence he [or she]needs to make choices about career, life-style, personal relationships and ideologies.",10
45,The ego-identity of that person is shaped by these choices.,10
46,Erikson does not suggest that the development of an ego-identity is a once-and-for-all issue.,10
47,"Some problems about identity arise with the young child in the context of home and school, and others occur in later life, on retirement.",10
48,"Nevertheless, adolescence is the time when ego-identity development inevitably dominates the personal development of the individual for a while.",10
49,"The adolescent does not, however, need to achieve a clear ego-identity on all topics at one time.",10
50,He [or she]may have a clear identity in respect to his [or her]career but still be unresolved personal relationships and ideology.,10
51,In this article we are concerned with ego-identity achievement in respect to career.,10
52,"Marcia has put more detail onto the Erikson model and suggests that in going from the initial ego-diffusion condition to that of having achieved ego-identity, two processes are involved:and .",10
53,Crisis in this context describes a period of intensive self-examination in which one's beliefs and values are re-examined.,10
54,Commitment means that the individual has acquired clear and firm beliefs both about himself [or herself]and the world.,10
55,Figure 16.1 indicates a number of possible routes to ego-identity achievements.,10
56,"A person may undergo crisis and commitment simultaneously and progress by route A. An alternative is to undergo a period of considerable self-doubt and self-examination in which all one's beliefs tend to be very fluid, a period known as moratorium, before acquiring beliefs for oneself and ego-identity is achieved (route B).",10
57,"A further possibility is that the individual may, for a time, hold onto beliefs and values taken without question from others, parents, teachers, peers.",10
58,This condition is known as   foreclosure.,10
59,"Eventually these persons might have to face a period of crisis, of self-examination, and so achieve ego-identity by route C. However, foreclosure does offer an escape route and an individual might postpone indefinitely any real self-examination by clinging rigidly to his [or her]beliefs and values (route D).",10
60,Ego-identity and Choosing Science,10
61,We can now make the link between this model of adolescent development and subject choice in schools.,10
62,"For boys at the foreclosure stage, science is likely to be appealing.",10
63,"The physical sciences , offer a conventional career choice which is likely to win approval from parents, teachers and peers.",10
64,"They will tend to regard the overt expression of emotions, including much such expression in the arts, as being soft and feminine.",10
65,"Science, with its masculine image, makes little emotional demand on an individual and seems to offer clear, precise answers to problems.",10
66,Opting for science will permit and possibly reinforce emotional reticence.,10
67,For a girl at the foreclosure stage the situation is very different.,10
68,"There is evidence that girls tend to be socialized into adult roles more through their potential of becoming a mother and housewife than through their career (Douvan and Adelson, 1966).",10
69,"Furthermore, these girls will tend to go into a career with a feminine image, one which already attracts many girls.",10
70,"Consequently, very few girls at the foreclosure stage will enter science unless they receive considerable encouragement and a model to do so from their parents and their school.",10
71,Neither boys nor girls at the moratorium stage are likely to be attracted to the science that is usually presented in our schools.,10
72,"They are at a stage when they are likely to be concerned with a variety of complex issues; the meaning of life, the existence of God, ideologies, their emerging sexuality, their future career and life-style — too often science is seen as being purely instrumental with nothing to contribute to these debates.",10
73,"Science, somehow, seems to be scarcely relevant to the most important issues in our life.",10
74,A proportion of both boys and girls at ego-identity achievement stage will choose science.,10
75,"In fact, most girls entering science are probably at this stage as they will need some self-examination and sense of commitment to make this unconventional choice.",10
76,"However, only a minority of adolescents will have reached the ego-identity achievement stage at the age when most pupils have to make crucial decisions about subject choice at school.",10
77,This model seems to explain our observations.,10
78,"A large number of boys, particularly at the foreclosure stage, are initially attracted to science but there is a drift away throughout later adolescence as they undergo some crisis.",10
79,"The preponderance of boys at the foreclosure stage will yield the rigid, authoritarian attitudes often associated with scientists.",10
80,The few girls who enter science will not usually show these foreclosure characteristics.,10
81,Effects of Curriculum Changes,10
82,The real use of this model linking personality development to subject choice is that it allows us to make predictions about how pupils might react to changes in school science curriculum and school organization.,10
83,We can consider three possible changes:,10
84,1,10
85,: Britain is unusual in asking pupils to make crucial choices about subject options in the 13–16 age range.,10
86,These decisions can only be reversed with great difficulty.,10
87,What effect would delaying the choice make?,10
88,"In the development through the years of adolescence the number of foreclosure pupils will diminish, hence the recruitment of boys into science would be cut.",10
89,More boys and girls will have reached the ego-identity achievement stage and a proportion of these will go into science.,10
90,"Overall there would be a reduction in the number of students choosing science, but those who so choose will be more likely to stay happily in the subject and to possess more flexible minds.",10
91,The quantitative loss would be met by a qualitative improvement.,10
92,2,10
93,": It is sometimes argued that science textbooks are sexist in showing illustrations of boys, girls, doing practical work in the laboratory, .",10
94,What effect would a  deliberate attempt to change this image have?,10
95,It might make it easier for girls at the foreclosure stage to accept science so recruitment might increase.,10
96,"Some of these girls might, however, drift away again when they reach their crisis period.",10
97,"Unless the change in image was immense, boys would probably not be affected, science would still be an obvious, acceptable choice for a boy.",10
98,"Overall there would be some increase in the recruitment of girls, but no qualitative improvement.",10
99,3,10
100,": To obtain a major qualitative improvement to recruitment in science with more girls and with students possessing imaginative, flexible minds it would be necessary to make science appealing to boys and girls at the moratorium stage.",10
101,In that event science must be seen to be relevant to the issues which concern them.,10
102,The probable implication is that science would need to be presented in the context of the needs of society and individuals.,10
103,"Probably a case-study approach involving the application of science, and the interaction with other disciplines, would be needed.",10
104,Our knowledge about the girls' concern with personal relationships suggests that the introduction of some elements of the social sciences into the case studies might prove attractive.,10
105,Is it possible to change school science in this fashion and still preserve the essential character of science itself?,10
106,Clearly there would need to be some drastic pruning of content.,10
107,Perhaps science teachers should not attempt to cover their subjects so comprehensively.,10
108,A history teacher is content to cover the history of one country or continent over a few decades.,10
109,Perhaps we must make similar choices.,10
110,It is interesting to notice that the Association for Science Education (1979) policy statement in Britain and the proposals on school physics coming from the Institute for Science Education (IPN) in Kiel are advocating such changes.,10
111,"The difference is that we are now offering a formal psychological model to suggest that if we want to reduce the current encapsulation of science, if we want to recruit a different sort of student, then certain curriculum changes are needed.",10
112,Girl Friendly Science and the Girl Friendly School,10
113,Judith Whyte,10
114,Approximately three times as many boys as girls take O level physics and approximately four times as many take CSE physics.,10
115,Over 90 of entries in all technical subjects are from boys.,10
116,This means that schoolgirls are ineligible for a wide range of courses in further and higher education and for entry to occupations requiring a scientific or technical base.,10
117,"Female exclusion from science and technology, it is apparently by girls' own choice, also means that as citizens their ability to understand and control their environment is limited.",10
118,"Nevertheless, most schools consider they are already providing equal opportunities by neutral treatment of the two sexes (Bloomfield, 1984).",10
119,"In effect, ignoring the effects of gender in this way merely reinforces stereotyping because it does nothing to challenge the definition of certain aspects of the curriculum as masculine or feminine.",10
120,"Girls Into Science and Technology (GIST) was the first major schools-based project addressing problems of sex stereotyping at school, and was an example of ‘action research’ in education; the project simultaneously took action to improve girls' achievement in science and technology and investigated the reasons for their under-achievement.",10
121,The project team collaborated with teachers in eight co-educational comprehensive schools in the Greater Manchester area to devise and implement intervention strategies designed to improve girls' attitudes to the physical sciences and technical subjects.,10
122,Two other schools were involved as controls where attitude testing but no interventions took place.[…],10
123,The approach was collaborative: teachers were invited to work with the team as equal partners in the attempts both to investigate and find solutions to the GIST problem.,10
124,"However, very few of the teachers even recognized the issue as one of professional concern at the start of the project, and most of the first  two years was spent in establishing the educational importance of the issue and working towards the development of feasible intervention strategies.",10
125,"The project and its outcomes have been fully described elsewhere (Smail .,",10
126,"1982; Kelly, Whyte and Smail, 1984; Whyte in press).",10
127,"GIST had more success in altering children's attitudes than their subject choices, suggesting that it is easier to change attitudes and beliefs than actual behaviour.",10
128,Pupils in action schools became markedly less stereotyped than pupils in control schools.,10
129,They also had slightly more positive attitudes towards science and scientists and were less likely to define them as exclusively masculine.,10
130,"Despite some evidence of change in teachers' attitudes behaviour, they themselves were reluctant to admit that the project had influenced them.",10
131,"an evaluation report this may reflect an unwillingness to admit that in the past schools have been sex biased (Payne, Cuff and Hustler, 1984).",10
132,"The GIST hypothesis was that female under-achievement in science and technology is partly socially constructed by the school, an hypothesis based on research evidence critical feminist analysis (see, , Kelly, 1981).",10
133,During the project there was a shift locating the issue as one of girls' motivation towards attempts to change the nature of school science.,10
134,"One of the main gains from the GIST project has been the clarification of what is meant by a ‘girl friendly’, science, that is a science which will appeal equally to the interests and concerns of girls boys.[…]",10
135,Making Science More Girl Friendly,10
136,Several interventions were designed to make science more girl friendly.,10
137,"Schools and teachers tried curriculum development to build on girls' science interests, changing patterns of classroom interaction, single sex groups and classes.",10
138,"The largest scale intervention was the VISTA programme, which consisted of women scientists and technologists visiting schools to talk to children about an aspect of their jobs already being covered in the school science syllabus.",10
139,"VISTA made science more girl friendly in two ways: both boys and girls were offered an attractive image of a competent woman scientist, and talks concentrated on social and industrial applications of science, an element too often missing from science at school.",10
140,One school was so impressed by the children's positive reactions that they completely revamped the science work in the first two years to include more social and human applications of science.,10
141,"The survey of children's attitudes helped here: research Ormerod's (1971; Ormerod and Duckworth, 1975) had shown that girls were interested in the social implications of science, but did not tell teachers what the desirable teaching approach might be in practice.",10
142,Would science in the home be a starter?,10
143,"A question from our survey asked children whether they would like to know more about how a vacuum cleaner works; hardly anyone did, and girls were even less curious than boys.",10
144,This told us that any simplistic assumptions about featuring ‘female’ domestic interests in science would  probably meet with failure.,10
145,"The rest of the questionnaire about science curiosity showed that all the children were enthusiastic about learning science, and that girls were keen to know more about nature, the environment and medical science.",10
146,"Over 50 , and in some cases over 60 said they would like to learn about the human heart, germs and illnesses, how our muscles work, what food is good for you, life in the sea, what makes a rainbow appear and how a record is made.",10
147,It was helpful that these topics also interested boys.,10
148,"the science curriculum is structured around physical science interests, on which boys are keener (how motor cars work, atoms and molecules); we were able to recommend that teaching build on the overlapping interests of the two sexes, because girls boys want to know more about human biology and spectacular features of the environment (animals in the jungle, volcanoes and earthquakes, acids and chemicals).",10
149,"The less immediately attractive parts of science could be approached through these interests, teaching ‘forces’ by beginning with the action of muscles in the human arm, and ‘light’via the dissection of a bull's eye.",10
150,"When women scientists employ such approaches, and describe their own work, as happened during the VISTA programme, girls are receiving double encouragement.",10
151,"These examples indicate some of the features of girl friendly science: it builds on girls' interests, not just boys'; it explicitly encourages girls to see themselves as potential scientists, and it includes some of the social and human implications and applications of science.",10
152,Other GIST Interventions,10
153,"All the GIST schools were mixed comprehensives, and teachers were most unwilling to separate boys and girls , on the grounds that it ran counter to their co-educational comprehensive philosophy.",10
154,Then certain teachers were particularly struck by the evidence of large differences in the interests and experience children brought with them to school.,10
155,Girls had far less ‘tinkering’ experience than boys and the connection with their lesser interest in topics like ‘how electricity is produced’seemed obvious.,10
156,Several special science or craft clubs were organized in the lunch hour for girls only and in two schools teachers planned single-sex teaching.,10
157,"As we shall see, it was in these two schools that the largest measurable changes of attitude and option choice occurred.",10
158,"For a more girl friendly science, it seems vital that teachers should come to see that when all the masculine packaging, evident in textbooks and resources teachers' and boys' behaviour in the classroom, is removed, girls can be very enthusiastic about science.[…]",10
159,Alison Kelly sees four distinct senses in which it can be argued that science is masculine.,10
160,"First, the pupils, teachers and practitioners of science are overwhelmingly male numbers; second, school science is packaged and presented to appeal to boys, not girls; third, classroom behaviours and interaction operate to reconstruct science as a male activity, and  finally it has been suggested that ‘scientific’ thinking embodies an intrinsically masculine world view.",10
161,"The GIST interventions described above relate to three of these: VISTA women, albeit briefly and temporarily, redressed the numerical balance by offering female role models of practising scientists; VISTA and the curriculum development which followed involved a limited ‘repackaging’ of science to remove its exclusively masculine appeal, and the single-sex classes and classroom observation showed how science comes to be defined as ‘masculine’in the mixed school.",10
162,"The fourth point, the idea that science is intrinsically masculine, can be sustained only by clinging to an irredeemably narrow conception of science and scientific thinking.",10
163,"The industrial and social impact of science on health, on people, on the environment, a focus on the beauty and complexity of the natural world, are notable omissions from the school science syllabus.",10
164,"Girls are not uninterested in science, they are bored by the limited version of it they meet in school.",10
165,"One of the purposes of an extended period of single-sex science teaching might be to let teachers see how girls approach scientific matters, and to discover, what may well be the case, that girls are just as capable of ‘scientific thinking’ as boys.",10
166,"Margaret Spear, in a different study from the one reported in this volume, found that for identical work boys were marked higher than girls for supposed understanding of principles, aptitude for science and O level suitability (Spear, 1984).",10
167,Outcomes,10
168,Children enjoyed the VISTA visits the questionnaire returns in the third year; they liked meeting scientists and learning about a range of jobs.,10
169,Girls were slightly more positive than boys.,10
170,"Overall, the attitudes of children in the action schools where all the interventions took place became noticeably more liberal, especially on sex role and occupational stereotypes and the ‘masculinity’ of science.",10
171,", attitudes to science itself became more negative.",10
172,"This is a universal phenomenon (Gardner, 1984).",10
173,"Children begin secondary school with high expectations of science, but become disillusioned and uninterested, especially in physics.",10
174,"However, the decline in science interest was less marked in GIST action than in control schools, indicating a possible causal effect of the VISTA visits and other interventions, and on boys as much as girls.",10
175,"It appears that if girls' interests are catered for, if teachers become aware of the need for careful classroom management to ensure girls' participation, if the social and human implications of science and technology are stressed, girls will respond positively.",10
176,"There will continue to be problems if science teachers are personally doubtful about girls' ability to do science well; their doubts are not voiced (and anecdotal evidence suggests they sometimes are), girls are unlikely to respond unless teachers show they believe that girls have something to offer science the reverse.",10
177,The significant difference between action and control schools concerning attitudes was not matched by an action/control difference in option choices.,10
178,In most schools the percentage of girls choosing physics in the GIST cohort increased previous years.,10
179,"However, the increase in control schools was as large as in the action schools!",10
180,The girl friendly school,10
181,Unfortunately the pattern of option choice and attitude differences is not perfectly matched within each school.,10
182,", certain action schools were successful in changing attitudes, while others were successful in shifting option choices.",10
183,Only one school was successful on both counts.,10
184,The implication is that pupil attitude change is not sufficient on its own to ensure that pupils will actually make non-traditional option choices.,10
185,"Presumably the major mediating factors are the teachers, and the school, concerned.",10
186,Teacher Attitudes,10
187,[…],10
188,The most interesting aspect of the teachers' response is their unwillingness to admit to any change of attitude or practice as a result of GIST.,10
189,"Yet both the field notes and the evaluation report provide clear evidence that the staff had become much more aware of, and informed about, girls' under-achievement in science and technology and the possible actions which schools could take.",10
190,"Many mentioned the practical steps they had already devised: altering curriculum materials, deliberately avoiding the use of stereotyped language, studying patterns of classroom interaction and thinking of ways to increase girls' participation.",10
191,"The evaluators noted the grudgingness of teachers to admit to changes in their own beliefs or practices and ascribed it to an unwillingness to accept the implied criticism that previous practice had, even unintentionally, discouraged girls.",10
192,"A national survey of teachers' attitudes to equal opportunities found that men were more likely to be opposed to promoting equal opportunities than women, but that differences in subject taught were more important than the sex of the teacher in determining his or her attitude.",10
193,"Teachers of maths, physical science and crafts were the least greater equality (Pratt, Bloomfield and Seale, 1984).",10
194,Spear also found in a study of teachers' attitudes to girls and technology that the most sex-differentiated replies came from science teachers (Spear in this volume).,10
195,"On both counts, of sex and subjects taught, the GIST teachers were the least promising group which could have been chosen to promote sex equality.",10
196,"Alison Kelly worked with some of her students to carry out a minor evaluation of changes in GIST teachers' attitudes a national sample (Kelly .,",10
197,1984).,10
198,"Women again proved to be more emphatic about  sex equality than men, and London teachers were more feminist than others.",10
199,GIST teachers were slightly less traditional and more equality of the sexes than other teachers.,10
200,Teachers in GIST schools were also slightly more likely to agree with statements suggesting that girls ‘lose out’ in classroom interactions and receive less encouragement in science than boys.,10
201,"This is likely to be an effect of the classroom observation work carried out with GIST teachers (for a full account see Whyte, 1984).",10
202,"However, the GIST teachers of physical science were less convinced than their colleagues elsewhere of the importance of finding ways to encourage girls in their subject.",10
203,"It may be that their experience of GIST has given them a better idea of the amount of work and energy involved in trying to change things (Kelly .,",10
204,1984).,10
205,School atmosphere,10
206,"Whatever may be the attitude of any individual teacher, if s/he does not receive adequate support from the school in implementing change, s/he is likely to give up, or decide that the innovation is not worth the extra time and energy required.",10
207,[…,10
208,]The extent to which GIST was successful in particular schools appears to have been less dependent on the team's efforts than on the existing school ethos and whether it was consistent with responding to the demand for genuine equality of opportunity.,10
209,"In other words, the project probably did not change schools, but change may have been most likely to occur in schools which were open to the innovation and to the ideas of equality presented by the project.",10
210,"Closer study of between-school differences (see Kelly .,",10
211,1984; Whyte in press) shows that attitude change was most marked in three action schools.,10
212,"In one, Moss Green, there had also been an increase in the percentage of girls opting for chemistry, physics and technical crafts.",10
213,"In the other two, Edgehill and Meadowvale, there had been an increase in two of these.",10
214,"These schools appeared to have several things : first, each could be characterized as an ‘innovative’ school in some sense.",10
215,"Moss Green was a custom-built community school, with a commitment to multicultural education and a staff who were used to implementing innovations open-plan classrooms, and, more recently, an alternative curriculum for fourth and fifth years.",10
216,"At Edgehill, the science department was divided into biological and environmental sciences, the traditional biology, physics and chemistry; the head teacher was a conscious advocate of innovation in comprehensive schooling; in the third school, Meadowvale, the science department had decided to redraft its entire first and second year science curriculum, because of the children's response to the VISTA visits organized by GIST.",10
217,"The least successful schools were those which implemented the minimum programme asked for by GIST: administration of questionnaires to children, allowing women visitors into the school and piloting, more or less reluctantly, teaching materials devised by the team.",10
218,"The successful schools, in contrast, took up more GIST suggestions more enthusiastically, or even developed their own ideas for interventions.",10
219,"at Edgehill, a GIST pack for discussion of sex roles —— was used in the personal and social education lessons, with teachers talking honestly and openly about their personal experience; as it happened they found themselves in the middle of a discussion about fathers being present at childbirth, and the children were obviously fascinated by this new view of their teachers as emotional beings.[…]",10
220,Willingness to talk directly to pupils about the aims of GIST was another feature of the more successful schools.,10
221,"Despite requests from the team to discuss the issue with children, few teachers revealed the purpose of the project to their classes.",10
222,"Some teachers told the evaluators that they did not feel justified in talking to pupils about the girls and science problem, and gave the impression that they felt to do so would be tantamount to propaganda.",10
223,"At Moss Green, GIST was called in to address the second-year class before they made craft mini-options, to stress how important it was for girls to consider getting a grounding in technology.",10
224,Far greater numbers of girls opted for technical subjects than had ever done so before.,10
225,The school also ran single-sex clubs.,10
226,"In comparison, there was no visible explicit discussion of sex roles at either of the two least successful schools.",10
227,"The GIST workpack,, was used at another school, but a senior member of management had effectively insisted they use it, and some teachers did so with considerable reservations, afterwards reporting almost complete failure to alter children's prejudices.",10
228,"We had looked for some impact from the presence of women in senior positions in school, but the highest percentage of women at Scale 4 or above in any school was 35 .",10
229,"In the more successful schools, women held relatively more senior posts in the science department or in the school.",10
230,"In the two least successful schools it is notable that the proportion of senior women was lowest, in one case despite the fact that the head teacher was a woman.",10
231,"In summary, the most successful schools appeared to have the following characteristics:",10
232,teachers who planned and implemented their own interventions;,10
233,"teachers who were prepared to discuss the GIST problem with children, simply accepting VISTA and other interventions and hoping that an implicit message would get through;",10
234,"staff, especially at a senior level, who had a positive commitment to the aims of the project;",10
235,a progressive ethos which fitted comfortably with the equal-opportunity aims of GIST;,10
236,a relatively higher proportion of women staff at senior levels.,10
237,[…],10
238,"The third element, the innovative practice advocated, became refined during before the project.",10
239,The use of questionnaires fed back to teachers revealed the base of interest and enthusiasm for science too often missed by schools concerned to promote a curriculum informally based on male interests.,10
240,Observation in labs and workshops highlighted the depressing effect on girls' performance of the boys' claim to science as their subject.,10
241,"We are much clearer now than at the beginning about how to approach science in a more girl friendly way (see Smail, 1983, 1984), and the clarity is due to the way we have worked with teachers.",10
242,"The conditions for a girl friendly school may be more difficult to bring about, for it would seem that teachers must be openly and visibly concerned about equality before pupils will change their choices; schools with traditional norms, limited or formal communication channels, and with few women in senior positions will be much slower to adapt to changed female expectations.",10
243,Conclusion,10
244,[…],10
245,"Teachers were always busy, and many schools put GIST on a rather lower priority than dealing with the impact of unemployment, school reorganization, discipline or curricular problems.",10
246,"It was often difficult to get schools to provide even basic information the breakdown of subject choice by sex, and members of the team frequently had to extract the information themselves from school data.",10
247,"Oddly enough, the control schools, where no interventions took place, were more co-operative and efficient in returning questionnaires than action schools.",10
248,"Similarly, the impact of GIST may have been as great in schools which had no contact with the project , the changing climate of opinion in which girls' under-achievement in science and technology came to be seen as a serious educational issue.",10

254,The Social Nature of the Curriculum,10
255,"(a) Three Curricular Traditions and their Implications, Ivor Goodson",10
256,Since the nineteenth century ‘academic subjects’ and written examinations have become closely interconnected.,10
257,"The alliance, whether viewed as divine or malign, was formally enshrined in the School Certificate examination defined in 1917.",10
258,Since that date certain material implications have followed for those subgroups and school subjects promoting or representing the academic tradition.,10
259,Questions of theoretical base or methodological perspective have often been subsumed by or channelled into the construction of acceptable written examinations.,10
260,"For the groups and associations promoting themselves as school subjects, and irresistibly drawn to claiming ‘academic status’, a central criterion has been whether the subjects' content could be tested by written examinations for an ‘able’ clientele.",10
261,Acceptance of the criterion of examinability affects both the content and form of the knowledge presented but carries with it the guarantee of high status.,10
262,The academic tradition is content-focused and typically stresses abstract and theoretical knowledge for examination.,10
263,"The utilitarian tradition is conversely of low status, dealing with practical knowledge sometimes not amenable to the current A level mode of written examination.",10
264,Utilitarian knowledge is related to those non-professional vocations in which the majority of people work for most of their adult life.,10
265,"The low status of utilitarian knowledge also applies to the personal, social and commonsense knowledge stressed by those pursuing the pedagogic tradition.",10
266,Whilst all school knowledge has an implicit pedagogy this tradition places the ‘way the child learns’ as the central concern in devising subject content.,10
267,"These traditions are viewed as three ‘centres of gravity’, in the arguments about styles of curriculum.",10
268,They do not represent a complete list of the ‘traditions’ in English curricula nor are they timeless entities; they simply represent three clear constellations of curriculum styles which recur in the  history of the school subjects under study.,10
269,In this sense they are perhaps best viewed as strategic clusters employed to help in the scrutiny of curriculum changes and conflicts.[…],10
270,"The existence of academic, pedagogic and utilitarian traditions in school curricula has its origins in the separate sectors of the educational system which preceded the comprehensive era.",10
271,The continuance of these traditions and the continuing dominance of the academic tradition bear testimony that the fundamental structures of curriculum have withstood comprehensive reorganization.,10
272,"As in the tripartite system so in the comprehensive system, academic subjects for able pupils are accorded the highest status and resources.",10
273,"The triple alliance between academic subjects, academic examinations and able pupils ensures that comprehensive schools provide similar patterns of curriculum differentiation to previous school systems.",10
274,"For the teachers who have to cater for all kinds of pupils this concentration on a particular kind of pupil and a particular kind of educational success poses the same dilemma voiced by the rural studies teacher the promotion of academic examinations in his subject; ‘we can see the unwanted children of lower intelligence being made servants of the juggernaut of documented evidence, the inflated examination.’",10
275,This conclusion summarizes the continuing choice:,10
276,True education is not for every man the scrap of paper he leaves school with.,10
277,Dare we as teachers admit this?,10
278,Dare we risk our existence by forcibly expressing our views on this?,10
279,While we pause after the first phase of our acceptance are we to rely on exams for all to prove ourselves worthy of the kindly eye of the state?,10
280,"The deep structures of curriculum differentiation are historically linked to different educational sectors, to different social class clienteles and occupational destinations, to different status hierarchies.",10
281,Differentiated curricula and the social structure are matched on very firm foundations: by building on these foundations comprehensive reorganization has had to accept the antecedent structures which contradict its stated ideal.[…],10
282,"The legacy of differentiated status for the academic, utilitarian and pedagogic traditions draws on tripartite patterns of educational organization.",10
283,In considering curriculum change it is vital to understand that this tripartite hierarchy of status has been reproduced not only in the respective parity of esteem different categories of subject but also to kinds of knowledge subjects.,10
284,"At the later level, scrutiny of ‘what counts as education’ is necessary.",10
285,", much of the debate about teaching craft and technology as a way of reinstating practical curricula has missed this point.",10
286,Given the status patterns discerned one might expect that technology were to achieve high status and acceptance the version which would ‘count as education’ would be academic and theoretical and therefore stand in contradiction to more practical objectives.,10
287,"The differentiated status of academic, utilitarian and pedagogic traditions pervades both the type of subject and the  internal form of each subject.",10
288,Curriculum reform needs to address both of these levels of differentiation.,10
289,The differentiated status of the three curriculum traditions discerned and their link with the way finance and resources are allocated and pursued is confirmed by a number of studies already undertaken.,10
290,Banks' study of parity and prestige in the English secondary system ends by stressing ‘the persistence of the academic tradition’ throughout that period of the system's existence.’,10
291,Hanson's study of art education and Dodd's work on technology offer similar evidence.a The latter speaking of the Crowther Report noted that they had shown how ‘an alternative route to knowledge’ lay through practical subjects which did not destroy the intellectual curiosity of the pupil in the way associated with the ‘academic’ones.,10
292,Dodd notes that ‘the problems lay in the status of practical subjects by tradition second class….,10
293,"Discussion on its own is insufficient and it requires legitimization by those institutions who hold this facility (universities, examination boards, employers and society ).’",10
294,"As we have seen, the legitimizing institutions together with established and indeed aspiring subject groups share the vested interest in the belief that ‘a scholarly discipline’ is needed if a school subject is to be granted high status.",10
295,The stranglehold of the academic tradition has seldom been seriously threatened by its overwhelming need to shun ‘practical utility’.,10
296,The theme which Dodd points to was just as common when the 1904 regulations were established.,10
297,"A contemporary noted that the school curriculum was ‘subordinated to that literary instruction which makes for academic culture, but is of no practical utility, to the classes for whom the local authorities should principally cater’.",10
298,The dominance of the academic tradition is patently supported by the major vested interest groups within education and the broader society.,10
299,Yet the very need for academic subjects to escape from allegations of ‘practical utility’ may yet lead to irresistible pressure for change in the period of economic malaise which we currently confront.,10
300,"(b) The Schooling of Science, Michael F. D. Young",10
301,Science emerged later as a branch of education and its assimilation into the existing institutions and structures was not achieved without some noticeable exercises of accommodation.,10
302,"This view of the incorporation of natural science into the school curriculum is taken by David Layton, who offers us a valuable account of this process of ‘accommodation’ in the late nineteenth century, complementary to his earlier study of the demise of ‘the science of common things’.",10
303,"he describes how one conception of ‘pure’ laboratory science was established which enabled school science to be justified the prevailing tradition of liberal education and its devotion to ‘the discipline of the mind, the attainment of habits of controlled attention and the exercise of reasoning powers and memory’.",10
304,Thus Chemistry and Physics could comfortably claim a place alongside the Classics and Mathematics.,10
305,"Likewise, the purpose of introducing science into the secondary schools was never in doubt to such leading advocates as H. E. Roscoe, the first President of the Association of Public School Science Masters (the precursor of our Association for Science Education); school science was, for Roscoe, as Layton quotes him, to be ‘the means of sifting out from the great mass of the people those golden grains of genius which now are too often lost amongst the sands of mediocrity’.",10
306,"A consequence of this accommodation was, as Layton puts it, that ‘the application of science to everyday life had (by the 1870s) disappeared…the learner [only those learners who experienced any science teaching — M.Y.]",10
307,was slowly inducted into the ways of the scientist — a particular type of scientist also — the ‘pure’’ researcher’.,10
308,"Largely through the method of government recognition and financing of laboratories, the separation of school science into separate ‘subjects’, physics, chemistry, and biology, became firmly established before the end of the century, as did for quite other reasons the exclusion of geology.",10
309,"Furthermore, the models of ‘subject’ teaching which dominated (and in many ways still do) experimental work were part of this process.",10
310,"As Layton describes it, school chemistry became the ‘easily organized and easily examined exercises in qualitative analysis…[in which]packets of powder were sent out [to the schools]and packets of paper were returned when the pupils had completed the routine of taking the solution through the charts’; if anyone asked ‘why?’, ‘training of the faculties of observation and reasoning’ would doubtless have been the reply.",10
311,"Likewise in physics pupils were offered ‘a starvation course on the precise measurement of physical quantities…[for, as an influential text of the time began]‘Physics is essentially the science of measurements’’.",10
312,", many things have changed, but even in the Nuffield era ‘the emphasis has remained on abstract…‘technically sweet’ science, dissociated from its applications and implications’.",10
313,"Before turning to the attempts to revitalize science teaching which have emerged since the early 1960s, it is important to ask the question ‘Why did school science emerge in the way it did?’",10
314,"Is it adequate to see it as an accommodation to existing educational structures, as Layton does?",10
315,I suggest we need to try and grasp both the innovations Layton describes and the structures they confronted their wider political and economic significance.,10
316,"Alternative traditions of science education in which scientific knowledge was conceived, among other things ‘as an instrument in the pursuit of political independence and social emancipation’, had, Layton writes, become ‘casualties in a process of natural selection as the educational environment had become progressively more sharply defined’.",10
317,"The problem with this kind of social Darwinist view is that it treats a process, selection, as , as an outcome of certain activities and interests in particular historical contexts.",10
318,"This is indicated in Layton's references to the views of science on the one hand ‘the disinterested pursuit of truth’, and on the other, particularly by those involved in the Great Exhibition, as ‘the producer for the industrial market place (science was to be studied for the economic benefits it would yield)’.",10
319,The question of economic benefits of science points to a concern with the character of the economy at the time and to the importance of considering the demise of the attempts to implement a science curriculum ‘as practice’ and the success of the science curriculum ‘as fact’in the context of changes in Victorian capitalism.[…],10
320,"Science education was envisaged, as David Layton tells us, by some early nineteenth century radicals like Richard Carlile as undermining dogma and leading to social emancipation.",10
321,"The process and practice of the schooling of science, for all its changes, has become almost the opposite —‘necessarily dogmatic’ Jevons and many others, and producing technological domination emancipation.",10
322,This paper has largely been limited to the processes within education — the ways they have been part of a wider process of economic and political domination have been little more than hinted at.,10
323,"Inevitably oversimplifying, I would summarize what I have tried to say by suggesting that the schooling of science has produced three kinds of people, whose interrelations have now led to opposition to any attempts to realize the emancipatory potential Carlile saw.",10
324,They are:,10
325,(a),10
326,"‘Pure scientists’, whose relations with nature are those of abstracted understanding.",10
327,"This is not to deny the discoveries that have been made, but to state that the purposes that have given meaning to the scientists' pursuit of truth have been success in and the sustaining of the scientific establishment.",10
328,(b),10
329,"The ‘applied scientist’ whose identity is fundamentally pragmatic — given something to be done, he [or she]will work out how to do it.",10
330,"Ends are given, but asks by or for whom.",10
331,"Just as the pure scientist, from his [or her]early training, absolves himself [or herself]from the uses to which  his [or her]discoveries are put, seeing that the discoveries themselves are inescapably linked to an economy on which he [or she]depends for support, so the applied scientist accepts that others define the goals that he [or she]has to achieve seeing that his [or her]own means or technology itself presupposes a social order, set of priorities or goals.",10
332,(c),10
333,"The identifiable failures of school science — the anti-science anti-technologists who can see science as domination that science as domination is itself a historical product, and the mass of people whose schooling teaches them that science is a specialized activity over which they neither have nor could have any control.",10
334,"(c) The Curriculum and National Identity, Chris Brown",10
335,It is no coincidence that mass schooling was invented at roughly the time when nation states had come into existence and the need arose to instil in their citizens the idea that the new entity had first claim on their loyalties.,10
336,"The more social cohesion was rendered problematic by the existence of cleavages ethnicity, language etc. the more important was an efficient schooling system.",10
337,The example of the United States is well known:,10
338,…each American school has a national flag flying outside the school and usually a flag in each classroom.,10
339,"Also, the national anthem is regularly used in school assemblies and sporting events: and paintings of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and other historic American figures are prominent in schools.",10
340,"(Nelson, 1978, pp. 145–6)[…]",10
341,In Britain it is the curriculum which bears the main burden of transmitting the national idea.,10
342,"History may be cited as an example, not least because in the post-Falklands era several leading figures, including Sir Keith Joseph and Professor Hugh Thomas, have singled it out for special mention ‘understanding the shared values which are a distinctive feature of British Society’.",10
343,"Despite developments Schools Council history and a growing interest in African, Caribbean and Indian history, school history is unlikely ever to escape the grip of nationalism.[…]",10
344,Could one envisage a curriculum without history?,10
345,Many people would feel that if children grew up to know nothing of their ‘heritage’ this would be a serious threat to national identity.,10
346,"People may not remember whatever detailed analysis was developed for them as schoolchildren, but certain models or ‘general sketches’…do remain, and they inform everyday thinking closely, especially as they are exercised over and again by politicians and the media seeking to make public sense of current events.",10
347,"If an example is needed to make this clearer one can be found in the special place occupied by the Second World War in public consciousness in Britain and, more particularly, in Margaret Thatcher's increasingly deliberate manipulation of Churchillian sketches over the period of the Falklands crisis.",10
348,"(Wright, 1984, pp. 49–50)",10
349,"Unlike history, the ‘new’ geography would appear to have rid itself of imperialist associations.",10
350,"However, quite the persistence of a great deal of ‘geography of the British Isles’ syllabuses, the new scientific and conceptual geography has not appeared in schools some intrinsic merit.",10
351,"On the contrary, its growth coincided with the collapse of empire.",10
352,"the world was politically, and militarily, if not economically, permeated with British influence, school geography could safely and fruitfully explore even the most unlikely regions.",10
353,In a world where British influence is conspicuously waning it might not be in the interests of a secure national identity to throw it open for young Britons to gaze on.,10
354,"History, on the other hand, can be continually re-written to buttress the national ideal.",10
355,There is little point in reviewing every curriculum subject.,10
356,Historical and sociological studies of the curriculum have shown us that school subjects are not simply rationally selected for explicit educational aims but are reflections of larger social and political forces.,10
357,Not all subjects contribute equally to fostering national identity.,10
358,Nor do they all function in the same way.,10
359,"Science makes its contribution by studiously avoiding social and political comment: it thus misses the way that it is inextricably bound up with dominant values, amongst them attitudes which assume ethnocentric and nationalistic positions.",10
360,Even modern languages may be detached from their respective cultures and contribute to the unspoken notion that other societies are slightly queer.,10
361,"The point is that in nation-states, education systems are provided by the state authorities and will thus inevitably have the net effect of focusing positive views of the nation they serve.",10
362,Britain may not need to flaunt nationalism in the way characteristic of the United States but its education system can no more ignore the task of sustaining the national identity than education systems in any other nation-state.,10
363,"(d) Contrasting Models in School Geography, Rob Gilbert",10
364,Differences between explaining physical processes and human action make impossible a unified society-environment study based on a single explanatory paradigm.,10
365,Explanatory models which serve for one cannot serve for the other.,10
366,The dominance of the traditions of environmental and economic determinism are a handicap to further profitable application of geographical knowledge to human affairs.,10
367,As one geographer has pointed out:,10
368,"…until subject matter theories with different epistemological characteristics have been formulated, the focus of our spatial planning must continue to be on supermarkets, roads and airports, and not on the needs and desires of those individual human beings that the facilities allegedly are constructed to serve.",10
369,"This tradition and its inherent contradictions have been noted before, as when an historian of the discipline wrote almost twenty years ago:",10
370,"Many geographers have never been deeply concerned with ultimate objectives of social character, and some would sincerely regard efforts to provide directives for human action as presumptuous and arrogant.",10
371,"But sooner or later writers ask whether geography really is a human study , possibly because some writers on human geography appear to have studied almost everything except the people.",10
372,"That environmentalism may be superseded in schools, as it appears largely to have been in universities, by the locational analysis school is no guarantee of a more appropriate form of explanation.",10
373,"For, as has been suggested in the texts reviewed, the old paradigms may merely be replaced by a new form of determinism, this time based on space.",10
374,Here again the results of human activity are explained without recourse to conscious human agents or social contexts.,10
375,The locational analysis school can be said to have,10
376,reified ‘the spatial’ as the basis of the subject matter of the discipline.,10
377,"At the same time it diverted attention the underlying structural explanations of society and economy, as part of a general process of ‘mystification’ whereby surface manifestations are confused for root causes.",10
378,"Thus statements in the text material which attribute spatial differences to ‘different kinds of people’, or government planning, or factors of location the availability and stability of a labour market, have arbitrarily stopped the causal chain at a point which omits social, economic and political  considerations.",10
379,"To claim that explanation in geography can go no further is only to say that it is inadequate to its task, and ignores the fact that many geographers are going further:",10
380,Geographical differentiation is a detail — albeit an important detail — and a result of the operation of social systems.,10
381,It is not a fundamental property of such systems.,10
382,The space-economy is simply the spatial pattern of organization created by the industrial economy; it is not an independent variable.,10
383,"This point has been clearly demonstrated by recent reconsiderations of, , the nature of uneven regional development and economic under-development which show that both processes, whilst creating spatial patterns are, more fundamentally, outcomes of the operation of the economy the result of autonomous geographical factors.",10
384,"To concentrate on the latter is not only superficial, it is also incorrect.",10
385,The images of human nature and society built into the explanatory paradigms which dominate school curricula and texts are inadequate.,10
386,"They restrict the extent to which human action can be understood, substituting explanations based on a plastic model of the individual and a narrow and amorphous model of social relations and structure.",10
387,"In focusing on concrete outcomes of social activity, and explaining them through natural causal models, geographers have disguised the social origins of these outcomes and the political assumptions and implications of their theories.",10
388,"Olsson, in his analysis of urban geographical theories and their usefulness, concludes that:",10
389,the explanatory power and potential planning applicability of geographic theory does not depend on the employed and usually specified spatial axioms but rather on the unspecified axioms about individual and group behaviour.,10
390,"Until these underlying images of individual and society are recognized, and their study given the explicit attention it deserves, the significance of geographical knowledge for social practice will not be realized, nor the constraints it currently imposes overcome.",10
391,"(e)‘Political’ Differences in English Teaching, Margaret Mathieson",10
392,"As it has been seen to touch upon every aspect of pupils' lives, most particularly the emotional, English has become increasingly diffuse.",10
393,"Moreover, there are within it, more than most other subjects, marked political differences between the leading figures in the field.",10
394,"As they relate to decision-making about priorities and responsibilities in the classroom, these differences must affect many English teachers' sense of purpose and professional confidence.[…]",10
395,"Before examining conflicting views about priorities within the four main activities within English — literature, creativity, discrimination, and classroom talk — it is useful to consider the term ‘political’ in reference to definitions currently being made by leading figures concerned with English in schools.",10
396,"Within the last ten years, during which time interest had shifted to the curriculum of the average and below-average child, widespread dissatisfaction has been expressed with the traditional grammar school education.",10
397,"Its specialist, academic, authoritarian elements have been persistently criticized, partly because they ignored progressives' demands for children's activity, participation and development through discovery, and partly the perceived irrelevance of this education to the lives of working-class children, the majority of whom have failed to benefit from it.",10
398,"Progressives, and radicals supporting reorganization of the schools and the introduction of non-streaming, are carrying their attack upon the grammar schools' élitism into the curriculum, dismantling the traditional subjects by rearranging them through interdisciplinary work, projects and themes.",10
399,"As this relates to English, the central concern of which has been the dissemination of liberal culture throughout society, it has undergone considerable revision.",10
400,"Literature, usually the major part of English in the grammar schools, has received the most severe overhauling, but the current unacceptability to many educators of a ‘middle-class’ curriculum for all our pupils, every activity in English has been given a different set of emphases.[…]",10
401,"Recent anxiety about the grammar schools' perceived responsibility for reinforcing divisions between the middle and working classes, and about the wastage of talent which their continued existence perpetuated, has brought their traditional curriculum under severe attack.",10
402,", as far as English has been concerned, others besides progressives and radicals have questioned the value of academic approaches for working-class pupils.",10
403,"G. H. Bantock and David Holbrook, who are very concerned about exploitation by commercial culture of working-class pupils, have argued that the watered-down grammar school curriculum has failed to affect the lives of the great majority.",10
404,"Although not wishing to disturb the present social system in any fundamental way, they, like the radical educators, have proposed the revival of popular culture.",10
405,"set books, periods of literature and preparation for examinations, they propose more mime, dance, poetry reading and writing, an affective  education for pupils unreceptive to the academic, and susceptible to the commercial.",10
406,"Thus, both radicals and élitists have severely shaken the early certainty about the worthwhileness of attempts to disseminate liberal culture as widely as teachers' skills and school conditions permitted.",10
407,"And within recent years, the question of which culture is for whom is being raised every one of their activities.",10
408,"If literature and its related activities are tainted with ‘middle-class’ exclusiveness and, it appears, that teachers engaging pupils in these are ‘imposing’alien values upon working-class pupils, it follows that they must move into the lives of working-class pupils to encourage that culture which, now, the largely irrelevant curriculum has ‘stifled’[…]",10
409,After surveying the general scene it is useful to look at existing differences between educators about each of the four main activities.,10
410,The teaching of literature has been the activity most profoundly affected by these conflicting views.,10
411,"Pupils of Leavis continue to support his concept of the centrality of the literary experience, denying its identification with middle-class culture and the charge of imposing alien values upon working-class children.",10
412,"Although G. H. Bantock and David Holbrook attack the ‘watered-down’ curriculum for secondary modern children, they insist upon the value of literature in the school experience of all pupils.",10
413,"They suggest approaching the average and below-average children through mime, dance and personal composition.",10
414,"Nevertheless, the proposed stimuli are myth and folk song and, hopefully, these are meant to lead on to the poetry of Blake and Shakespeare.",10
415,"Like Arnold and Leavis these writers, concerned above all with what Holbrook calls the children's ‘humanity’, believe that this can be touched and sensitized by engagement with great works of art.",10
416,"Today, Holbrook and his supporters, opposing the shift of emphasis to ‘relevant’ social or environmental studies, simply disclaim the accusation of endorsing middle-class values; they insist upon the universality of the literary experience which, if neglected, will mean severe imaginative deprivation for children continually exposed to what, they argue, are the banalities of the mass media.[…]",10
417,The unwillingness of some English teachers to teach literature stems from their convictions about the neglected richness of working-class culture.,10
418,"While the team wish to order priorities differently and the Humanities Project's teachers wish to rearrange literature to illustrate relevant social issues, there is an extreme form of resistance to literature on the grounds that it is part of the ‘syllabus of established middle-class culture’.",10
419,"In , a book about English teaching in Stepney, Chris Searle expresses his belief in the validity of working-class culture and the English teacher's responsibility to encourage children's pride in their own identity.",10
420,"Literature, a reference to the Liverpool poets, is excluded from his working-class pupils' experience of English in school.",10
421,"Instead, Searle proposes stimulation of pupil's personal writing about their feelings and environment.",10
422,"Having identified the academic curriculum with competitive  examinations and the status-seeking of the middle  , Searle excludes all works of art from the classroom except the pupils' own creations and those which reflect their lives.",10
423,"Although their reasons differ and their perspectives on literature conflict, the élitists like Bantock and Holbrook and a radical like Searle face English teachers with proposals based on similar assumptions.",10
424,"Arguing that the curriculum of the working-class pupils should be specially chosen to suit their environment, experiences and abilities, they indicate their lack of interest in the question of academic achievement with its possibility of pupils' upward social mobility.",10
425,"Bantock and Holbrook seek no reorganization of the social structure, investing their hopes for greater happiness in the power of creativity and great art to bring self-awareness and fulfilment.",10
426,"Searle, and teachers with his views, reject the present social system, recommending that ways be found to give working-class pupils confidence and pride in their cultural identity.",10
427,"They do not propose to enter into work in school which makes achievement in competitive examinations possible, having judged this to be highly undesirable.",10
428,Turning to the field of children's creativity we find that the area of agreement is far larger than that about literature.,10
429,"So strong have been the influences here — of progressivism with its romantic view of childhood's vision, of anti-industrialism, of egalitarianism which has democratized art in every form, of therapy — that the great majority of educators wish to encourage pupils' growth through creativity.",10
430,Disagreement is mainly about whether great literature or the children's own environment and experiences should provide the stimuli for this work.,10
431,It is a debate which reflects the overall political dispute about the role of high art in the classroom.,10
432,"While Bantock, Holbrook, Inglis and those English teachers who support the ‘élitists’, recommend the employment of stimuli drawn exclusively from the music, painting and literature of high art, and make it clear that they view creativity partly as a way back into appreciation, a radical teacher like Searle rejects this culture completely.",10
433,"Unlike the élitists, many of whom wish to compensate for working-class children's loss of traditional agricultural satisfactions through a mainly affective curriculum, Searle recommends creativity to strengthen working-class children's confidence and pride in their own identity.",10
434,"The severest critics of exclusively personal, creative writing are the team, who argue that such work does not help pupils achieve social competence.",10
435,"[…]. The charge is that exclusive concentration upon the personal can, in its effects, be socially divisive.",10
436,"Unless working-class children are given linguistic means of control over the disciplines of the curriculum, and situations in the outside world, they are unlikely to stand much chance of being upwardly mobile.",10
437,What this criticism draws attention to is the bitter truth about teachers' exclusive concentration upon creativity with working-class pupils.,10
438,"Whether this is stimulated by the myths and ballads proposed by David Holbrook, or is a reflection upon the living conditions of society's victims suggested by Searle, teachers' limitation of the pupils' work in English  to ‘personal’ writing can be interpreted as giving their support to the of the social system.",10
439,"Since this decision relates, in English, to what has come to be accepted as a key element in children's potential to achieve at school, that is their linguistic competence, the English teacher has a heavier responsibility when he [or she]attempts to resolve it than staff concerned with other parts of the curriculum.",10
440,"He [or she]has to decide whether it is more in his pupils' interests for him to accept the existence of the present social structure and to give them help to advance within it, or for him to have rejected it, on their behalf, as stifling, competitive and exploitative and to encourage them to find fulfilment within themselves and their environment.",10
441,"It will be appreciated that these decisions within English teaching, as they are seen as likely to affect pupils' future working and leisure conditions, might be poignantly uncomfortable to resolve for working-class teachers.",10
442,"Having achieved professional status success in competitive examinations, they are likely to feel a sense of obligation to working-class pupils to equip them in a similar way.",10
443,"It is unlikely to be easy for them to decide, on their working-class pupils' behalf, that personal fulfilment derives solely from their inner selves and their environment, unrelated to questions of higher social status and improved working and leisure conditions.",10
444,"What is certain, however, is that currently English teachers are being urged by the majority of voices in their midst to concentrate upon encouragement of their pupils' creativity.",10
445,And as discussion moves on to include the other major activities within English — critical discrimination and classroom talk — it becomes clear that the central difficulties remain.,10
446,[…]There are firmly held opposite views on where the main emphases should be placed.,10
447,"The crucial question of ‘standards’, of teachers' commitment to what have traditionally been accepted as cultivated or educated taste and speech, recurs both these activities with disturbing persistence.",10
448,"(f) Changes in School Mathematics, Barry Cooper",10
449,[…,10
450,"]In the 1950s, secondary school mathematics was clearly differentiated by ‘ability’ and, to a lesser extent, by sex.",10
451,"The main boundary was between what I have termed selective and non-selective school mathematics but there was also differentiation within these, especially the latter.",10
452,"There was not, however, a one-to-one correspondence between these two subject subcultures and the selective and non-selective school sectors.",10
453,"As the 1950s passed, more and more pupils were being entered by the secondary modern schools for the GCE and, as a consequence, the most ‘able’ pupils within these schools were being brought into contact with the selective mathematics tradition.",10
454,"Broadly speaking then, at this time, two versions of mathematics were being taught to two  different categories of pupil, largely in different types of school, by teachers who, again broadly speaking, had been educated in two different types of post-school institution: the university and the teacher training college.",10
455,The latter teachers were more likely to be non-specialists.,10
456,"On this basis, it can be suggested that the two mathematical educational subcultures existed both at the level of ideas and at the level of social relations.",10
457,"The first, the selective, was a part of [the]‘public school tradition’; the second, the non-selective, of [the]‘elementary tradition’.",10
458,"It was also shown that the pedagogical perspectives held by mainstream mathematical educators, broadly ‘psychometric’, were to legitimate the broad outlines of a curriculum differentiated by ‘ability’(but not so clearly its differentiation by sex).",10
459,"A discontinuity of both content and approach existed between selective school mathematics and some currents within university mathematics, especially pure mathematics.[…]",10
460,"In the case of the Mathematical Association, many of the older school-based members will have constructed their careers existing definitions of school mathematics and […]will have had an interest, all other things being equal, in resisting changes which might be seen as leading to the relative devaluation of their ‘knowledge’.",10
461,"Some university mathematicians, on the other hand, especially those pure mathematicians teaching the post-1800 algebras, were beginning to express some concern over the nature of school mathematics.",10
462,[…]This might be seen as an expression of concern by university mathematicians about the subject socialization of their potential students.,10
463,"For several reasons, it might also have been expected, and will be seen later to have been the case, that some of the younger teachers in the higher status selective schools might become allies of those in the universities beginning to press for change.",10
464,"This would be expected because, first, they would have been socialized into a version of mathematics that of the university ‘modern’ pure mathematicians than that of their elders and because, secondly, they would have had a potential interest in changes that could, within schools, challenge the seniority of their elder colleagues or, , they would have had less of a vested interest in current practice.",10
465,"[…]By mid-1959, other pressure groups external to the schools, in the form of an alliance of university mathematicians, representing mainly the applied segment of the subject, and employers of graduate labour had also invested some of their considerable resources of time, money and status into conveying to teachers from the selective sector (who prepared their students and employees) their ‘requirements’ of the school curriculum.",10
466,They legitimized these by reference to the nation's ‘needs’ for scientific and technological manpower.[…],10
467,"More generally, it is important to stress that the active interest developed by major companies in the 1950s in mathematical and scientific education […]represented a major shift in the resources potentially available to those promoting various missions within mathematics.",10
468,"Not only was money now  possibly available, but, as a result of the conferences, ‘authoritative’ statements supporting curriculum reform had become available from an influential source.[…]",10
469,"During the same period, however, a group within the leadership of the ATAM was beginning, partly under the influence of the ICSITM, and using resources generated by developing the Association's membership in arenas relatively untapped by the Mathematical Association, to argue for the introduction of post-1800 algebraic ideas […]into school syllabuses.",10
470,"The leadership also continued to campaign for pedagogic changes, partially legitimizing both elements of its mission improving the child's ‘understanding’ of mathematics.[…]",10
471,"By mid-1959, therefore, there existed, scattered throughout the selective schools,[…]a number of teachers, partly through the associations and conferences, interested in the possibility of changing the nature of school mathematics and aware of possible sources of support for this mission.",10
472,"Others, less directly committed to change or worried how their institutions would cope with its demands, would, nevertheless, have been finding it increasingly difficult to regard school mathematics as fixed and unchangeable.[…]",10
473,"While there clearly was an ‘objective’ discontinuity of subject perspective between selective school mathematics and the practice of some segments, increasingly dominant within some countries, of university mathematics, and had been for some years, it again required interested actors, utilizing the climate of ‘crisis’resulting from the campaign on teacher supply as a major resource, to enter various arenas to persuade others of the ‘need’for change.",10
474,"Such actors, especially the university pure mathematicians, with their followers in the ATAM, and the applied mathematicians, with their industrial allies, did have considerable success in convincing school teachers of the ‘need’ for change in school practice, while fending off attacks ‘from below’on their own curricular practices.",10
475,In both cases the success of the university sub-disciplinary segments can be seen as having partly resulted from their having found allies their own organizations.,10
476,"The supporters of modern algebra within the ATAM, who had come into contact with the pure mathematicians in various European-wide meetings, Royaumont and the ICSlTM conferences, gradually made ‘modern mathematics’ more acceptable to many school teachers by combining it with those elements of their original mission concerned with Piagetian ideas, and proposing ‘intuitive’and ‘experiental’approaches to its study.",10
477,"The applied mathematicians found themselves able to claim that ‘industry’ also approved of ‘modelling’, numerical methods , being able to derive resources of personnel and money from companies with which to further the promotion of their version of ‘mathematics’.[…]",10
478,"By late 1961, therefore, the ‘need’ to reform school mathematics was seen as legitimate by actors in a number of arenas, including the industrial and  political.",10
479,"In this climate, various groups of individuals who had been involved in the conferences and activities of the preceding few years were to move into the drawing up of detailed proposals for curriculum development and the search for funds with which to implement these.[…]",10
480,"Both SMP [originating in the boys' public schools]and MME [originating in state secondary schools]produced proposals for the redefinition of school mathematics that were clearly orientated to the demands of various powerful, i.e. resource-controlling, extra-school groups.",10
481,"Hence, they might both have expected to receive considerable support from such sources.",10
482,"In fact, initially, SMP received major, and MME only minor, financial backing.",10
483,"Accounts of SMP's ‘success’ from within the subject have tended to underplay this difference, stressing instead individual and organizational factors.[…]",10
484,"SMP's ‘success’ such projects as MME must be understood, partially, the differential availability of such resources as status, academic legitimacy and finance, and not merely such factors as ‘flair’, something SMP members themselves seem to have well understood.[…]",10
485,"The very success of SMP, in ensuring its diffusion ‘downwards’, brought a curricular selection originally developed within the prestigious independent sector of the selective subculture, and only modified by teacher-writers experienced with ‘less able’ children, into contact with many teachers whose subject and pedagogical perspectives derived from within the non-selective subculture in which criteria for selecting mathematical content differed considerably.",10
486,"This, together with the dissatisfaction of members of various university disciplines and sub-disciplines ensured that SMP would be continuously criticism.",10

493,"I examined numerous texts (English, social studies, history, geography, maths and science) which were used mostly with the fourteen plus age group to locate some of the sexist trends in curriculum materials.[…]",10
494,"Social studies teachers and departments have been placed in the vanguard of progressive teaching, ostensibly because social studies is seen as a context in which individuals can develop their consciousness and understanding of society.",10
495,"Their curriculum materials, however, stand in sharp contrast to this rationale, and their texts are no less open to criticism than those of other  subjects.",10
496,There are some issues within social studies itself which are interesting.,10
497,"There is a continual debate whether the role of the social studies curriculum is to things as they are (in this case, to show a sexist world without necessarily singling, out that sexism for comment or criticism) or whether it should adopt a critical perspective.",10
498,"To my mind the answer is simple: when a critical approach is accepted as a legitimate element of social studies teaching (and surely a critical approach is not one which is to be avoided) then textbooks will be obliged to present , just describing the sexist norm and failing to evaluate it.",10
499,Social studies texts (or sections of them) fall into three categories which are crudely sexist.,10
500,1,10
501,In these texts women are relegated to a subordinate role or else portrayed through grotesque cartoons.,10
502,They also present women serving primarily a ‘decorative’ function.,10
503,2,10
504,These books do not focus on women .,10
505,3,10
506,These books treat women inadequately and are the most common genre.,10
507,"It should be stressed that since the subject of social studies is society, and particularly individuals and social groups within society, it is difficult to accept that women as a group can be of little concern to its practitioners.",10
508,"Surprisingly perhaps, while blatantly sexist material in the form of caricatures is not common, and usually used with critical intention, it is fair to say that many social studies texts produced for examination classes frequently neglected women, though there were some exceptions.",10
509,"(There are, it must be said, changes taking place at the level of examination syllabuses and question papers where the role of women appears with increasing frequency.)",10
510,"In both general texts and volumes dealing with special topics, I found that women were often invisible.",10
511,"Books about leisure, crime, courtship, education, advertising, general introductions to social studies and sociology, all showed weaknesses here.",10
512,[…]Where books were inadequate it was usually a result of their sketchy approach to a subject.,10
513,"Many books deal with women at work, perhaps focusing briefly on their dual role at work and home, or looking at housework, but not exploring to which women work and contribute to the work process.",10
514,"I am not arguing that the lack of feminist analysis makes the accounts unsatisfactory, but rather that indisputable facts are actually and half of society is virtually ignored.",10
515,"I need to emphasize two points here: firstly, most textbooks represent a misleading view of reality in which women are neglected or treated in a cursory manner and this is their ideological function.",10
516,"Secondly (and this is a more subtle and complex point), I would suggest that while some writers may believe that they are presenting reality, they are, in effect, reinforcing stereotypes and patriarchal relations.",10
517,"While we know that more men work in certain jobs, as engineers, in factories , we still need  to see and read that .",10
518,"As with so many books, social studies texts are often more reactionary and stereotyped than life itself.",10
519,"[…]So much of the curriculum is weighted males, and if such inequality is to be redressed, then curriculum materials must move towards ‘positive discrimination’ women.",10
520,"Geography, as a subject, tends to concern itself with what is done, in what manner and where, especially when it looks at industry and resources.",10
521,"Its focus is not so much on the individuals who work and produce as on the production process, and this rather impersonal and abstract approach makes it difficult or even unnecessary to look for any exclusion of women, although this occurs.",10
522,", a text which adopts a general, objective style can often create the wrong impression through its use of the pseudo-generic ‘man’.",10
523,"Although the written text may be very general and refrain from referring either to men or women, the illustrations make a definite point for the majority contain male figures.",10
524,Where women are illustrated the results are often less than desirable for they frequently seem to be included for their decorative or ‘selling’ power.,10
525,Among the geography texts I examined there were two particular sexist tendencies.,10
526,"The first was the invisibility of women who were ignored, or under-represented.",10
527,", in Third World countries women play a crucial role in farming but this was certainly not the impression which would be gained from the books.",10
528,The second tendency is the desire to simplify (or avoid) any analysis (a rather ironical position) which makes distortion almost unavoidable.,10
529,Examples of this were discussions of population growth which made no mention of birth control and figures on the distribution of the sexes through occupations which were offered without explanation or analysis.[…],10
530,History textbooks also provide interesting documentation for even among highly qualified history scholars the centrality of women in history is not yet accepted.,10
531,"Since school texts so frequently seem to depend upon the received knowledge of one intellectual generation before them, children will be condemned for some time to reading about the exploits of men.",10
532,History as an intellectual discipline now includes social history which looks at how people actually lived within the limitations of the economic and political events.,10
533,Labour history too has developed into a recognizable historical research area and women's history is following suit.,10
534,These approaches have a preoccupation with the activities of ordinary people with important figures and are concerned with providing an alternative perspective on our past.,10
535,"Women's history has yet to take root within our universities and so must wait even longer before it makes an impact in the classroom despite the availability of many histories of women produced in the last decade or so, which could provide starting points for a better balanced approach to history.",10
536,More social history is being taught but examination syllabuses still focus on political and economic history which conventionally excludes women.,10
537,I looked at several texts directed at the upper half of secondary schools and  roughly the same categories emerged as for social studies.,10
538,Typical was a view of the past which left women invisible.,10
539,A book on the First World War made no mention of women's contribution to the war effort at home or abroad.,10
540,A book on Britain since 1700 ignored the nineteenth-century feminists and the birth control movement; books on political and economic history were almost exclusively about men.,10
541,"There was even a chapter in one book entitled ‘The Home’ in which the focus was on the man, portrayed relaxing after some ‘Do-it-Yourself work.",10
542,There are modern history books which ostensibly focus on periods of great social change but the reader could be forgiven for reaching the conclusion that there have been no social changes which have involved/ affected women.,10
543,"There are, , history books, or rather sections and chapters in books, which do focus on women.",10
544,"Generally these are inadequate, non-analytical and sometimes almost caricatured.",10
545,Historians’ treatments of the suffrage movement are a case in point: the coverage is frequently brief and uninformative.,10
546,"Sometimes discussion which starts well descends into trivia, a discussion of women's part in the labour market in the twentieth century which ends in an uninspired discussion of fashion.",10
547,I also noticed a tendency to assume that by the twentieth century women had overcome most of the problems of inequality.,10
548,Mention is made of the Equal Pay and Sex Discrimination Acts but there is no attempt to question their ultimate effectiveness.,10
549,"One book included a comment that Hitler had a ‘mystical appeal’ to women, but fails to discuss why or how, and suggests that Hitler's views on the home as women's place seem old-fashioned to us today, something unfortunately far from the case.",10
550,Another book claimed that by the end of the First World War much of the old prejudice against women having an equal place with men in society had gone.,10
551,"I found, too, an assertion that fashion today is a sign that women's emancipation is well underway — a claim that cannot go unchallenged.",10
552,"The lack of feminist perspective is emphasized by statements : ‘There can be no doubt that women and girls have failed to make full use of the opportunity now open to them’, which implies an ideologically and materially unfettered equality of opportunity.",10
553,"Another historian notes that women have not come to rival men, despite the equality established through legislation (!), but needs to add a critique of such legislation and society if he is to understand its failures.",10
554,"What is required in history, if girls are to have equal opportunity with boys in school, is both a full investigation and exposure of women's past — recorded and documented in special women's history books —an integration of women and their contribution to history within existing accounts.",10
555,This means studying the women who were great and important (‘heroine history’) the ordinary women.,10
556,The two sexes are not experiencing equal educational opportunity while the only version of the past they are presented with looks almost exclusively at males and has been recorded almost exclusively by males.,10
557,"Science and mathematics, their subject matter, necessitate the  adoption of a different approach.",10
558,"This is not the place to explore arguments which characterize the scientific mode of thought as in some sense masculine (though this may have a vital role to play in our understanding of the science of our culture if it is so: see Kelly .,",10
559,1979).,10
560,"I intend to analyse the sexism in such texts on a more immediate, if mundane, level.",10
561,Questions which can be posed include: what impression do we get of the ‘mathematical world’ and way of thinking; what does maths connect with; who might it concern; who are these books directed at?,10
562,(The same questions could also apply to chemistry and physics.),10
563,Sensible of the fact that maths is not a popular subject among children there is often an attempt to show how the ‘everyday’ can be viewed mathematically.,10
564,"However, the ‘everyday’, these texts, is a world of football, cricket, men driving cars and traditional boys' hobbies whether the topic is statistics, measurement or velocity.",10
565,The world of maths is male and this is reinforced in several books by the number of questions which revolve around men and boys doing things susceptible to mathematical calculation.,10
566,"Occasional gestures towards the girls being included in maths are made, typically, via a girl sipping tea or standing decoratively posed in a mini skirt in a phone booth.",10
567,"The School Mathematics Project books are more abstract than many, depending less on pictures.",10
568,But even in these boys feature more through their visibility in the questions and examples.,10
569,A supreme example of sexist attitude can be found in the early pages of one SMP volume demonstrating the use of flow diagrams (Book F; 4–5).,10
570,"A flow diagram discriminates between girls and boys, directing the girls to consider a flow chart dealing with a knitting process, while the boys are to examine a flow chart of a cement mixing operation.",10
571,"The two sexes are told exactly what they should be interested in, and all in the name of mathematics.",10
572,"It would be a short sighted solution to try to remedy this bias by showing mathematics operating in the domestic realm to the same extent as it operates outside it, just to draw girls' interest.",10
573,"The main point is that examples could be , these books make them .",10
574,No attempt is made in any of the books I looked at to integrate girls into the world of engineering or technology.,10
575,Chemistry and physics books revealed the same patterns.,10
576,"The male predominates in the pictures, examples and the questions.",10
577,One very lively looking book provides typical examples of the features I would criticize: a focus on the history of the science dealing with the main discoverers who all seem to be men; a use of the pseudo-generic ‘man’ and ‘he’when the reference is to men and women; more pictures of men than women; a series of cartoons in the margins which portray boys more frequently than girls to illustrate some concept or show active participation in scientific experiment.,10
578,But we should note that the process of deterring girls from science begins well before they enter secondary school.,10
579,It takes the form partly of encouraging them to relate to the personal and subjective while boys begin to grapple with the impersonal and objective.,10
580,"Our school textbooks present a biased, distorted and sometimes explicitly sexist view of the world and there is no doubt that they could be improved.",10
581,THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK,10
582,Introduction,10
583,"As the last extracts indicate, schools and teaching exist in a social framework.",10
584,That framework shapes the broad conditions in which they operate and more specifically lays down both what is expected of them and under what circumstances and with what resources they go about achieving those goals.,10
585,Those are the kinds of broader social issues raised in the articles in this Section of the Reader.,10
586,"A good example of the changing social framework within which schools exist, and, equally important, an exposition of the background to one of the key contemporary issues, is Ali Rattansi's ‘Race, Education and British Society’.",10
587,"This traces the black presence in Britain and its historical and present outcomes, with special attention to current debates on so-called ‘black underachievement’.",10
588,The broad social framework underlies the specific problems which education policy attempts to tackle.,10
589,"While specific expectations of education vary, they tend to do so around three key expectations, that the education service will support the national economy, make good citizens and enable young people to make the most of their various talents.",10
590,"A moment's thought, however, demonstrates that these three main aims are not necessarily mutually complementary; they could even be mutually contradictory.",10
591,"At any rate, it seems difficult for them all to be given equal emphasis all the time.",10
592,In recent years we have been witnessing an attempt to place more emphasis on the first two purposes of education to redress what is considered an imbalance the third in the three decades following the 1944 Education Act.,10
593,"Now the explicit policy aim for schools is much more a directly vocational one, and the article by Moore traces out some of the connections between education, qualifications and the labour markets young people are seeking to enter.",10
594,Not all of his conclusions are what might be expected given the current stress on the importance of vocational education and training.,10
595,"Another contemporary issue, though in this case an old one taking on a new form, is the provision of more equal educational opportunities for girls, and for young people from ethnic minorities.",10
596,"We have already alluded to this problem in the General Introduction, and the paper by Williams amplifies and develops the issue.",10
597,She looks at national and local policies for mitigating the educational effects of gender and ethnic differences.,10
598,"She shows that these are very distinct sets of problems, which have received very distinct sets of answers, with rather different implications for teachers.",10
599,"Moving from what is expected of the education system, the next three  articles look at aspects of the circumstances in which schools attempt to meet these aims.",10
600,"The paper by Fitz, Edwards and Whitty examines the philosophy and operation of the Assisted Places Scheme.",10
601,"This not only reminds us of the existence of a non-state section of education (which as we write in mid-1987 seems set only to increase in size), but also in drawing attention to the relations between the state and non-state sectors, points out features of the conditions under which the former operates that are frequently taken for granted.",10
602,"One aspect of this operation over which state schools, at any rate, have minimal control is the pupils who come to them.",10
603,"These pupils are shaped by many other factors than their schooling, and the extract from Coleman's considers some of the main features influencing adolescent development and their relation to school.",10
604,Another factor affecting the way schools work is the way they have always worked.,10
605,"There are certain fundamental, seemingly inevitable, features of schooling in this society which persist, changing aims and resources for education.",10
606,Features like these are best located through comparative or historical analysis and Brian Simon's ‘Why No Pedagogy in England?’ provides both.,10
607,It also provides valuable substance on the nature of teaching methods and their relationship to psychological theory to the overall aims for education.,10
608,One of the most dramatically changing aspects of the context and content of education recently has been the expectations and especially the control of teacher's work.,10
609,This appears very likely to culminate in some form of official appraisal of their work.,10
610,The process leading this and its likely consequences for teaching are discussed in detail in the article by Walsh.,10
611,A central question addressed in this section is ‘what is schooling for?’,10
612,"We have already considered the varying aims for schooling, and the circumstances under which it is carried out.",10
613,"One major aspect of the question which often gets overlooked, however, is not so much the outcomes of schooling for young people qualifications, etc., but what part it plays in their overall development into adulthood.",10
614,"Much of what is written about education seems to assume, with the best possible motives, that only what they get from their schooling, influences, or can ‘make’ or ‘save’, young people.",10
615,"The extract from Clarke and Willis takes a different view, arguing for multiple transitions from youth to adulthood, and examining the place of schooling in that process, especially for working-class young people.",10
616,"Finally, we have thought it worthwhile to reprint, yet again, Basil Bernstein's classic, ‘Education Cannot Compensate for Society’.",10
617,"Although not far short of 30 years old, written in social and educational circumstances far different from those that prevail now, and specific problems that have a major place on the agenda for schooling, its basic message remains inspirational.",10
618,"‘Race’, Education and British Society",10
619,Ali Rattansi,10
620,The purpose of this chapter is to provide some part of the conceptual clarification and social and historical background that is essential to an analysis of the nature of ‘race’ as an element in British education and society.,10
621,"Teachers and other educationalists cannot be expected to come to an adequate understanding of recent trends in multicultural and anti-racist education, nor can they develop an independent critical judgement on recent controversies in this area, without some grasp of the deeper structural and ideological issues that  the racial dimension in education, politics and the economy.",10
622,Cultural Diversity in Society and Education,10
623,The immediate context for the discussion of ‘race’ in British education is provided by the development of the multicultural and anti-racist educational movement in recent years.’,10
624,"However, although ‘multiculturalism, as an educational movement dates from the 1970s and is primarily a response to the post-Second World War migration of black communities to Britain, it is important to recognize that multiculturalism is a perennial issue, for all but the simplest of societies are characterized by cultural diversity.",10
625,"It could be argued, therefore, that good education ought always to be based on multi-cultural principles.",10
626,Cultural diversity is a central feature of modern British society.,10
627,"It has long been recognized that a variety of structural divisions have generated more or less distinct cultures and sub-cultures, whether based on class divisions, age, gender or religion.",10
628,"Moreover, British society has been characterized by significant ‘sub-national’ cultures — Scottish, Welsh, Irish — which are interwoven with linguistic and religious differences.",10
629,"Taken together, these forms of differentiation have produced a highly complex pattern of cultural diversity, although the existence of this cultural pluralism must not be taken to imply a basic equality of power and influence between the various groups.",10
630,"On the contrary, many of the cultures and their interrelationships are deeply  marked by relations of discrimination and subordination stemming from structural inequalities.",10
631,"This is most obvious in the case of social class-based cultures, but the more recent resurgence of Scottish and Welsh nationalism and the ‘troubles’ in Northern Ireland have underlined that the dynamics of regional and ‘sub-national’cultures in Britain also need to be understood in the context of material inequalities and patterns of cultural domination, subordination and conflict.",10
632,This is a point that becomes even more acutely relevant when considering the relation between black and white cultures in modern Britain.,10
633,"The cultural diversity of British society has, , been much enriched by successive waves of migration into the country.",10
634,"Earlier British history is characterized by settlement and conquest by a wide variety of foreign groups, including the Romans, Vikings and Normans.",10
635,"In the Middle Ages Jews, Flemings and Italians were prominent in the economic life of the country.",10
636,"The nineteenth and early twentieth centuries saw the arrival, of amongst others, the Irish, especially in the 1840s during the great famine (Walvin, 1984, pp. 48–60; Miles, 1982, pp. 120 — 50) and Eastern European Jews, fleeing from racist persecution in the period from 1880s to the First World War (Walvin, 1984, pp. 61–677).",10
637,The Origins and Early Development of the Black Presence in Britain,10
638,"Many of the features which characterize the formation of the British nation are generally known, although until recently there has been a widespread failure to draw the necessary conclusions about the heterogeneity of cultures in British society and the real complexity of British ‘national identity’.",10
639,"There is, however, considerable ignorance about the deep historical roots of the black presence in Britain, using the term black here to refer to African, Afro-Caribbean and South Asian communities.",10
640,"Although references to the presence of black people are available from the Roman period onward, especially in the early sixteenth century, the most famous of the early documented references is the arrival in 1555 of a group of five Africans, brought here by a merchant to be taught English they could return to Africa to act as interpreters for British traders.",10
641,"The significance of the date is well underlined by Fryer in his magnificent history of black people in Britain: ‘It was the summer of 1555 — before we had potatoes, or tobacco, or tea, and nine years before Shakespeare was born’(1984, p. 5).",10
642,"It was in the second half of the eighteenth century that the presence of black people in Britain began to give rise to recognizable black communities, with a total black population of probably around 10,000, although some historians have produced even higher estimates.",10
643,"The black people of London were particularly well-organized, meeting together regularly at clubs for musical events and celebrating christenings and weddings.",10
644,"Scores of black people played a prominent part in British public life in the nineteenth century, often as members of radical organizations and participants in some of the major political events of the times.",10
645,"One of the better known is William Cufay, an important figure in the Chartist movement who was exiled to Tasmania in 1849.",10
646,"Another is Mary Seacole, the Jamaican-born nurse whose extraordinary abilities and dedication in caring for the wounded and sick during the Crimean war won her a reputation, at the time, equal to that of Florence Nightingale but who was soon forgotten, until the more recent attempts at reconstructing the history of the black presence in Britain.",10
647,"The nineteenth century witnessed too a growing Asian presence in Britain, developing from earlier groups of servants, sailors and traders, and several Asians were also prominent in British politics, the most famous being Bombay-born Dadabhai Naoroji who, championing the Indian cause in London, also entered the House of Commons after winning Finsbury Central for the Liberals in 1892 and supported women's suffrage, trade union rights and Home Rule for Ireland (Visram, 1986, pp. 78–92).",10
648,"Racism, Slavery and Imperial Domination",10
649,Black people found themselves on the receiving end of racism in all manner of forms from the beginning of their arrival in Britain.,10
650,"Queen Elizabeth I, her penchant for black servants and entertainers notwithstanding, took the opportunity to ‘scapegoat’ the black communities, and attempted to expel them without compunction when there appeared to be political advantage in doing so for managing her economic difficulties.",10
651,"Even at this early stage of contact between white and black in Britain, it is clear that she would have been building on already existing racial caricature and prejudice creating an artificial tide of hostility against black people.",10
652,"For one thing, the negative associations of blackness with impurity, evil, misery and dirt had already become established in the English language, partly through the colour symbolism of Christian doctrine (James, 1981; Dabydeen, 1985a).",10
653,"Travellers' tales, especially from traders, had begun to circulate fictitious images of African peoples with bizarre physical features (no mouths or noses!); accounts of the supposed promiscuity and general beastly immorality of African societies mingled with more accurate descriptions of the wealth and refinement to be found on the continent (Walvin, 1973; Jordan, 1974; Husband, 1982).",10
654,"Britain's growing involvement in the highly profitable slave trade from the middle of the seventeenth century gave further impetus to the spread of racist caricatures and subsequently to the developments of the more systematic racial classifications and doctrines of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, which added a pseudo-scientific legitimation to earlier myths (Banton and Harwood, 1975).",10
655,"The significance of these beliefs in creating a commonsense culture of taken-for-granted racism in Britain is difficult to underestimate, although widespread illiteracy may well have protected the subordinate  classes from the level of immersion in racism experienced by the upper classes who were fed a growing diet of racist mythology in fiction, newspapers and missionary tracts (Lorimer, 1978; Miles, 1982, pp. 118–19).",10
656,"However, the significance of the slave trade, and subsequently the establishment of British colonies in the Caribbean and the imperial domination of India, lay not merely in their ideological impact on the growth of racism at home, but also, and some would argue more importantly, in their economic impact on Africa, the Caribbean, India and Britain.",10
657,"Slavery and imperial domination have been crucial social forces in the emergence of a modern world order, characterized by the striking inequalities which provide the essential backdrop to an understanding of the post-Second World War migrations of black communities to Britain, and which continue to generate migratory pressures on peoples from the Third World.",10
658,"To put it slightly differently, it is important to understand that the poverty of the Third World and the wealth of the West are the outcome of an interlinked process in which the rapid and massive growth in Western prosperity has occurred and continues to do so at the expense and underdevelopment of the Third World.",10
659,"Consider, first, the impact of slavery on Africa.",10
660,"It has to be remembered that the arrival of European traders of any kind the African continent had a large number of flourishing economies and civilizations which had food surpluses, extensive trade networks, cities, complex technologies and craft products, and elaborate political systems (Davidson, 1974, pp. 67–174).",10
661,"Over a period of some three centuries, the European slave trade deprived these societies of anywhere between 15 and 60 million people — exact figures are inevitably difficult to calculate.",10
662,"Some of these died in captivity while being brought to the coast from the African homeland, and even more lost their lives in the brutal conditions the slave ships during the notorious Atlantic crossing or ‘Middle Passage’.",10
663,"One recent estimate suggests that of the scores of millions that Africa lost, some ten million survived to undertake forced labour and to endure dehumanizing captivity in the Caribbean and African plantations (Curtin, 1969).",10
664,For some of the societies of West and Central Africa the loss of such large numbers of able-bodied young men and women was catastrophic in several respects.,10
665,"First, there was the simple fact of depopulation which diminished the general size of the market and the level of demand for indigenous manufactures, and thereby arrested the economic development of the whole region; second, the depopulation affected agriculture, reducing some previous food exporting regions to starvation levels by the nineteenth century; third, African production of cloth, metalware and other handicrafts was severely affected, not only by the loss of so many of its producers, but also by the fact that in return the slave traders penetrated the markets of the coast and hinterland with European cotton and manufactured goods; and fourth, as the demand for slaves multiplied and as many African kings and merchants became even more dependent on European trade, war raids for the capture of potential slaves from neighbouring societies became even more frequent, injecting political instability, consuming precious economic resources, and creating a vicious spiral in which rival kingdoms became ever more dependent on the slave trade to acquire the fire arms necessary for capturing more slaves and in turn defending their slaves against slave-hunting raids from neighbouring kingdoms (Rodney, 1972, pp. 104–23; Davidson, 1974, pp. 206 — 10; Inikoria, 1982).",10
666,"The ties of dependence that originated during the period of slavery became even more extensive in the period of the formal colonization of Africa, and after dependence too, creating economies substantially dependent on a limited range of cash crops and raw materials required by the metropolitan economies which retained control over major sectors of production, pricing and the flow of profits (Brett, 1973; Leys, 1975; Howard, 1978; Rodney, 1972; Davidson, 1974).",10
667,"A major destination for African slaves was the Caribbean islands where British settlers had begun to generate a huge demand for forced labour on sugar, cotton, coffee and tobacco plantations.",10
668,"The form of slave production and exploitation and subsequent colonial development of the West Indies has also ensured for most of the islands a fate similar to that of many modern African states: a form of ‘peripheral’ development in which individual economies are dominated by a very small number of cash crops, often the same as those cultivated under the original system of slavery, the income from which is dependent on world commodity prices considerable fluctuation and open to manipulation by metropolitan powers (Beckford, 1972).",10
669,"A fuller understanding of the international economic order and modern migratory pressures also requires an analysis, inevitably a very brief one in the present context, of the British impact on the Indian states that came to form one of the centrepieces of the British Empire and the so-called ‘jewel in the crown’.",10
670,British colonial policies offered both food and industrial production.,10
671,"A rapacious British land taxation policy was partly responsible for a series of famines in Bengal in the second half of the eighteenth century, while elsewhere in India the staple foods of the poor millet and pulses were displaced by the production for export of grains and commercial crops (Bagchi, 1982, pp. 79, 84, 86).",10
672,"The process of de-industrialization in India under colonial rule began with the deliberate destruction of the cotton manufacturing industry and the opening up of Indian markets to British cotton manufacturers; from a net exporter, India was reduced to a major importer of cotton manufactures, most of these from Britain, and indeed India was forced to become the single largest importer of British cotton manufactures, sometimes taking as much as 40 of British exports.",10
673,"A variety of other industries were also ruined by British policy: silk goods manufacturers, , were compelled to restrict themselves to the production of raw silk, while gun making was seriously affected by a restrictive licensing policy and other means (Bagchi, 1982, p. 82).",10
674,"Economic development in India was also thwarted, as in other colonies, by forms of racist discrimination which excluded locals from engaging in entrepreneurial activity.",10
675,"Even the railway  system constructed under British rule can now be seen to have had an ambiguous role the Indian economy, for its benefits have to be set against its encouragement of export-based production and its role in opening up India to the inflow of manufactures, mainly from Britain (Bagchi, 1982, pp. 85-.6).",10
676,"However, while slavery and colonialism contributed to the ‘underdevelopment’ of Africa, the Caribbean and India — and similar processes were at work in other colonies, often under other colonial powers, although not in the white Dominions of Australia, New Zealand and Canada — Britain obtained significant economic benefits from its imperial domination.",10
677,"To continue with the example of India, it is well documented that there was a massive economic ‘drain' which transferred substantial export surpluses of goods and bullion to Britain.",10
678,"For the period 1757–1822 it has been calculated that the aggregate drain was approximately £250 million, while it has been pointed out that for the period from the 1850s to the First World War surpluses from the Indian economy were crucial in allowing Britain to balance its deficits with Europe and the USA (Bagchi, 1982, pp. 81, 88).",10
679,"The Indian economy was made to contribute heavily during the First World War, including a gift payment of £100 million.",10
680,"The fortunes made slavery and the allied triangular trade in sugar, tobacco, cotton and other commodities produced in the Caribbean islands and America also played an important part in British economic development.",10
681,The enormous growth and prosperity of both Bristol and Liverpool in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were almost wholly the slave trade.,10
682,"Some indication of the fortunes made slaves, sugar and cotton can be obtained from the size of estates of the traders in Bristol and Liverpool and London.",10
683,"In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries those who had climbed to prosperity on the back of the slave trade were regularly leaving property and assets worth anything between £16,000 and £1 million.",10
684,"They began to acquire for themselves important political positions, especially in Parliament, and the ‘West India lobby’ became a powerful political force (Fryer, 1984, pp. 40–50).",10
685,", the fortunes were not spent or invested in the Caribbean.",10
686,Instead they funded the rapid development of Britain into a major industrial economy and formidable international power.,10
687,"A substantial portion of the surpluses generated slave labour and the trade in cotton, sugar and tobacco was channelled into banking operations and undoubtedly provided one important element in the emergence of Britain's banking system, with most of the major banking corporations of today tracing some part of their profits to earlier banks set up with finds derived from the triangular trade (Fryer, 1984, pp. 40ff).",10
688,The exact significance for Britain's economic development of the surpluses generated the triangular trade and Britain's imperial domination of India and Africa will continue to be debated.,10
689,"However, although it is very likely that the British industrial revolution would have occurred without these funds, it is difficult to imagine that Britain would have achieved the kind  of scale and pace of industrial development that it did without access to these funds and to the markets provided by the colonies.",10
690,"In turn, as pointed out earlier, British domination contributed to the underdevelopment of the colonies by the drain of surpluses, destruction of indigenous industries, and other means.",10
691,"Again, the precise effects of British imperial domination are inevitably matters of dispute (Kumar and Desai, 1983) and it is important to emphasize that the claim here is that the level of present development of the regions of the Third World in question is simply the outcome of their colonial experience, but that it is difficult to understand the nature of this underdevelopment and the continuing exploitation of these countries within the international economic order without a grasp of the imperial impact.",10
692,"In other words, without it one cannot explain why at the present time there is a maldistribution of world wealth and income the countries of the Northern hemisphere contain only 25 of the world's population but obtain 80 of the world's income, while the countries of the South contain 75 of the world's population but obtain only 20 of the world's income.",10
693,"This profound asymmetry in the structure and evolution of the world economic system provides the essential background to the more recent migrations of black communities to Britain in the post-Second World War period, for one of its main effects has been the creation of pools of under- and unemployed workers in circumstances of poverty and restricted opportunity in the Third World, who find themselves having to undergo the painful dislocation entailed by migration and travel thousands of miles work.",10
694,The Post-War Migrations to Britain,10
695,"Poverty and restricted opportunities for employment as a result of under-development are usually regarded as so-called ‘push’ factors in the explanation of patterns of emigration from less developed countries, and in the case of the Indian sub-continent and the Caribbean Islands have operated powerfully throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in compelling sections of their populations to find work abroad, very often servicing the economic and military needs of the British Empire.",10
696,"The Indian presence in far flung outposts of the Empire, , from Malaysia to East Africa, can only be understood in this context, and it is important to note that a tradition of emigration from Jamaica had already developed in the nineteenth century, with 2,000 Jamaicans migrating to build railways in Panama, followed by well over 80,000 who went to work on the first attempt at constructing the Panama Canal in the 1880s.",10
697,"As the above examples illustrate, migration depends not merely on ‘push’ factors poverty and unemployment, but also the ‘pull’factors of employment opportunities in other regions or countries, coupled with favourable political climates and legal frameworks which enable and encourage  movement.",10
698,These ‘pull’ factors operated with particular force in the post-Second World War period as many of the European countries began to reconstruct and expand their economies at a rapid rate and found themselves suffering acute labour shortages which could only be relieved by the employment of foreign workers.,10
699,"Labour shortages, especially in iron foundries, textiles, vehicle production, construction and food processing; in service industries, transport, catering and hotels; and in the state sector, in the growing National Health Service, provide the essential backdrop to the increase in black immigration to Britain in the post-war period.",10
700,"Moreover, in all these sectors, shortages were particularly experienced in jobs involving unskilled and semi-skilled work, low pay, shift working, unsocial hours and unpleasant working conditions (Smith, 1977, pp. 64–81).",10
701,"Initially, an attempt was made to fill the labour shortages by allowing over 100,000 Poles to stay on in Britain and by encouraging immigration from other European countries, but soon it was felt necessary to look to other sources of cheap labour, and immigration from the Caribbean and the Indian sub-continent was encouraged.",10
702,"Indeed, organizations London Transport, the British Hotel and Restaurants Association and the National Health Service directly recruited workers in the Caribbean, although most black immigration to Britain during this period was not planned and regulated in this manner.",10
703,"Nevertheless, there was a very close relationship between employment opportunities and trends of immigration, especially from the Caribbean; Ceri Peach's research demonstrates that throughout the 1950s periods of economic expansion led to a rise in immigration while periods of recession led to a decline (Peach, 1968).",10
704,"Immigration to Britain from India and Pakistan has followed a slightly different pattern, with the real increase coming in the early 1960s, and later the threat of the immigration controls that were eventually enshrined in a series of Immigration Acts, beginning with the 1962 Act (Robinson, 1986).",10
705,Immigration patterns have been substantially affected by the Acts.,10
706,"While before 1962 most immigration into Britain consisted of men, temporarily migrant and unaccompanied by families, the post-1962 period has been one of permanent settlement with workers and their families (Braham, 1985, p. 112).",10
707,"The irony has often been noted that the imposition of legislature controls actually resulted in a dramatic increase in immigration from the Caribbean and the Indian sub-continent, as people attempted to beat the ban, this severed the previously close connections between employment opportunities and migration to Britain.",10
708,Black immigration into Britain in the post-war period should be seen in the context of overall patterns of migration the United Kingdom.,10
709,", it is important to remember that for every year from 1966 to 1983, only two years, 1979 and 1983, were characterized by immigration; in all other years more people left Britain than entered (Gordon and Klug, 1985, p. 22).",10
710,As a result of the various Immigration Acts there is now virtually no  ‘primary’ immigration from the New Commonwealth; most settlement comes from the close relations and dependents of those already resident in Britain (ibid.).,10
711,"There are now about 2.4 million black people in the UK, comprising 4.3 of the total population.",10
712,"Over 40 of these are born in the UK (Gordon and Newnham, 1986, p. 6) and a very substantial proportion of Asian and Afro-Caribbean children in British schools are now British born.",10
713,"Thus it makes little sense to refer to ‘immigrant’ communities; what we now have are minority black British communities, that have already made a very substantial contribution to the growth and prosperity of the British economy.",10
714,The Post-War Economic Boom: the Contribution of Migrant Labour,10
715,"It cannot be doubted that the post-war black migrations have been of considerable economic benefit to Britain, just as the migrations from North Africa, Turkey, Greece and Italy have boosted the economies of Western Europe.",10
716,Several economic advantages can be identified.,10
717,"First, black workers were recruited for precisely those jobs, usually poorly paid and involving unpleasant working conditions, which the indigenous white working class was able to reject at the time of economic expansion, thus preventing the development of bottlenecks in production and permitting higher levels of capital accumulation.",10
718,"Second, several surveys have concluded that the importation of foreign labour was an important factor in constraining wages and controlling inflation (Castles, Booth and Wallace, 1984, pp. 27–8).",10
719,"Other economic benefits of migrant labour include the recruitment of migrants to particular jobs at lower wages than indigenous workers, partly because job titles and grades could be invented to cover up the fact that job content remained the same, and also the threat of repatriation and other forms of intimidation; the enhanced possibilities for the introduction of shiftwork and piece-work, deskilling, and the slower introduction of safety measures; the avoidance of national insurance payments by the recruitment of illegal migrants; and the ability to shed and recruit with relative ease, thus avoiding the costs of labour hoarding (Paine, 1977; Fevre, 1983).",10
720,"The recruitment of migrant labour has also had what one might refer to as a series of indirect benefits, especially in the earlier phase of immigration, because Britain and the other importing countries were able to avoid the costs involved in actually producing the immigrant labour power, from the birth to the maturation of the workers concerned, and the lower demands on the welfare state of economically active, healthy, single, young men and women who nevertheless paid the same rate of taxation as other workers (Gorz, 1970).",10
721,"Racism, Power and Inequality",10
722,The previous discussion has emphasized that black workers were recruited for particular types of jobs in specific sectors of the British economy.,10
723,This has also produced very distinctive geographical concentrations of black communities in Britain specific locations within the urban conurbations where they have settled.,10
724,"And it is crucial to recognize that widespread racial discrimination has been an important factor in reproducing these patterns of employment and settlement and, as we shall see, also has a significant role in explanations of levels of achievement by black pupils in British schools.",10
725,"High levels of direct racial discrimination in employment have been repeatedly demonstrated by national and local studies, both at the level of initial recruitment and promotion.",10
726,"The most recent studies suggest that more than a third of employers discriminate against black applicants for jobs, and that levels of discrimination are the same for Asian and Afro-Caribbean applicants, for men and women, and vary little between job categories, although previous studies have documented higher levels of racial discrimination unskilled manual jobs (Brown and Gay, 1985; Smith, 1977).",10
727,"The latest report on the employment of black graduates also concludes that they experience greater difficulties than white graduates in obtaining employment; , the jobs obtained appear to be inferior to those gained by white graduates (CRE, 1987).",10
728,Given the original form of recruitment of black workers and the operation of racial discrimination it is not surprising that a much larger proportion of black employees are manual workers than the white population in Britain.,10
729,"A recent Policy Studies Institute investigation reveals that while 83 of Afro-Caribbean men and 73 of Asian men are manual workers, the proportion of white male manual workers is 58 .",10
730,"Also, larger proportions of Afro-Caribbean and Asian manual workers are in unskilled and semi-skilled work, and larger proportions than white manual workers engage in shift work.",10
731,"Moreover, while 5 of Afro-Caribbean men and 13 of Asian men are in professional and managerial occupations, 19 of white males are in such jobs; but it is important to note that the ‘Asian’ category conceals significant material differences, with 25 of African Asians being in the professions and managerial employment, and nearly 70 of Bangladeshi workers occupying semi-skilled or unskilled jobs (Brown, 1984).",10
732,"For women workers there is a different pattern: 47 of Afro-Caribbean women and 52 of Asian women are manual workers, while 37 of white women are manual workers; and 1 of Afro-Caribbean women as compared to 6 Asian and 7 of white women are in professional and managerial occupations.",10
733,"The largest proportions of all women are either in low-level non-manual work or in semi-skilled manual work (Brown, 1984).",10
734,"Moreover, as Gordon and Newnham (1986) recently emphasized, ‘Black  people who do find jobs consistently earn less than white people and are in lower level jobs, differences in qualifications, work experience and language difficulties are taken into account.",10
735,These differences can therefore only be explained by racial discrimination’(p. 16).,10
736,"Black youth has also experienced high levels of racial discrimination when applying for work or training (Troyna and Smith, 1983).",10
737,"An investigation into the Youth Training Scheme, , points out that a much smaller proportion of young black people were obtaining places on the Mode A schemes, which offered better chances of permanent employment, and in larger proportions found themselves placed in Mode B schemes, with worse prospects (CRE, 1984).",10
738,Given the well-documented existence of widespread discrimination against black job-seekers it is hardly surprising that levels of unemployment within the black communities are substantially higher than those for white people.,10
739,"In 1984 the unemployment rate for the latter was 10.6 , but it was 23 for Afro-Caribbeans, 34.6 for people of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin, and 15.2 for those of Indian origin.",10
740,"Black youth suffers particularly high levels of unemployment: in 1983, , when unemployment rates for white young people were 30 for men and 23 for women, the levels were 46 and 50 respectively for Afro-Caribbeans and 35 and 47 respectively for Asians.",10
741,"As many as 65 of Afro-Caribbean youth in Handsworth, Birmingham, were unemployed in 1985 (Newnham, 1986).",10
742,"Although much of the racism that black job-seekers experience is of a direct and overt kind, it is important to recognize that a variety of indirect forms of discrimination also operates against black people in the search for employment, ranging from common employers' practices like recruiting relatives and children of existing workers to the operation of particular conceptions of the ‘good’ worker which militate against the employment of workers thought to be different in manner or appearance (Lee and Wrench, 1983; Blackburn and Mann, 1979; Jenkins, 1986).",10
743,"Moreover, research in this context has demonstrated the existence of misleading stereotypes of the abilities of black workers, with images that are often contradictory employers, and which reflect a willingness to generalize about ethnic characteristic on the basis of very limited experience (Lee and Wrench, 1983; Jenkins, 1986).",10
744,"The racism which manifests itself in employment is only one, albeit crucial, part of the general experience of discrimination and subordination that black people have had to confront in Britain.",10
745,"In an introductory discussion of the kind undertaken in this chapter it is simply not possible to discuss comprehensively the various forms, spheres and agencies of racism that operate in British society, , those deriving from the state's implementation of increasingly tighter immigration controls nationality legislation, or We activities of some sections of the police (Dummett, 1982; Gordon and Klug, 1985; Benyon, 1986).",10
746,"Moreover, there is the extremely serious issue of  and physical violence directed against black communities which  in some urban areas takes places on a routine basis with highly distressing and in some cases fatal consequences (CRE, 1979; Home Office, 1981; CRE, 1981; Klug, 1982).",10
747,"However, the question of housing does require more extended treatment, both for its centrality as a material resource in the pattern of life chances of black people and for its possible role in understanding black pupils' achievements in British schools.",10
748,Widespread racial discrimination against black people in the availability and allocation of housing has been extensively discussed in a range of surveys and investigations.,10
749,"In the private sector a large number of estate agents, landlords, accommodation agencies and building societies have been found to operate discriminatory registers, refusing to let or sell or lend to black individuals and families, while direct and indirect discrimination in many local authority housing departments has led to black tenants being allocated inferior council housing (Gordon and Newnham, 1986).",10
750,"For all forms of tenure, black families are more likely to be in property that is older, more crowded and in areas that are likely to suffer from a variety of disadvantages environmental and other conditions (Brown, 1984, pp. 66–127).",10
751,"There is evidence that the high incidence of unemployment amongst black people will make housing conditions, especially overcrowding, worse as young unemployed people are finding it difficult to move out after marriage and set up their own homes (Brah, 1986).",10
752,Sociologists have often pointed out that the various processes and outcomes of racial discrimination referred to above have produced a very distinctive location for black people in the British class structure.,10
753,"Rex, , has argued that most black people form an underclass in British society, occupying the most disadvantaged positions in employment, housing and other areas relative even to the white working class (Rex and Tomlinson, 1979), while Miles refers to the formation of a distinct black ‘fraction’ of the working class (Miles, 1982).",10
754,"Moreover, this distinctive structural location has been remarkably resilient to change and it is commonly argued that schooling plays a big part in the reproduction over time of the position of black people in British society.",10
755,"More specifically, it has been suggested that the ‘underachievement’ of black pupils in schools has played a significant part in ensuring that second and third generation young British black people continue to find themselves suffering the ‘disadvantages’encountered by their parents and grandparents.",10
756,"However, as we shall see, the issue of black ‘underachievement’ in schools is rather more complex than might first appear to be the case.",10
757,Black ‘Underachievement’ in British Schools: Some Critical Questions,10
758,"There has been widespread concern in the last 20 years that children from Afro-Caribbean and Asian communities are underachieving in British schools  and, therefore, are at a disadvantage in entering further and higher education, acquiring professional and technical qualifications and in finding employment.",10
759,"Investigations carried out by ILEA in the 1960s tended to bear out this anxiety (Little, 1975), as did a variety of other surveys (for a useful review see Tomlinson, 1983, pp. 27–59).",10
760,"Much of the concern came from the black communities: in 1971 Bernard Coard, a black teacher, published an influential document entitled , while Afro-Caribbean parents and local teachers in Redbridge, frustrated by the relative lack of research and support, conducted their own investigation and in 1978 published disturbing evidence on the school performance of black children.",10
761,"A national inquiry was eventually established, initially under Anthony Rampton and then Lord Swann.",10
762,"Both the Rampton Report,(1981) and the Swann Report,(1985) appeared to confirm earlier anxieties.",10
763,"A survey of six LEAs conducted for Rampton revealed that only 3 of Afro-Caribbean school leavers gained five or more O level passes or CSE grade ones in 1978–79, compared with 18 of Asian pupils, 16 of other school leavers in these LEAs and 21 of all school leavers from state schools.",10
764,"Furthermore, at A level, only 2 of Afro-Caribbean students obtained one or more passes, compared with 13 of Asians, 12 of other school leavers in these LEAs and 13 of all leavers from state schools.",10
765,"However, the evidence on ‘underachievement’ that is now available from this and other investigations should be treated with considerable caution.",10
766,One important issue here concerns the comparability the validity of measures of achievement.,10
767,", although Rampton and Swann rely on public examinations, other studies have based their conclusions on a variety of other measures, including teacher assessments of reading or mathematics; moreover, many of these tests are likely to contain cultural bias or be affected by the fact that they were administered by white teachers or researchers (Hegarty and Lucas, 1979; Bagley, 1975).",10
768,"It is also questionable whether research undertaken in the 1960s and 1970s is relevant today, for the achievements of Afro-Caribbean and Asian pupils are constantly improving.",10
769,"When the six LEAs in the Rampton survey were studied again for the Swann Report, a larger proportion of Afro-Caribbean pupils were obtaining academic qualifications: the percentage of such pupils obtaining five or more higher grades at O level and CSE and those obtaining one or more passes at A level had doubled in the period from 1979 to 1982.",10
770,"Most studies focus on school achievement, but this may be misleading because there is evidence to suggest that Afro-Caribbean and Asian students are more likely than white students to stay on in further education and some do manage to obtain academic qualifications that had eluded them at school (Craft and Craft, 1983), while one investigation suggests that young black people in inner city areas had gained better academic qualifications than white  youth in the same areas (Roberts, Duggan and Noble, 1983), a finding borne out more generally by some other studies (Brown, 1984).",10
771,"Blanket comparisons between white, Afro-Caribbean and Asian pupils of the kind prevalent in most investigations can be highly misleading.",10
772,", although Rampton-type surveys suggest that Asian pupils are performing white pupils, there is growing evidence of wide variations in school achievement within the Asian communities: , children of Bangladeshi origin appear to be achieving at much lower levels than other Asian groups (House of Commons Home Affairs Committee, 1986).",10
773,Undifferentiated comparisons which ignore parental occupations and educational backgrounds and environmental conditions like housing are also of very limited value.,10
774,In other words the dimension of needs to be considered.,10
775,"However, few studies of relative achievement have taken social class into account and this is very unfortunate as there is now overwhelming evidence of a strong relationship between social class and educational achievement (for a recent overview see Mortimore and Blackstone, 1982).",10
776,"It is hardly surprising that the studies that have taken account of the social class background of white and black pupils tend to reveal that the dramatic differences produced by simple comparisons tend to diminish, often considerably (Bagley .,",10
777,1979).,10
778,"Thus, the achievements of white working class pupils — children whose parents are manual workers — are much closer to those of Afro-Caribbean pupils, and it is arguable that the findings of Rampton, Swann and similar investigations can be explained by the fact that a larger proportion of Afro-Caribbeans than whites are working class, and are likely to be earning less and living in worse housing than whites, as documented earlier in this chapter (Brown, 1984; Reeves and Chevannes, 1981).",10
779,"Similarly, the poorer progress of Bangladeshi children could be accounted for by the fact that Bangladeshi communities suffer from the effects of poor housing, poverty and high rates of unemployment (House of Commons Home Affairs Committee, 1986).",10
780,"Indeed the continuing higher levels of poverty and unemployment amongst all the black communities are likely to further affect the educational chances of black children, not least the implications of material deprivation and unemployment for the physical and mental health of both adults and children (Arnot, 1987; Taylor, 1987; Townsend, 1987,; Brah, 1986).",10
781,It is also important to differentiate between boys and girls.,10
782,"Some of the few studies that have taken account of gender suggest that Afro-Caribbean girls are achieving higher levels than boys at school level, partly because they are pursuing different strategies, which are necessary to survive in the context of high unemployment and low wages for black male workers (Fuller, 1983; see also Riley, 1986; Driver, 1977).",10
783,"Little systematic evidence on Asian girls is available , but it is emerging that their educational achievements are continually improving and it is clear that the common image of the docile Asian girl uninterested in education and ‘torn’ between western and  Asian cultures is a gross stereotype (Brah and Minhas, 1986).",10
784,", it is likely that unlike other girls they have a more positive attitude towards the sciences (Amos and Parmar, 1981; Fuller, 1983).",10
785,"Much previous research, in ignoring the social structural features of class and gender, has tended instead to focus on a variety of other factors in explaining supposed patterns of ‘underachievement’, most of which are now regarded as highly dubious.",10
786,The five most common explanations have been: Afro-Caribbean family structure; lack of parental interest and support for black pupils; low self-esteem; differences in IQ; and language difficulties.,10
787,"the first, it was often argued that Afro-Caribbean family and child-rearing patterns harmed the intellectual and educational development of black children, but the misleading assumptions about these patterns and consequences have now been effectively contested (Cross, 1978; Reeves and Chevannes, 1983).",10
788,"Moreover, all recent evidence suggests a high level of interest among both Afro-Caribbean and Asian parents in their children's schooling and records high aspirations for their children's performance (Tomlinson, 1984).",10
789,The third common explanation suggested that growing up in a white racist society and with few positive black public images created low self-esteem and self-concept in black children which in turn led to poor performance in schools.,10
790,"However, the evidence on this has been vigorously contested, especially by Maureen Stone, who argues that ‘no body of research has ever demonstrated unequivocally that the children of the working-class as a whole, poor children or black children , suffer from poor self-image or self-esteem’(Stone, 1981, p. 8), while Milner concludes that there are now higher measures on tests of black self-esteem than in earlier studies the rise of black political movements in both the USA and Britain which has fostered positive black self-images and consciousness (Milner, 1983).",10
791,"The idea that the educational achievements of black students can be explained by genetically inherited lower intellectual ability whites, as measured by IQ tests, has been even more vigorously challenged, with Kamin providing one of the most effective critiques (Kamin, 1977).",10
792,"A recent review of the IQ debate, commissioned by the Swann inquiry, concluded that the largest variation in IQ scores was caused by the social and economic conditions under which children grew up and pointed out, ‘If, therefore, we wish to affect the IQ scores of children from ethnic minorities, or indeed their school performance, we might make a start by improving the social and economic circumstances of their families’(Mackintosh and Mascie-Taylor, 1985, p. 148).",10
793,"Finally, language issues, a variety of debates are still in progress and it is premature to draw firm conclusions; however, there is some evidence to suggest that bilingualism may actually enhance educational performance (Houlton, 1986), that in the case of Afro-Caribbean pupils there may well be ‘dialect interference’, although it is clear too that some of the problems here may derive from the negative attitudes of teachers towards Creole (Edwards, 1979), and that in the case of some Bangladeshi pupils lack  of familiarity with English may be an obstacle to academic achievement (House of Commons Home Affairs Committee, 1986).",10
794,"Racism, Teacher Expectations and ‘Underachievement'",10
795,"The Rampton Report, , emphasized the role of both intentional and unintentional racism in the school context in depressing the performance of black pupils.",10
796,"The committee of inquiry found that many of the teachers they met held the view that Afro-Caribbean pupils ‘inevitably caused difficulties’ and were unlikely to achieve in academic terms, although they had high expectations of their potential in sport and the expressive arts (Rampton, 1981, p. 13).",10
797,"Other studies have also shown that many teachers express stereotyped and often contradictory generalizations about black pupils, with some teachers tending to regard Afro-Caribbean pupils as lazy and withdrawn while others thought them to be aggressive and disruptive; a common stereotype of Asian pupils among teachers is that they are passive and industrious but they and their parents are over-ambitious (Brittan, 1976; Giles, 1977; Verma, 1982; Lee and Wrench, 1983; Swann, 1985; Eggleston .,",10
798,1986).,10
799,"Although research in this area is limited, what there is indicates that teachers' negative conceptions of their black pupils often translate themselves into discriminatory practices in a variety of school contexts.",10
800,", it is difficult not to see a connection between the prejudiced views of heads and teachers involved in ESN-M referral processes and the overrepresentation of Afro-Caribbean children in special schools (Tomlinson, 1981).",10
801,"Green's research reported in Swann (1985) demonstrated that intolerant teachers gave least time and attention to Afro-Caribbean boys and Asian girls, while a major investigation,, documented that academically able Afro-Caribbean pupils were finding themselves relegated to lower bands and were being entered for examinations below their abilities, with teachers perceptions playing an important part in the discriminatory misallocation (Eggleston .,",10
802,1986).,10
803,"An inquiry into the referral and suspension of Afro-Caribbean pupils from Birmingham schools recorded that they were almost four times more likely to be suspended from secondary schools as white pupils; the main reason for expulsion was common to both white and black pupils, the latter were more likely to be suspended and the inquiry alluded to a considerable level of hostility, mistrust and ‘cultural misunderstanding’ black pupils and white teachers (CRE, 1985; see also Driver, 1979).",10
804,Afro-Caribbean and Asian children are indeed painfully aware that many teachers view them negatively and some studies have documented reports of routine racist remarks by teachers (see Wright in this volume).,10
805,"It is arguable that teacher expectations and behaviour could be creating an interactive process of low expectations, low achievements and black pupil  resistance, although it is important to recognize that teacher expectations do not automatically translate themselves into self-fulfilling prophecies (Short, 1985).",10
806,Equally important may be the ‘institutional racism’ embedded in various taken-for-granted features of the school.,10
807,", the curriculum may ignore or devalue black cultures and achievements and may also ignore racism as a structural phenomenon and as part of the daily experience of black pupils.",10
808,"Assemblies, dress requirements, school meals provision and links with parents may be insensitive to different cultural backgrounds and linguistic diversity.",10
809,There may be few black teachers in the school and fewer in senior positions.,10
810,"This is why the emphasis in multicultural and anti-racist education is now towards ‘whole school policies’, involving a fundamental reappraisal of the assumptions, practices and outcomes, intentional and unintentional, of school life (Straker-Welds, 1984; Arora and Duncan, 1986).",10
811,"Thus, on closer inspection, the issue of the ‘underachievement’ of black pupils in British schools turns out to be rather complex.",10
812,Given the inconclusive nature of the evidence on patterns of performance and the negative connotations of ‘underachievement’ it is time to drop the term and refer instead to relative levels of .,10
813,It should also be clear that future investigations and policies must take account of class and gender and be sensitive to possible differences between minority black communities.,10
814,Conclusion,10
815,"Indeed one of the major conclusions to be drawn from the historical and sociological discussion in this chapter is that a proper analysis of the operation of ‘race’ as an element in British society and education requires an understanding of its interrelationship with the structured and cultural divisions which derive from class and gender relations, in the context of an understanding of Britain's past imperial domination and its continuing legacies.",10
816,"However, it is also important to appreciate that the dynamics of ‘race’ and racism as dimensions of British society and education are now significantly affected by the ‘racialization’of British politics and the accelerated decline of the British economy in the context of recession and very specific state policies, some of which bear down particularly hard on black youth.",10
817,"The ‘racialization, of British politics throughout the last 20 years has ensured that most areas of public debate — law and order, the welfare state, unemployment, youth, education, the inner cities, the family — now have a racial dimension and often one in which black communities, but especially black youth, appear as threats in a wider demonology of scroungers, shirkers, muggers, drug pushers, school failures and inadequate parents (Hall .,",10
818,"1978; CCCS, 1982).",10
819,"The decline of British manufacturing industry has had a devastating impact on the inner cities where such a large proportion of the black population live and this has been exacerbated by racial discrimination by employers to yield high levels of  black youth unemployment (Martin and Rowthorn, 1986; Newnham, 1986).",10
820,"Insensitive and often racist policing have fused with inner urban decay to create a climate of both despair and rebellion in which black (and white) youth's sense of injustice has on several occasions provoked urban revolt (Benyon, 1984; West Midlands County Council, 1986; Gifford, 1986).",10
821,Schools may feel powerless to alter a situation in which wider economic and political forces have such a crucial influence.,10
822,But to ignore these issues would be a serious abnegation of their responsibility in combating racism and giving black communities a fair opportunity to make their rightful contribution and participate on equal democratic terms as citizens.,10
823,Some schools and LEAs have already begun to construct multicultural and anti-racist policies; it is the majority of institutions that appear not to have grasped the urgency of the issues to follow their lead.,10
824,"Education, Employment and Recruitment",10
825,Robert Moore,10
826,This chapter will consider the way in which educational qualifications are used in the labour market in the recruitment of young workers.,10
827,", recent studies have found that the use of qualifications varies significantly between different sectors of the labour market and is considerable regional variation.",10
828,Non-educational criteria almost invariably have priority in recruitment over educational ones and employers tend to have only the vaguest notions what particular qualifications entail or imply.,10
829,These factors are differentiated by sex and race and also work to reproduce gender and racial differentiation in employment (and unemployment).,10
830,The findings to be considered here (and the broader body of research of which they are typical) suggest that the link between education and occupation is much more tenuous than is often supposed and call into question many of the assumptions currently held about employers’ attitudes to young workers and to educational standards.,10
831,This is particularly significant given the place of these assumptions within the occupationalist rhetoric of the present assault upon education and liberal education .,10
832,Qualifications and Recruitment,10
833,A number of illuminating pieces of research have been published recently which look in detail at the way in which qualifications are used by employers in the process of the recruitment of young workers.,10
834,"Cumin, , traces a group of school leavers from school, through the labour market and into employment.",10
835,"He notes a sharp contrast between the expectations of pupils, parents and teachers about the importance of qualifications and their real significance (Cumin, 1983).",10
836,"A study by Jones (Jones, 1983) provides detailed evidence on the almost complete lack of communication between examination boards and employers and on the uninformed and arbitrary way in which employers use qualifications.",10
837,Ashton .,10
838,"(1982, 1986), in an extremely thorough investigation of the relative positions of young workers in  contrasting local labour markets, define a number of different recruitment strategies in which qualifications vary in significance, are used in different ways and are almost invariably of secondary importance other factors.",10
839,It is precisely the subordinate role of qualifications which is the striking feature of this type of detailed work.,10
840,(a) Expectations and Practice,10
841,The study by Cumin follows a group of school leavers from their college in Leicestershire out into ‘the world of work’.,10
842,The purpose was to discover precisely how important qualifications were in determining their occupational chances.,10
843,"The study begins by noting the high expectations that the pupils, their parents and their teachers had in this regard.",10
844,"Fifty-seven of pupils and 62 of parents thought that qualifications would be , and 98 and 96 respectively thought they would be either or important.",10
845,"After examining what happened in practice, Cumin concludes that these expectations were not ‘based upon actuality’(p. 58).",10
846,The study found that 56 of the jobs taken by the young people in fact had no formal educational requirements attached to them.,10
847,"In the end, only 15 of the school leavers considered that their qualifications had been essential to their getting jobs.",10
848,Cumin makes the significant point that employers appoint school leavers to posts examination results are known in any case.,10
849,It is very rare for young people recruited on that basis to be sacked if they subsequently fail to pass the exam or gain a certain grade.,10
850,Obviously the simple non-availability of the result must severely limit the significance that employers can place on exam-passing .,10
851,"However, the limitations upon examinations in shaping recruitment practices are not restricted to the effects of this particular practical exigency.",10
852,Employers in the main seem to see little direct relevance of education to specific job requirements.,10
853,"This would seem to be the general conclusion of research in this area, and Cumin's conclusion that:",10
854,"the overall needs employers had of young people, it was clear that non-academic criteria, attitudes to work and personal characteristics, and basic skills, essentially those of reading, writing and arithmetic, were far more important to employers than academic qualifications.",10
855,"(ibid, p. 57)",10
856,is one widely echoed elsewhere.,10
857,(b) Employers and qualifications,10
858,"The study by Jones () provides information on the use of qualifications by employers in three English regions (London and the South East, the West Midlands, and Yorkshire and Humberside) and also includes some comparisons with other European countries.",10
859,"Fifteen hundred establishments were surveyed, ranging in size from employing 25 to 500, and spanning lo sectors of the Revised Standard Classification of Industry.",10
860,Five  categories of workers were defined:and .,10
861,These categories were represented to varying degrees in the various sectors.,10
862,"Employers were found to use five main selection devices:, and .",10
863,"The relative importance of academic qualifications varied between categories, being more significant for non-manual than for manual workers.",10
864,In all cases the interview was the most important device with qualifications coming second for non-manuals.,10
865,The level of qualifications varied the level of employment.,10
866,There was particular emphasis upon English and Maths.,10
867,Jones concludes her detailed investigation by saying that:,10
868,"These figures suggest that employers, with the present education system, largely feel that basic knowledge in a few subjects is all that they find useful for their purpose.",10
869,Case study experience further suggests that even this use is questionable.,10
870,Observation…suggest(s) that employers' expectations of the subject content and skills are often very wide of the mark.,10
871,This appears especially true of Maths.,10
872,"Physics and English, the most frequently required subjects.",10
873,"(ibid, p. 22)",10
874,The report shows that employers tend to have only extremely vague notions what examinations in particular subjects actually involve.,10
875,There was virtually direct communication between employers and examination boards.,10
876,"22 GCE and CSE examination boards, only 8 (all CSE) gave out information specific to employers and only 9 (8 CSE and i GCE) actively disseminated information to employers.",10
877,"At the same time, only 11 boards (8 CSE and 3 GCE) reported ever having received requests for information from employers.",10
878,Only 3 boards (1 CSE and 2 GCE) had an interest in researching employers' views.,10
879,"Given this, it is probably not surprising that even where qualifications were stipulated, the requirement was not rigidly enforced.",10
880,"Jones found that although a reasonably high number of employers thought that qualifications were desirable, less than half thought them to be essential.",10
881,"Even where they did, there was a fair degree of flexibility.",10
882,"Interestingly, ‘’ employers saw examinations as essential for (ibid., p. 23).",10
883,"Rather, they were demanded most rigorously where involved FE or professional courses where the educational qualification was an .",10
884,"In other words, the educational qualification was related to further needs, not to the needs of jobs as such.",10
885,Jones concludes that ‘These results support the…assertion that desirability of certain qualifications is not closely related to actual job performance.’,10
886,(.),10
887,(c) Recruitment strategies,10
888,The findings of Jones's work are very much those of Ashton .,10
889,(1983).,10
890,"Only half of the employers interviewed in Leicester, Sunderland and St Albans thought that qualifications were useful as ‘’(ibid., p. 55).",10
891,Twenty-three of them thought that ‘’ and 27 of them considered them to be of no use .,10
892,Forty-five of the first group (i.e. 45 of 50 ) thought them to be a true measure of ability and a third saw them as useful indicators of attitude.,10
893,"In the second group, 69 thought that other factors were more important than qualifications, and in the third, 75 ignored them altogether or considered them meaningless.",10
894,Ashton .,10
895,found that employers adopt a range of in which educational qualifications are combined with other attributes to varying degrees.,10
896,"The most common approach was that where ‘’(ibid., p. 52).",10
897,It is important to note that the educational qualifications are not being treated as an of non-educational attributes (e.g. docility).,10
898,The other factors which employers take into account () are seen as from education.,10
899,The authors define recruitment strategies which can be summarized as follows:,10
900,1,10
901,educational qualifications perform a function.,10
902,"Here the qualification is the most important criterion in recruitment although other factors might be considered in the interview stage, though in a subordinate role;",10
903,2,10
904,educational qualifications perform a function.,10
905,Qualifications are used to pre-select the sample of candidates.,10
906,A minimum level is set and those at or above that level are then selected by criteria.,10
907,Qualifications above the minimum bestow no advantage;,10
908,3,10
909,educational qualifications perform a function.,10
910,They will be waived if a candidate possesses the appropriate non-academic criteria.,10
911,This is the point at which non-academic come to take precedence over academic criteria.,10
912,4,10
913,educational qualifications are .,10
914,Recruitment is based on personality or physical attributes which are seen as having to do with education;,10
915,5,10
916,educational qualifications have a function.,10
917,Qualifications the person from being considered (e.g. on the grounds that they will become easily bored or might become a trouble maker).,10
918,"It is, , being assumed here that there is some kind of relationship between the qualification level and the nature of the work.",10
919,In this study ii was the which was most commonly used (53 ) followed by the fourth (39 ).,10
920,Hence non-academic criteria have a clear priority over the academic.,10
921,"The use of strategies varied the occupational category: at the level, 82 of employers used strategy 2, and at the level it was used by 74 .",10
922,Strategy 3 was that  most used for (57 ) and for (60 ).,10
923,"At the level, strategy four is most common (see ibid., Table 49).",10
924,The use of different strategies relates to the size of the firm.,10
925,", larger firms tended to make more use of qualifications (possibly reflecting the existence of a trained personnel staff who themselves owe their position to qualifications).",10
926,More reliance was placed upon O than A levels.,10
927,"The study found that 72 of employers in the top size band saw qualifications as useful as against only 30 in the smallest, where 49 saw them as not useful compared with only 12 in the largest (see ibid., Tables 46, 48 and 50).",10
928,The size of the establishment could reasonably be expected to affect the number of young people being exposed to the different recruitment strategies (although the relative numbers of small employers would also have to be borne in mind).,10
929,"However, it was found that many large companies took on very few young people (20 of those employing above i, 000 recruited fewer than ten per year (ibid., p. 47)).",10
930,"Hence, ‘the relationship between the size of the employing unit and the number of young people recruited each year was not as close as might have been expected’(ibid., p. 47).",10
931,Ashton extremely detailed studies indicate the dangers of generalizing about the education/production relationship.,10
932,Their more recent work emphasizes the very considerable regional variations which reflect relative unemployment rates.,10
933,"The complex variations and interactions between factors recruitment strategies, size of firm, sector, area and local industry mix introduce a wide range of contingencies into the situation which are further complicated by gender and race.",10
934,"Employers, Educational Standards and Young Workers",10
935,A central plank of the current attack upon education and the teaching profession (and one which has grown since Callaghan's Great Debate speech) is that of employers' dissatisfaction with educational standards and with the quality of young workers.,10
936,This alleged ‘failure’ teachers is a main feature of the rhetoric which legitimates the changes which are being imposed.,10
937,Consequently it is important to critically examine its basis in reality.,10
938,The type of detailed empirical research reviewed above suggests that scepticism is to be strongly recommended.,10
939,"Employers, in fact, appear to be not only ill-informed about education but relatively arbitrary in the uses to which they put it.",10
940,"Given the crucial role that the Manpower Services Commission has played in the undermining of education and the construction of its current occupationalist surrogate, its contribution to this debate deserves close scrutiny.",10
941,It is ironic that the (MSC's) Holland Report was published in the same year (1977) as the Shirley Williams' Green Paper on   education which followed on from ‘The Great Debate’.,10
942,The Holland Report looked explicitly at the issue of employers' dissatisfaction with young workers and presented its information in such a way as to support the idea of education's failure in this area.,10
943,I have suggested elsewhere that their presentation of their evidence benefits from closer examination.,10
944,The Report discusses employers' evaluations of young workers older ones thirteen ‘essential attributes’.,10
945,"In the case of unskilled/ semi-skilled young workers (i.e. the YOP/YTS target group), 81 of the employers listed ‘’ as the most important attribute.",10
946,"The second most popular one was ‘, mentioned by 47 , followed by ‘’(39 ) and ‘’(36 ).",10
947,"’) appears fifth, being mentioned by only 21 of employers.",10
948,The rest of the thirteen essential attributes range between a mention by 20 for ‘’ down to a mere 2 for ‘' (!),10
949,The discussion which follows in the Report for young people is  based mainly on a which is established by subtracting the number of employers who think that young people are than older workers from those who think that they are on each of these attributes.,10
950,On this basis they come out very badly with marks on nine the thirteen attributes.,10
951,"However, inspection shows that there are in fact three employer positions:(1), or, if they are different, are (2)or (3).",10
952,The on which young people do so badly is derived .,10
953,It is a simple arithmetical exercise to reconstitute the original figures.,10
954,"When this is done, a rather different picture emerges.",10
955,"In fact, young people come out worse on only the thirteen attributes older workers.",10
956,"Two of these are directly —‘past experience’(), and ‘mature/stable’().",10
957,The third is ‘good written English/literate’().,10
958,"Ironically, the attribute on which young people do best older workers is which actually comes of the employers' list of essential attributes, being mentioned by only 2 of employers!",10
959,"In fact, employers give the educational attributes a low priority.",10
960,The data corresponds precisely to the situation described by Ashton recruitment strategies with criteria taking priority over educational ones.,10
961,The top four attributes are each of this type.,10
962,"If we take the attribute which employers most often saw as ‘essential’,(mentioned by 81 ), we see that the MSC's poor rating of — 32 in fact reflects a negative judgement by less than half of employers (53 said that young workers are in this respect and 43 of those said they were ).",10
963,"In fact, this represents the precise of the MSC position —!",10
964,Interestingly this figure is consistent with that most often encountered in the literature in this area where usually between 70 to 80 of employers are favourable to young workers.,10
965,"Ashton .,",10
966,", say that:",10
967,"Despite the many grumbles and adverse comments, 70 of all employers interviewed claimed to have been satisfied with the standard of work of young people taken on by them in the previous two years, and only 14 expressed dissatisfaction.",10
968,"Indeed, of the respondents in the 60 establishments employing over 5,000 workers, all but one expressed satisfaction.",10
969,"(Ashton .,",10
970,"1983, p. 56)",10
971,The probable significance of all this is that it is mistaken to attempt to about employers' attitudes to young workers.,10
972,"Clearly many dissatisfied and feel that they point to declining standards (e.g. in the numeracy of engineering apprentices), but this situation is more likely to reflect changing social patterns of recruitment a real decline in ‘educational standards’.",10
973,Paradoxically it could result from an actual general in standards combined with expanding opportunities in further and higher education.,10
974,The ‘type of lad’ who once became an apprentice now goes on to take an engineering degree and is replaced at that qualification level by a different category of young person.,10
975,In earlier times the former had been educationally whereas the latter are now near the of their attainment level.,10
976,"If these complex changes over time in the relationship between general improvements in attainment, social bases of recruitment and expanded further educational opportunities are not taken into account, the general improvement can appear from the of an employer as a in standards.",10
977,Work experience,10
978,"As the examination of the Holland Report data indicates, the problem which young people have in the labour market reflects the age-related issue of .",10
979,It is this defective education that disadvantages them.,10
980,"An examination by Richards (1982) of the factors employed in the recruitment of apprentices in the East Midlands illustrates some of the problems in this area, especially the current occupationalist assertion that young people will benefit from a more ‘vocational’ education to counteract their lack of experience.",10
981,Richards asked employers about the factors they took into account when recruiting apprentices.,10
982,"The percentages of employers mentioning the following were:(92 ),(85 ),(84 ),(77 ),(73 ),(68 ),(52 )(Richards, 1982, Table B, p. 7).",10
983,The poor showing of school work experience is striking.,10
984,The reasons for this are illuminating.,10
985,The contrast between work experience schemes and  work experience lies in the fact that the latter is taken by employers as evidence of and ).,10
986,Paper rounds were seen as significant in these respects.,10
987,"Work experience, on the other hand, was seen by employers as part of discipline and as giving little information about the pupil as an individual.",10
988,Richards says that:,10
989,The features that impressed these employers about the spare/part-time jobs of young people applying for apprenticeships in their firms were mainly elements which were absent in WE schemes.,10
990,WE schemes did not involve the ‘initiative’ involved in going out and finding your own part-time job.,10
991,This was all done by the school following DES and LEA guidelines.,10
992,The element of ‘reliability’(getting up early consistently for a substantial period of time etc.) was also absent.,10
993,"(ibid., p. 9)",10
994,"Where employers see value in work experience schemes, it had to do with information about .",10
995,They felt that such schemes allowed young people to have direct experience of engineering relying purely upon second-hand information (from teachers or the media).,10
996,"If they then still chose to seek engineering jobs, this could be seen as evidence of .",10
997,This is a central feature of the employers' view.,10
998,Richards found a preoccupation amongst employers with the of engineering.,10
999,"They were very concerned that pupils, and the ‘bright’ ones , should be given a view of the industry and be attracted to it.",10
1000,This was the main value they attributed to school work experience seeing it in any direct sense as for engineering work.,10
1001,Richards's conclusion is that:,10
1002,"these employers it was teachers who needed WE more than pupils, they could get a picture of what engineering was really like (media misrepresentations — strikes, redundancies, etc.) and so put across a ‘good image’ of engineering, hopefully attracting the ‘brighter pupils’into the industry.",10
1003,"(ibid., p. 11)",10
1004,"As far as the actual of the education was concerned, the employers wanted no more than a solid, grounding in ‘the basics’ and that ‘bright pupils’should be positively encouraged to seek jobs in the industrial sector in the academic world or public services.",10
1005,"The major problem was seen to be the towards industrial and commercial values and the way in which this deflected ‘bright’,pupils industry.",10
1006,It was not for production that the schools should be providing but .,10
1007,"Furthermore, this exercise should be aimed at the ‘bright’ pupils.",10
1008,Richards says that:,10
1009,Some writers went on to argue that attracting high ability youngsters into manufacturing industry was one of the conditions for a regeneration of the British economy.,10
1010,"Employers making these connections between the  ‘ignorance’ of ‘our brightest children’, WE, the entry of these youngsters into manufacturing industry and the rejuvenation of British capitalism were clearly ’(ibid., p. 16, my emphasis).",10
1011,We can say that the problem being defined here is not so much that the pupils are getting (though they might be getting the wrong teachers) as that industry is getting the !,10
1012,The ‘high fliers’ go elsewhere.,10
1013,"This reflects the antipathy towards industry and commerce from traditionally educated, liberal-humanist teachers.",10
1014,It is who need to be changed.,10
1015,Richards argues that employers' attitudes imply a of work experience —for the high-fliers and for the rest.,10
1016,"In the case of the former, it is a a vocational education which is required, and the latter, the evidence suggests that employers are really indifferent to education.",10
1017,"so much of the occupationalist initiative in education and outside (YTS, etc.) is aimed at the lower academic ability bands, it is useful to emphasize certain points:",10
1018,1,10
1019,the evidence strongly indicates that employers are not especially concerned with the educational attainment of young workers in those sectors of the labour market in which such individuals tend to seek employment.,10
1020,Non-educational criteria have a clear priority in recruitment strategies;,10
1021,2,10
1022,this reflects the fact that occupational skill levels are of such a low order that they present no real requirement for educational preparation.,10
1023,"Indeed, even is problematical — as the Further Education Unit, , has conceded.",10
1024,"Where extended education or training is provided (e.g. youth unemployment) it tends, consequently, to stress so-called or technical skills.",10
1025,This has the important implication of presenting these young people as personally and socially and .,10
1026,3,10
1027,"significantly, pupils of this type tend to have acquired significant degrees of work experience through part-time and spare-time work and also to possess the social skills of network membership which facilitate grape-vine recruitment (, both of these things are affected by local unemployment levels).",10
1028,These issues will be looked at in more detail below.,10
1029,"It is important to stress that (a) this type of work experience is precisely that welcomed by employers, and (b) such young people are members of labour market social networks.",10
1030,Recruitment and the problems of youth,10
1031,"If young people are not deficient in the ways that current rhetoric suggests, then what is the explanation for the high levels of youth unemployment?",10
1032,The view that they lack work experience is contradicted by a substantial body of  evidence.,10
1033,"A study by Finn (1987), , illustrates the tendency for non-academic young people to have comparatively more such informal work experience.",10
1034,"Lack of conventional school success cannot be seen, in any straightforward way, as indicative of problems in coping with working life.",10
1035,"I have suggested elsewhere that difficult behaviour at school can, in fact, reflect a readiness for work and the resentment at having that ambition frustrated (Moore, 1984).",10
1036,"Clarke, in a review of the literature on the transition to work, says that it tends to support the view that the ‘majority of early leavers adjust fairly painlessly to working life’(Clarke, 1980, p. 10).",10
1037,She concludes a section on young people ‘at risk’ with the statement that:,10
1038,"This suggests, rather unpalatably, that bright children who do well at both school and work, it is those children who are apathetic about, or even alienated from, school who adjust best to work.",10
1039,"(ibid., p. 11)",10
1040,The major problem that young people suffer is simply that they are .,10
1041,The re-presented Holland Report data showed how young people are judged to be ‘worse’ by employers on age-related attributes.,10
1042,"Obviously, however much informal work experience young people may have acquired, it cannot compete with that of older workers.",10
1043,"However, there is a more significant factor.",10
1044,The Holland Report states that:,10
1045,"Whilst over a third of employers thought there was no difference, those employers who did state a preference were, in almost all cases, more likely to prefer other recruits to young people.",10
1046,"This was especially true when young people were compared to up-graded existing employees, those recruited from other firms or women returning to work.",10
1047,"(Holland, , p. 41)",10
1048,"Employers' preference for various categories of older workers reflects, , the importance of on-the-job training and experience over that of formal education (especially recruitment within the firm's ).",10
1049,"But it also reflects the fact that older workers are, by virtue of their life situation,.",10
1050,The significance of to work has been highlighted by numerous studies.,10
1051,It is important to note that this is not simply to do with naturalistic notions of ‘emotional maturity’.,10
1052,"Blackburn and Mann, on the basis of their extensive study of the labour market for semi and unskilled labour in Peterborough, say that:",10
1053,"The ideal worker is male, around thirty, married with small children, related to other employees and with a stable educational and work history.",10
1054,"He is not necessarily cleverer than other workers, but his commitments are less likely to make him jeopardise his job.",10
1055,"(Blackburn and Mann, 1979, p. 13)",10
1056,What is significant about the ‘ideal worker’ has nothing to do with his (the female ‘ideal’is usually somewhat different) education .,10
1057,"It is simply that he a married man, around 30, with wife and children, a car, a mortgage (?) etc., etc.",10
1058,"Employers' preferences refer not to personality characteristics developed by a specialized, occupational socializing agency —— but to .",10
1059,The difference between the young and the adult worker reflects their different positions on the trajectories of (common) social career paths.,10
1060,"It is not ‘the dull compulsion of the labour market’ which disciplines the worker through the brute necessities of basic subsistence, but the more developed range of needs and commitments which trap them in, what Blackburn and Mann call, ‘the life cycle squeeze’(ibid., p. 108).",10
1061,"The ideal model helps to differentiate the workforce (by age, sex and colour) how far different groups approximate to the model and can be seen as representing its exemplary qualities of commitment and reliability.",10
1062,This kind of division in the labour market between youth and adults jobs was also investigated by Ashton .,10
1063,(1986).,10
1064,"In a similar fashion, changes in opportunities reflect the development of the social career.",10
1065,Age barriers also served to structure the young adults' experience of the labour market.,10
1066,This was particularly true of the unemployed.,10
1067,"They were too old for most of the jobs which provided training and which only recruit school or college leavers, and too young for many of the adult jobs which required recruits to be over 21, and where employers .",10
1068,"(Ashton .,",10
1069,"1986, p. 104, my emphasis)",10
1070,Equally it is the case that the lack of opportunity to participate in employment blocks the development of the social career.,10
1071,Occupational and social careers are mutually facilitating in this respect.,10
1072,"Unemployment does not only deny an adequate income, it can create deep crises of social identity.",10
1073,Recruitment and the Meaning Process,10
1074,Investigation of recruitment strategies indicates that the role of education in occupational allocation is much more contingent than is often allowed.,10
1075,The relationship between qualifications and jobs is attenuated by the complexities of labour market segmentation and this itself is local diversification.,10
1076,The importance of labour market segmentation is emphasized in Ashton most recent study (1986).,10
1077,This work stresses the fact that there is no simple hierarchy of jobs (matched by a corresponding hierarchy of educational qualifications).,10
1078,"The segmentation of the occupational system effectively creates discrete spheres of employment which exhibit radical discontinuities their structures, processes and possibilities.",10
1079,"These in turn are associated with distinctive entry requirements, varying uses of qualifications in recruitment and career development (where career development occurs ), differing pre and post entry orientations to work by young workers and differential effects by age, sex and ‘race’.",10
1080,Ashton .,10
1081,also stress the importance of labour markets and argue that their variations can have more significant effects than social class  differences.,10
1082,"They conceptualize these differences ‘separate local labour market cultures’(ibid., p. 104).",10
1083,A particularly significant feature of these ‘cultures’ occupational recruitment is that of or recruitment.,10
1084,This informal method was found to become increasingly important as individuals moved into second and subsequent jobs.,10
1085,"This reflects, the authors argue, an ‘increasing awareness of the ways in which employers recruit’(ibid., p. 84).",10
1086,"Job-search, on this basis, is seen as ‘more efficient, it is more closely aligned to employers’ recruitment methods' (.).",10
1087,"At the third job level, between 25 and 60 of recruits found their position through ‘word of mouth’.",10
1088,"Granovetter (a pioneer of the study of this dimension of recruitment) has argued that sociologists and economists have seriously neglected this aspect of ‘the matching process’, i.e. the process whereby individuals come to get the jobs they do (Granovetter, 1975).",10
1089,He stresses the rationality and efficiency of network recruitment for both employers and prospective employees.,10
1090,It is a cheaper and more reliable way of getting information about jobs or workers.,10
1091,"Furthermore, my empirical work suggests that the signal chosen in the usual models — education — is not actually the main conveyer of information in labour markets.",10
1092,"It is true that most jobs have clear cut educational requirements, employers assume workers lacking them to be unqualified.",10
1093,"This is, however, a crude sort of screen indeed, and if used alone would leave the employer still with a large and unmanageable information problem.",10
1094,"On paper, there are few jobs for which large numbers of people are not qualified; in practice, employers use a more refined and differentiated signal than educational qualifications: they use the recommendations of people personally known to them and prospective employees.",10
1095,"Similarly, prospective employees know better than to rely on landscaping or other signals put out by employers and attempt, instead, to find out the inside story from their contacts.",10
1096,"(Granovetter, 1981, p. 25)",10
1097,He points out that processes of this type are difficult to accommodate within orthodox economics because they are not amenable to ‘costing’ in the standard economic sense.,10
1098,"this, and despite their obviousness to commonsense experience, they have been excluded from formal analysis.",10
1099,Granovetter's original sample of workers in the Boston (Mass.) area indicates that these processes are not restricted to either élite ‘old boy networks’ or to tight-knit working class communities dockers or printers.,10
1100,The basic rationality principle of their greater efficiency holds across the occupational system.,10
1101,"There is, however, a further dimension to network recruitment which goes beyond the basic exchange of information.",10
1102,This has to do with the way in which network involves possession of the and reciprocal relationships which that membership entails.,10
1103,"Grieco, in a fascinating and detailed series of ethnographic studies of  working-class networks in this country, has pointed to a number of advantages which workers and employers gain from ‘the network’:.",10
1104,"Firstly, employee referrals provide the cheapest method of obtaining labour.",10
1105,"Secondly, employee referrals provide an efficient screening mechanism.",10
1106,"Thirdly, recruitment through employees acts as a form of control since responsibilities and obligations hold between workers so recruited: for if the sponsored antagonizes the employer, the reputation of the sponsor himself will be damaged; thus, the new worker is constrained by the interests and reputation of his sponsor.",10
1107,"(Grieco, 1984, p. 30)",10
1108,A number of significant points emerge from these studies:,10
1109,1,10
1110,"network membership supplies not only information, but also the which enable individuals to become competent and accepted members of occupational groups.",10
1111,2,10
1112,"membership provides a means of social control in the workplace both because those recruited have an obligation to preserve the reputation of their sponsors and also because, in some authority principles can be transferred from the home to the job, e.g. as with a ‘dads’ lads' recruitment system.",10
1113,3,10
1114,"membership also provides a source of social support in the workplace while a newcomer learns the ropes and the tricks of the trade, e.g. network members will make up shortfalls in production while the newcomer settles in.",10
1115,People without access to these support mechanisms can be severely disadvantaged.,10
1116,4,10
1117,"Grieco's work has also pointed to the wider social importance of in maintaining and enforcing the system of network reciprocity, not themselves in work.",10
1118,"She also stresses the strategic,role of the network in maintaining employment opportunities a ‘family’ income.",10
1119,This has important implications for current trends in thinking about the role of the family (and the extended family) in the occupational system of advanced societies and for certain feminist approaches to the issues of women in the labour market which tend to operate from an essentially middle class paradigm of the career and salary and the consequent marginalization of women in the domestic context.,10
1120,"Although it is possible to see networks as a mechanism through which workers exercise some ‘degree of control over their labour market, it is important to acknowledge the extent to which they are, by definition,.",10
1121,"Lack of access to network membership can be a major limitation upon employment opportunities and, consequently, a major source of labour market differentiation.",10
1122,"As Jenkins and Troyna (and other contributors) have pointed out (in Troyna and Smith (eds), 1983), this has a particular impact upon ethnic minority groups.",10
1123,"First, in an organisation with an all white or largely white workforce, network recruitment will help to ensure that this stays the case, particularly at a time when large numbers of white workers are unemployed and prepared to re-enter the comparatively poorly paid and less pleasant jobs they deserted in the past few years.",10
1124,", this will help to ensure that black workers remain in those employment sectors they entered in the boom years of the 50's and 60's.",10
1125,"Secondly, and the reasons for this are unclear, there is good reason to suggest that West Indian workers are more likely to use formal or official job-search channels than are whites or Asians, who use informal channels to a comparatively greater extent.",10
1126,(ibid. pp. 14–15),10
1127,"This indicates a powerful way in which labour market factors can effectively negate advances, e.g., in changing the pattern of ‘racial’ or gender inequalities in attainment.",10
1128,"It is striking how certain minority groups tend to achieve mean levels of attainment above those of the white majority, they still remain heavily disadvantaged in employment terms.",10
1129,A similar point about the way in which labour market structures and processes limit educational reform can be made gender.,10
1130,Crompton and Jones (1984) have highlighted the significance of the relationship between and professional qualifications in shaping the gender inequalities in white collar employment which emerge as occupational careers develop.,10
1131,"In their study, young men and women were very similar in their academic qualifications at O and A level at the point of entry into work.",10
1132,"As a result of the bi-modal pattern of female involvement in paid employment (reflecting the demands of child rearing), women tend to be absent from work during the period in which men tend to acquire the post-entry qualifications which are required for promotion.",10
1133,This points to the importance of the relationship of education to the articulation between social and occupational career paths and to specific labour market structures Internal Labour Markets.,10
1134,It also suggests that educational reforms will be of limited success unless complemented by policies contract compliance which act directly upon demand-side institutions.,10
1135,A general implication of the material considered throughout has been the limitation of supply-side analysis.,10
1136,Conclusion,10
1137,The material reviewed in this chapter indicates that the manner in which educational qualifications are used in employment is both highly variable and a wide range of contingent factors located in labour market structures and processes.,10
1138,"Specifically, the following points can be made:",10
1139,1,10
1140,Employers have tended to be extremely ill-informed about the content of educational courses and the significance of qualifications.,10
1141,2,10
1142,Little direct relationship is seen to exist between specific qualifications and actual job requirements.,10
1143,3,10
1144,Qualifications are invariably used alongside other criteria and these usually take priority in recruitment.,10
1145,4,10
1146,Employers tend to use a range of recruitment strategies employing a number of devices.,10
1147,"Their use and the relative significance and the role of education varies sector, size of firm, level of recruitment and local conditions.",10
1148,5,10
1149,"Given employers' lack of knowledge about qualifications and the relatively arbitrary way in which they use them, it is difficult to give credence to the widespread notion that they are dissatisfied with the educational levels of young workers.",10
1150,The evidence suggests that they are often indifferent to their educational attainment and are interested in only a narrow range of basic skills or in traditional education for the ‘high-fliers’.,10
1151,", employers seem to be satisfied with those young workers they employ.",10
1152,6,10
1153,This is consistent with the findings which indicate that young people tend to adjust relatively easily to working life and that the less academic tend to do so more than others.,10
1154,7,10
1155,"Young workers are disadvantaged in the labour market mainly by itself and the view that, their lack of family commitments, they will be unreliable.",10
1156,Evidence suggests that jobs are often distributed age-life cycle criteria.,10
1157,The material considered emphasizes the importance of labour market structures and processes in mediating the relationship between education and production and between qualifications and work.,10
1158,It also suggests that they create radical discontinuities between the educational and occupational systems which are a major limitation upon the effectiveness of educational reforms.,10
1159,This both attenuates the force of the current occupationalist attack upon the liberal education tradition and suggests that occupationalist objectives will do little more than merely dilute the quality of the education which pupils might otherwise have received.,10
1160,It also suggests that teachers should oppose their critics on grounds being forced continually onto the sterile terrain of vocationalism.,10
1161,"More generally, it can be suggested that the social reforms which have been pursued through reform in the post-war period, collapse of the liberal consensus and its political constituency, need to be approached through a direct assault upon the sources of inequality in institutions.",10

1164,Introduction,10
1165,One of the most difficult questions which teachers ask themselves throughout their professional lives concerns the nature of the differences between pupils.,10
1166,"How can pupils be categorized and what are the consequences of perceiving, labelling and responding to pupils in certain ways?",10
1167,"The processes through which questions these are framed and the answers which seem acceptable are already determined by a whole range of social factors outside the control of teachers; by the nature of the social hierarchy, and the distribution of resources in society, by a general set of assumptions current among those who take political and economic decisions, and by the way in which education is institutionalized and so schools are organized.",10
1168,"Thus the economic, political and organizational contexts within which teachers work determine which pupil categorizations they take for granted, which they question and dispute, and what those categorizations are.",10
1169,This social creation of significant labels can be demonstrated by noting how the salience of labels changes over time.,10
1170,"Some differences, those based on sex, have for decades simply been taken for granted as natural and unproblematic.",10
1171,"The majority of teachers in state schools accepted as inevitable that boys and girls would behave differently in school, would find different forms of knowledge congenial, would achieve differently and aspire to differing occupations.",10
1172,The past three decades have seen such assumptions challenged.,10
1173,"Sexism is a term used to refer to a whole range of justifications which supposedly make acceptable the inequalities in income, in job statuses, in promotion chances and in access to power, , from which women suffer.",10
1174,Differential treatment and discrimination is condoned and made to appear normal.,10
1175,"Attempts to highlight and remove differing forms of sexism, sexual inequalities and discrimination in schools have led to a range of policy statements and strategies from local education authorities and individual schools.",10
1176,"These policy initiatives have been variously labelled as Equal Opportunities, Girl Friendly Schooling and anti-sexist programmes (see Arnot, 1986b).",10
1177,The emergence of such policies illustrates the dramatic shift that has occurred within a relatively short space of time in the social interpretation of sexual differences and inequalities.,10
1178,"‘Race’ and ethnic origin are also accepted labels, attached to pupils to describe who they are, their meaning taken for granted by politicians, administrators and teachers.",10
1179,The emergence of ‘race’ and racism as political and educational issues and the consequent range of educational policy responses are outlined in the article by Ali Rattansi in this volume.,10
1180,"He illustrates the ways in which differing policies, summarized by the terms multi-culturalism and anti-racism, focus upon different dimensions of black experiences and white behaviour.",10
1181,"Both policy forms are, however, concerned with inequalities, discrimination, and differential treatment based on colour and the forms of racism which are used as justifications for such behaviour.",10
1182,"Thus inequalities based on sex or ‘race’, both within the whole social system and within schools, provide the context for the emergence of particular educational policies.",10
1183,This article focuses upon these educational policies.,10
1184,"It asks why pupils have been categorized their sex or ‘race’, why girls and black pupils have been defined as problems; what is meant by racism and sexism within policy initiatives and it asks what are the consequences for teachers of labelling and categorizing problems in particular ways.",10
1185,In trying to provide some answers to these questions I shall demonstrate the ways in which anti-racist and anti-sexist policies frequently mirror in rhetoric and analysis.,10
1186,At the same time they contain both obvious and hidden differences which also need exploring.,10
1187,Race and Sex as Categories,10
1188,"The emergence of educational policies which focus on the school and college experiences of black and female students necessitates the use of ‘race’ and sex as significant categories, labelling students in such a way as to highlight both specific aspects of their identity and group membership and particular educational problems.",10
1189,"Girls and boys, women and men, black and white students are differentiated and polarized.",10
1190,"Girls' educational experiences are shown to compare unfavourably with those of boys; similarly, black students' experiences are contrasted with those of white students, or West Indian and Asian students are contrasted with white students.",10
1191,These are taken-for-granted groupings which assume some form of unity within each category without ever clearly identifying the source of this unity.,10
1192,"Is it biological, cultural or material, or is it the result of some aspect of personal and social experiences?",10
1193,It may appear that male and female students are polarized on the basis of biology.,10
1194,"But the emergence of the term to signify social arrangements consequent upon, but not determined by, biological differences, highlights the complex relationship between biology and culture.",10
1195,The term gender will be used to refer to the social construction of sexual differences.,10
1196,"The first task in scrutinizing educational policies, therefore, must be to examine their implicit categorization and labelling.",10
1197,Are they based on some notion of ‘inherent’ differences?,10
1198,In other words do they assume that biological or cultural categories are unproblematic?,10
1199,"Do they suggest a neat and straightforward relationship between biology, culture and differential educational needs?",10
1200,Why and how are these categories used?,10
1201,"Most educationalists, teachers and politicians probably accept that there is no biological basis for the notion of ‘race’.",10
1202,"Nineteenth century ‘scientific racism’, with its discrete, hierarchical and inherited categories has been significantly challenged, not eliminated, from popular consciousness.",10
1203,"Ancestral origins from different geographical regions, however, are still assumed to be important in understanding pupil needs.",10
1204,"‘Asians’ and ‘West Indians’, , are labelled by their country of origin, even those third or fourth generation resident in this country.",10
1205,"They are commonly referred to as belonging to different ‘races’, and the relations between Asian and West Indian communities and the white British population are referred to as ‘race relations’(cf the Race Relations Act).",10
1206,"There is, however, little recognition of the cultural origins of such terminology.",10
1207,"We conveniently forget that these divisions and the classification of people as ‘races’, have been historically and politically created.",10
1208,"Indeed in post-1945 Britain it is the political creation and solidification of such categories, enshrined, , in legislation for immigration control, which provides one crucial context within which educational policies emerge (see Sivanandan 1982, Carby 1982, Troyna and Williams 1986).",10
1209,"How, then, has the acceptance and understanding of racial differences been perpetuated and built into policy discussions during the past 40 years?",10
1210,"The most obvious way, clearly demonstrated in educational literature, has been to associate the label ‘race’ with some notion of cultural unity, encapsulated in the term .",10
1211,"It has become commonplace in educational debates to assert that schools should reflect cultural differences, that the divisions within the school population are cultural ones, represented in different ethnic identities.",10
1212,The confusion between the labels ‘race’ and ethnicity allows an outmoded biological determinism to be replaced by an implicit cultural determinism.,10
1213,"Each ethnic group is portrayed as homogeneous and possessing a culture that is fixed, static and unrelated to the changing social and economic circumstances of their lives.",10
1214,If we are not very careful black and white children in schools are seen as a different education simply the culture they are expected to belong to.,10
1215,But we must question which cultural attributes define groups of people as different.,10
1216,How homogeneous is the culture of white children?,10
1217,How fast are the cultures of different black groups changing?,10
1218,How can schools reflect cultural differences without reinforcing the notion that those differences are unchanging and inherent in particular groups.,10
1219,"A very similar discussion concerning the need for educational reform takes place round the notion of , though frequently in a less explicit and straightforward form.",10
1220,Again we can ask whether the special needs of girls are attributed to their biology or to a notion of femaleness which implies some form of cultural unity?,10
1221,"Gender has been used historically as a basis of the organization of educational provision, whether separate schools or separate curricula (David, 1980).",10
1222,It was seen as the most ‘natural’ division given the separate roles of men and women in society.,10
1223,"Biological differences were seen to give rise to different needs, interests and abilities.",10
1224,"Cultural differences resulting from the division of labour into productive and domestic forms provided a commonsense justification for separate educational provision, focusing for girls on child care and domestic science.",10
1225,Gender divisions were an obvious and convenient division for teachers to use and one that was not contentious during most of the twentieth century.,10
1226,During the 1970s and 1980s the problem became redefined.,10
1227,"For some feminists the ‘problem’ was the masculine culture of mixed schools, which made them problematic for girls (Spender and Sarah, 1980).",10
1228,Within this framework one solution is to incorporate some aspects of the less valued ‘female’ culture into the curricula.,10
1229,"‘Femaleness’ has been used by radical feminists as a justification for more co-operative, less competitive forms of learning, these were inherent in all female cultures.",10
1230,"One justification, therefore, for using ‘race’ and sex as significant divisions is that these designate important cultural differences as educationally relevant.",10
1231,"Unfortunately, it also encourages the use of a concept of culture which is highly problematic, particularly when used in policy discussions.",10
1232,"An alternative classification, used by some researchers and policy makers, is that which distinguishes pupils on the basis of some aspect of their social and educational experiences.",10
1233,It is suggested that the way women and black citizens are treated in society and in schools provides for a unity among female students on the one hand and black students on the other.,10
1234,Such experiences are summarized in the terms racism and sexism.,10
1235,"The ILEA documents (1983, 1985) provide a clear example of this alternative approach.",10
1236,New educational policies take their justification from the experiences of racism suffered by black citizens.,10
1237,"There are certain routine practices, customs and procedures in our society whose consequence is that black people have poorer jobs, health, housing, education and life chances than do the white majority.",10
1238,"(1983, p. 6)",10
1239,"Similarly, girls and women suffer from living in a society in which sexism",10
1240,is based on and perpetuates a notion of male superiority.,10
1241,Greater value and  status is more often given to traditional male pursuits and occupations than female ones.,10
1242,"This places men generally in a position of power over women, whether at home, at work or through the political, social and economic systems and institutions which govern our lives.",10
1243,"(1985, p. 4)",10
1244,"ILEA also brings the issue of race and gender together by stating that ‘sex and race inequalities are linked through the experience of discrimination, prejudice, stereotyping and powerlessness’(1985, p. 5).",10
1245,"A whole range of examples of sexism within education are given, including textbook biases, differential teacher expectations concerning pupil abilities, differential teacher behaviour discipline and attention, sexual harassment, assumptions concerning the leadership qualities of males and the monopolization of power by males.",10
1246,"This list is mirrored very clearly in discussions concerning racism in schools, where equivalent differential experiences can be found.",10
1247,All aspects of education are included and the experiences of black and female pupils are seen to be qualitatively different from that of white male pupils.,10
1248,"That males and whites are not homogeneous groups, and that many school experiences are similar for all students tends to be ignored.",10
1249,As Lynn Davies (1978) graphically puts it:,10
1250,"it is rather like highlighting the lion's view of captivity, it implies that this is demonstrably different from the tiger's view, and this draws attention the significant fact of captivity.",10
1251,(p. 103),10
1252,"By focusing on particular school experiences, crucial though they are, other differentiating variables tend to be ignored.",10
1253,", during the 1950s and 1960s social class inequalities access to different forms of education, in educational experiences and in educational achievements were documented in sociological studies and Government reports.",10
1254,"But recent educational research initiated, or selected as deserving attention, by policy makers rarely allows for ethnic or gender issues to be placed within a social class context.",10
1255,"The presentation of educational data, which forms the justification for most policies, is documented in discrete and unrelated forms.",10
1256,"In ILEA (1983), , social class, sex and ‘racial’ achievements in education are documented in separate sections.",10
1257,The relationships between the three sets of data are hardly explored.,10
1258,"Few references are made to the social class distribution of West Indian and Asian parents found in other studies, and no supporting evidence is offered for the following statement:",10
1259,our ILEA studies suggest that only about half the difference between reading scores of children from West Indian homes and their white counterparts may be accounted for by socio-economic factors.,10
1260,(p. 17),10
1261,There are suggestions that the differences the group labelled Asian are large but here again no details are provided.,10
1262,"The Rampton Report (1981) had used the same processes of data collection and presentation, comparing only overarching ethnic categories West Indian, Asian and White with no discussion of sex differences within each.",10
1263,receiving sharp criticism of this practice from researchers Reeves and Chevannes (1981) the Swann Committee repeated this model of data collection.,10
1264,Research by Craft and Craft (1983) which includes a division between middle and working-class black groups is reported in Swann (p. 60) but little interpretive use is made of these data.,10
1265,"What must always have been clear to perceptive teachers, and what is now being documented in some detail in research, is that racism and sexism are experienced in numerous different ways, depending upon the groups concerned and the educational context.",10
1266,"Clarricoates (1980), , illustrates the relationship between different constructions of masculinity and  within the classroom and the social class composition of the school catchment areas.",10
1267,"Lynn Davies (1984) describes the ways in which, within one largely working-class comprehensive school, differing versions of femininity interrelate with differing levels of academic achievement.",10
1268,"Racism, similarly, is a complex phenomenon.",10
1269,"Not only does the level of racist abuse or harassment vary in different schools and localities, but teacher stereotypes and the labelling of black children vary pupil, age, social class, and the demographic distribution of ethnic minority groups.",10
1270,"The responses of black students to these different forms of racism have been shown to result in a range of black male and female identities in different settings (see, , Fuller, 1982; Riley, 1985; Brah and Minhas, 1985).",10
1271,"Initial research suggests, , that black students in Further Education colleges may view education in a utilitarian manner, placing more emphasis upon the credentials available within FE than upon their culturally specific or anti-racist provision (FEU, 1985a; Reeves, 1986).",10
1272,"Such research emphasizes the importance of defining the experiences of black and female students as multi-faceted, of documenting how they perceive and respond to racism and sexism within society and education in many different ways.",10
1273,This section has raised two questions concerning pupil categorizations implicit in certain policy developments.,10
1274,The first question concerns the basis of the categorizations.,10
1275,"Do policies which focus on girls or black pupils imply, even unwittingly, a biological or cultural unity among females or ethnic minority groups?",10
1276,"If this is so, what are the implications of this for practice in schools?",10
1277,The second question concerns the extent to which it is possible and desirable to prevent an oversimplification of the divisions created and reinforced within education.,10
1278,"Colour, ethnic and gender divisions interweave with social class and achievement hierarchies in different ways in different geographical areas and institutional contexts.",10
1279,How can this complexity be acknowledged when policies are formulated?,10
1280,‘Race’ and Gender as Educational Problems,10
1281,"Built into most policy development over the past four decades, even anti-sexist and anti-racist initiatives, has been the assumption that girls and black pupils are ‘problems’; that they either have problems or pose problems that  are different from other groups of pupils.",10
1282,"In this section I intend to focus on the way four of these problems have become interlinked, namely those of underachievement, the concern over indiscipline, and the need for social integration and the employability of particular groups.",10
1283,Each of these themes can be found in ‘race’ and gender debates illustrating very clearly both the similarities and differences in the way these pupil groups are defined as educational problems.,10
1284,The ‘problem’ of underachievement illustrates this particularly well.,10
1285,As far as female students are concerned:,10
1286,Statistics show that girls' academic achievement is as good as boy's' and that more girls than boys are entered for all levels of public examinations.,10
1287,The relative position of girls and boys becomes sharply divided only when we look at two factors behind the generalized statistics:(1) subject choices;(2) post-school experiences.,10
1288,"(ILEA, 6, p. 5)",10
1289,These two aspects of gender differences provide the context within which policy makers frame the discussion of female educational experience and achievement.,10
1290,", attention is focused on girls' differential engagement with, and performance in, certain scientific and technical subjects (see, , The Further Education Unit, 1985b; The Schools Council Project on Reducing Sex Differentiation in Schools, 1983; Brent LEA, 1982).",10
1291,"The Girls into Science and Technology and Girls into Craft, Design and Technology projects and the DES (Orr, 1985) all focused their attention on female subject choice and career aspirations.",10
1292,"The MSC in both the YTS and TVEI programmes takes the view that the perpetuation of sex differentiated subject and skill areas is a major problem, in those areas where there is a shortage of skilled male labour.",10
1293,At the level of rhetoric much concern has been expressed about female underachievement the reference is generally to the experiences of white girls.,10
1294,"Underachievement, however, means something rather different when the focus of educational concern is black pupils.",10
1295,"Here the issue is one of general educational failure, as measured, , by reading age, CSE and O level passes, entrance to Higher Education, etc. (see, , Little, 1975; Tomlinson, 1986; Rampton, 1979; ILEA, 1983; Swann, 1985).",10
1296,"The research which underpins current understanding of black underachievement, and the political and professional reinterpretation of it, rests upon ethnic categorizations.",10
1297,‘West Indians’ are grouped together and contrasted with ‘Asians’and ‘Whites’.,10
1298,"Avoiding a black/white categorization which might have revealed the impact of racism, this oversimplified ethnic categorization results in an association  black educational underachievement and a notion of ‘West Indianness’.",10
1299,The two frames of reference within which the problems of female and black underachievement are located therefore are quite different.,10
1300,The central issue for girls is one of employability within a changing job market where there are specific skill shortages and taken-for-granted assumptions concerning future  labour demands.,10
1301,"‘Science’ and ‘technology’cover a very wide range of occupations, and in practice policy makers may have little idea of either the extent of skill shortages or how to redirect girls' energies towards these.",10
1302,"Nevertheless, arguments about the current failure of schools are put forward; :",10
1303,"by still preparing many school girls for a sheltered life with the emphasis upon ‘suitable’ female skills we may ‘educate for incapability’— , for frustration, unemployment and second-class citizenship in a technological society.",10
1304,"(FEU, 1985b, p. 16)",10
1305,Here the imagery of traditional female occupations contrasted with high status technology is representative of most of the policy documents of gender inequality in education.,10
1306,"The passivity and conformity of girls, their lack of assertiveness and ambition, their refusal to study ‘hard’, rational subjects are defined as the problem.",10
1307,"From such a perspective girls frequently appear as victims of the sexism in education apparent to others (Brah and Deem, 1986).",10
1308,"On the other hand, girls' lack of femininity or their ‘masculinity’ may be seen as more of a problem than that of underachievement.",10
1309,"Girls' subject choices, their lack of competition with boys, their restricted career choices, etc. can be interpreted as self chosen, rational (misguided) responses to the position of women in society.",10
1310,"In contrast, the problem of black underachievement is almost never interpreted in this manner.",10
1311,"The relationship of underachievement with employability is constructed through an assumption that it is the lack of academic achievement which renders black students unemployable (Scarman, 1981).",10
1312,"Black pupils need to achieve academically to enter the labour market even at the lowest level evidence that qualifications do not necessarily lead to jobs (see Brennan and McGeevor, 1987, ).",10
1313,"The concept of black underachievement provides an even greater contrast when it is associated with ‘trouble’, defined as indiscipline and truanting, and results in suspensions and local ‘law and order’ problems.",10
1314,"Teacher assumptions concerning the classroom problems exhibited by ‘West Indian’ students have been documented for the past 20 years (Brittain, 1976; Rampton, 1981).",10
1315,"Key statements in many LEA policy documents show a concern for ‘harmony’ and ‘stability’, which is never the case in sex equality policies or statements on girls' education.",10
1316,"It is significant that most formal policies on ‘race’ and multicultural education have been formulated after 1981 when the ‘riots’forced the issue of inner city youth on the political agenda (Troyna and Williams, 1986; Solomos, 1986a).",10
1317,"Since the 1950s an association between low school attainment, the problems of classroom discipline, and delinquency has been accepted as a male, white and predominantly working class phenomenon.",10
1318,"Now the problems of black male youths in schools have adapted and adopted this ‘law and order’ language, and its associated imagery of violence, discontent and public  concern (Fisher and Joshua, 1982).",10
1319,"One consequence of this scenario is that black underachievement is portrayed as meaningless, destructive and irrational (Solomos, 1986b).",10
1320,"In contrast with the analysis of female underachievement, there appears to be a refusal to even consider that black underachievement (and disruption) could be a collective, rational, response to a discriminatory social system (John, 1981 is an exception).",10
1321,"It is quite clear from these contrasting analyses of underachievement, employability and disruption, that the differential experiences of black girls are given minimal attention.",10
1322,"Stereotypes associated with black girls have been constructed along ethnic lines, and cut across the more general male/female, black/white images (see Allen, 1982; Carby, 1982; Brah and Minhas, 1986; Riley, 1986).",10
1323,"As Brah and Deem point out, Afro-Caribbean young women are stereotyped as ‘pushy’, but achieve better in schools than their male counterparts.",10
1324,"Asian young women are seen as passive, meek, ruthlessly oppressed by their families (1986, p. 73), not being allowed to take courses and jobs commensurate with their abilities and achievement.",10
1325,Such overgeneralizations are clearly ridiculous.,10
1326,What they highlight very sharply is the importance of very careful scrutiny of the ways in which girls and black pupils are portrayed as problems.,10
1327,Explanations of Educational Problems,10
1328,"to gain acceptance for their interpretation of educational problems, researchers, administrators and politicians usually find it necessary to ‘explain' the problem; to pinpoint the processes which appear to have led to it in such a way as to make the remedy appear obvious.",10
1329,In other words there is little pay off in providing an explanation which implies nothing can be done.,10
1330,(The term ‘academic’ is often used as a pejorative label to describe such explanations.),10
1331,"Interestingly, the accepted explanations for the problems that female and black pupils pose for schools, and the suggested remedies, are remarkably similar.",10
1332,They follow earlier frameworks developed to explain social class disparities in educational achievements which are summarized by Flude (1974) as (i) cultural deficit (ii) cultural difference (iii) teacher labelling and stereotyping and (iv) discrimination.,10
1333,I shall very briefly consider each set of explanations ‘race’ and gender.,10
1334,(i) Cultural deficit theories,10
1335,"Very many educational reports over the past few decades have portrayed black pupils as having special needs because their cultural background is inadequate (e.g. Rampton Report, 1981).",10
1336,Examples may focus on differences in the structure of their language or parental relationships or the lack of parental knowledge of child development.,10
1337,"Schools, therefore, are expected to compensate for these supposed deficits.",10
1338,"Interestingly, anti-racist proposals very often assume whites suffer from a cultural deficit, i.e. from racist attitudes which are simply a legacy from imperialism and colonialism (Swann Report, 1985); an  unfortunate ignorance which schools can remedy.",10
1339,"Lyn Yates (1985) suggests that this type of deficit approach, which in effect blames the victim, is also the most common approach to girls' schooling.",10
1340,"Teachers are asked to develop an alternative female culture of achievement and independence which will compensate for the romanticism, dependency and passivity found amongst women in society.",10
1341,Theories of compensatory education rest on certain important assumptions.,10
1342,"First, deficit cultures are portrayed as irrational, as based on ignorance.",10
1343,"There is little, if any, analysis of why particular attitudes and behaviours have developed, of the ways in which cultures are related to and continuously reinforced by the wider structural position of particular groups; the ways in which cultures can be a rational response to the social position of groups at a particular time.",10
1344,"Secondly, a change in the overt and hidden curriculum is presented as a solution which will lead to changed attitudes and behaviours, other changes outside the control of the school.",10
1345,(ii) Cultural difference theories,10
1346,Notions of cultural deficits frequently have been replaced by an emphasis upon differences with apparently no pejorative connotations.,10
1347,"It is argued that cultural discontinuities between homes and schools do exist, are inevitable and are to be celebrated.",10
1348,This results in an explanation of gender and ‘race’ problems in schools teachers' inability to use these cultural differences.,10
1349,Teachers lack the skills necessary to incorporate and transform ethnic or gender cultures into a form which is educationally relevant.,10
1350,"The solution, again, is to retrain teachers, to enable them to understand, interpret and incorporate cultural differences which do exist into their teaching and to reflect these back to pupils in a way which leads to high achievement and satisfaction within schooling.",10
1351,Again the relationship  curriculum and culture is oversimplified.,10
1352,Which aspects of black or female cultures are or could be incorporated into high status knowledge?,10
1353,"Some black and female writers can be brought into English literature classes, or O or A level Punjabi can be developed, but other aspects can just as easily reinforce low academic status and perpetuate differences and segregation.",10
1354,"Classes on child care, personal health and beauty or African music are currently only likely to be options for those with few alternative examination subjects.",10
1355,"We must therefore question very carefully indeed why schools should, and how they could, reflect the different cultures of the local community.",10
1356,(iii) Teacher labelling and stereotyping,10
1357,"In the third explanatory framework, teachers' attitudes their knowledge are described as crucial.",10
1358,"Teachers' expectations, stereotyping and labelling are seen as the mechanisms which membership of an ethnic or gender group results in ethnic or sex disparities in achievements or in particular types of classroom behaviour.",10
1359,The Rampton Report argued:,10
1360,"that teachers had stereotyped or patronising attitudes towards West Indian children which, when combined with negative views of their academic ability and potential, may prove a self-fulfilling prophecy.",10
1361,"(1981, p. 70)",10
1362,Stanworth documented very clearly the differentiated assumptions which teachers held about male and female pupils including:,10
1363,"the implicit assumption that girls' capacities for efficiency and initiative will be channelled into nurturant or subordinate occupations, into other, less traditional, spheres.",10
1364,"(1981, pp. 30–31)",10
1365,"The solution, again, focuses upon re-educating teachers, to reduce if not remove racial and sex stereotypes.",10
1366,Discrimination,10
1367,The final explanatory framework is quite different.,10
1368,"It pinpoints direct and indirect discrimination both within and outside education (Wright, 1984; Spender, 1982).",10
1369,"The labels, racism and sexism, are used as summary terms for a very wide range of attitudes, behaviours and institutional processes which result in unequal access to material resources and personal dignity and choices.",10
1370,"Remedial policies again tend to focus upon the school, upon unintentional and institutional discrimination within education.",10
1371,"But there are attempts to link educational examples with key political and economic processes in the wider society, the institutionalization of racism within the Nationality Acts, with the differential occupational recruitment of women and black pupils, or the lack of child care provision which limits the realistic achievement of female career options.",10
1372,Thus the remodelling of teachers and schools is linked to wider social and political changes.,10
1373,‘Race’ and Gender Policies,10
1374,"Stemming from the differing interpretations of the educational problems posed by black and female pupils outlined in the previous section, a range of alternative policies may be introduced into schools.",10
1375,"In this article I shall only be able to illustrate the policy consequences of the fourth interpretation, that of discrimination.",10
1376,Most LEAs and schools that have introduced explicit policies to combat sexual and ‘racial’ inequalities label them as anti-racist and anti-sexist.,10
1377,The following table illustrates a range of initiatives which occur in schools.,10
1378,"Though in this form the list looks a long one, it must be remembered that only a limited number of schools have introduced more than a few changes.",10
1379,"It is possible to distinguish three, slightly different, elements within anti-racist and anti-sexist policies.",10
1380,A linked range of innovations focus on white racism   or male sexism and so introduce school policies which attempt to overcome racist and sexist attitudes and beliefs.,10
1381,A second type of development sets whole school policies within a wider framework which encompasses the needs and rights of parents and local community groups.,10
1382,The emergence of a set of strategies which encompass the whole institution can be developed at the same time as local links and local issues are given some priority.,10
1383,The third focus sets particular inequalities inside schools within the context of unequal life chances and access to resources generally.,10
1384,The issue of power brings a thread of coherence to what appear to be divergent reforms.,10
1385,"Teachers, pupils, parents and community groups all need access to power.",10
1386,"An inspection of the table reveals overlaps between the three trends, and clearly they should not be seen as mutually exclusive.",10
1387,The table simply illustrates the range of policies which have been introduced.,10
1388,It is a useful exercise to look in detail at a particular school with which one is familiar and ask how much of current practice would have to change for the policies listed to be implemented.,10
1389,"Could they be introduced as token, surface changes or do they necessitate a fundamental reorganization of the way the school operates?",10
1390,Comparison of Anti-sexist and anti-racist Policies,10
1391,On the surface anti-racist and anti-sexist educational policies are in tune with .,10
1392,"The early anti-racist initiatives of the 1960s and 70s were school based and developed by teachers drawing their strength and legitimacy from both their professionalism and their identification with local community issues (e.g. ALTARF, 1980, 1984).",10
1393,"Anti-sexist initiatives were also likely to be ‘bottom-up’ developments initially (Taylor, 1985).",10
1394,"However, by the early 1980s some LEAs began to adopt more prescriptive approaches, insisting on school policies fostering racial equality within given time limits (e.g. ILEA, Brent), prescribing aspects of headteacher behaviour to ethnic minority parents (e.g. Bradford), making certain forms of racist behaviour a disciplinary offence (e.g. Manchester) or establishing central mechanisms to decide upon school suspensions and so removing power from Heads and Governors (e.g. Birmingham).",10
1395,"Similarly a few LEAs stepped up pressure on schools to implement anti-sexist policies, asking for school policies within a particular time limit (e.g. Brent, ILEA) pressuring heads to implement change; organizing inservice courses (Humberside, Brent) replacing text books and appointing Advisers/Inspectors.",10
1396,"There are, however, quite important differences of emphasis.",10
1397,"There appears to be far more concern in anti-racist policies to alter the behaviour and attitudes of white personnel, compared with the attention devoted to altering male behaviour in schools.",10
1398,"In contrast, the issue of separate provision is suggested by anti-sexist policies, which might prioritize the creation of girls-only classes, women-run support groups, assertiveness training, etc.",10
1399,"(Weiner, 1985).",10
1400,It is not a usual part of anti-racist strategies to create black only classes  within ordinary schools to prevent unfair competition with white pupils who get more than their share of teacher attention.,10
1401,Black pupils are given more attention by teachers only discipline and punishment.,10
1402,"Black teacher groups are becoming more common, and supplementary schools exist in many cities, but support groups for black students within schools are not usually on the list of policy priorities.",10
1403,"Also whilst Women's Studies, particularly in Higher Education, appears to have achieved a certain respectability and is flourishing, Black Studies is on the decline and receives little public support from those concerned about racism.",10
1404,", there is no clear anti-racist equivalent of girl-centred schooling, or indeed girl-friendly schooling (see Weiner, 1986 for the distinction between these two approaches).",10
1405,"The creation of specialist hierarchies of teacher advisers, curriculum centres and school working parties is common to both policy arenas.",10
1406,But again certain differences are clear.,10
1407,"Sex equality policies are not widespread, yet they do relate to mainstream education practice and funding: policies concerned to alter ordinary timetabling processes, counselling systems and resource allocation.",10
1408,"The Technical and Vocational Educational Initiative, a nationally funded, vocationally oriented programme, has been able to incorporate some anti-sexist aspects as part of its normal aims and activities, the implementation of these aims is limited.",10
1409,"In contrast, Section 11 grants available since 1966 to some authorities to provide funding for the special needs of ethnic minority pupils, have tended to marginalize spending on black pupils.",10
1410,The existence of this funding has been the key factor in LEAs' development of specialist appointments and experimental initiatives.,10
1411,"The effect on mainstream education and ordinary professional practice has been minimal (Troyna and Ball, 1985).",10
1412,Single-sex schooling is clearly an issue within the state sector of education.,10
1413,"Although the numbers of single sex schools have declined dramatically during the past three decades, girls-only schools have been supported as a desirable alternative to  in some LEAs.",10
1414,Political campaigns have been organized to preserve existing single sex schools when under the threat of closure.,10
1415,In contrast most debates concerning black schools have centred upon voluntary supplementary schools or private religious provision (with one or two exceptions).,10
1416,"As far as official policies are concerned, assumptions concerning integration have been based on the acceptance of white majority schools as both normal and desirable.",10
1417,"Demands for some form of separatism on grounds of religion, , have been perceived as a threat to mainstream education (see Ball, 1986; Swann, 1985).",10
1418,"When particular ethnic groups have campaigned to preserve single sex schools, compatibility with  norms, this has been perceived as a form of cultural imposition and indoctrination and even sexism.",10
1419,"Thus separate schooling for white girls, while not generally accepted, is seen as a legitimate demand, linked with high academic achievements, and mainstream educational issues.",10
1420,"When such demands become part of a debate concerning black issues, it is marginalized and perceived as a threat to harmony and integration.",10
1421,Conclusions: Policy Rhetoric and Structural Realities,10
1422,In this article I have tried to tease out the underlying assumptions of educational policies concerned with ‘race’ and gender.,10
1423,Two particular themes have guided the analysis.,10
1424,The first is an exploration of the language of explanation and the language of reform and policy change through which particular educational issues come to be debated and understood.,10
1425,The second theme concerns the similarities and differences in these understandings when focused upon ‘race’ and upon gender.,10
1426,I have tried to show where explanations and policies are similar and where the rhetoric of analysis reflects similar concerns; but also where there are deep and crucial differences.,10
1427,"I have suggested that official LEA policies on ‘race’ and gender reflect and contain similar kinds of rhetoric; significantly local policies in both areas have ignored social class inequalities, and have both tended to isolate education from wider debates concerning inequalities.",10
1428,Policies on ‘race’ and gender often work within a compensatory model of education.,10
1429,"Both also work with polarized categories, black/white, male/ female, which by implication if not design, make other forms of inequality acceptable.",10
1430,"Thus at this level of problem analysis, of political and administrative policy formation, anti-sexist and anti-racist initiatives appear to mirror .",10
1431,"However, behind this surface similarity lie the deeper conflicts and contradictions which have been illustrated earlier.",10
1432,"These differences are inevitable given the distinct economic, political and professional contexts of such policy formation.",10
1433,"both black and female workers are recruited to the unskilled or semi-skilled area of the economy and are currently suffering high levels of unemployment, particularly among the younger age groups.",10
1434,But the similarities must not be overgeneralized and the differences need to be acknowledged.,10
1435,there is a higher chance of a white woman attaining professional or executive position (on the lower rungs and with less promotion chances than white men) than a black person of either sex.,10
1436,Sex segregation in the labour market is remarkably resistant to change and most women are channelled into ‘appropriate’ areas.,10
1437,"But these appropriate areas cover the social class range of occupations, socially and educationally ambitious girls can be accommodated, initially.",10
1438,"‘There is ample literature to demonstrate that qualified women have not attained full equality with men, but nonetheless they do have considerable economic and occupational advantages compared with less qualified women’(Bonney, 1986, p. 17).",10
1439,"It is later in their careers, when seeking promotion, that direct and indirect discrimination becomes more visible, and women's domestic position impinges most directly on occupational participation, and the monopolization of power by men is starkly evident.",10
1440,"In contrast, discrimination against black students occurs at the initial entry  stage into the labour market.",10
1441,"The concentration of black workers within manual occupations is being consolidated eroded (Newnham, 1986).",10
1442,"The association of colour with particular low status, low paid occupations continues with generations born in this country (see the Swann Report, 1985, Ch. 15 on Liverpool's blacks, ).",10
1443,"The quite different nature of the female labour market means that it is easier to introduce measures in schools and colleges which will improve the initial occupational choices of some female students, particularly middle class or ‘academically able’ girls.",10
1444,The changing labour market and economic structures therefore allow a certain ‘space’ for gender reforms even within an overall operation which reinforces existing patterns.,10
1445,The nature of this ‘space’ is much more limited for black students.,10
1446,"Attempts to improve occupational mobility for them may concentrate on a few professional openings where their colour is defined as an occupational advantage (e.g. race relations advisers) or on employers (e.g. local authorities) with positive action policies, or self-employment (small businesses).",10
1447,Another major factor we need to consider for black citizens in the UK is the way in which black groups have been defined politically over the past four decades.,10
1448,Their presence in this country and the meaning of their citizenship is continually questioned.,10
1449,The Nationality Acts and the revision of entry rules and procedures perpetuate the association between blackness and ‘alien invaders’ bringing unnecessary social problems with them.,10
1450,"Finally, and briefly, the professional contexts within which policies are generated and implemented differ.",10
1451,"There are clearly far more women teachers than black teachers, some in influential positions, yet promotion remains limited and the working environment is controlled by men.",10
1452,"Therefore it is in women teachers' own interests, those of their female pupils to initiate or support anti-sexist reforms.",10
1453,"In a recent study of all Higher Education Institutions it has become quite clear that the main impetus towards Equal Opportunity Policies has come from female members of staff or particular unions representing female members (CRE, unpublished).",10
1454,"This is certainly not to argue that all female professionals are active in anti-sexist developments, or that implementation of policy is easy.",10
1455,"Many women teachers have faced strong opposition, even ridicule, when attempting to change school policies.",10
1456,"Rather the professional context again provides limited space where reforms can be articulated, particularly if their aim is to change one particular institution.",10
1457,"With so few black professionals in post, most pressure for anti-racist reforms has to come from a variety of sources, from white politicians or administrators or black pressure groups working in particular localities anti-racist teachers.",10
1458,"It is interesting to note the changing nature of anti-racist reforms and opposition to them when black professionals and politicians gain more influence in particular localities (Brent LEA, ).",10
1459,"Over most of the country, anti-racist reforms within schools have had to rely on the political commitment of white teachers.",10
1460,It is less likely that  any significant number of such staff will be persuaded that it is in their own interests to initiate sweeping reforms.,10
1461,"Widespread and gross inequalities and discrimination on the basis of colour and sex, and the beliefs which justify these activities, exist in society and in schools.",10
1462,Policies which address such issues are an urgent necessity.,10
1463,"Clearly pupils cannot be treated as identical, assumed to be already equal, racism and sexism did not exist.",10
1464,Yet the formulation and implementation of such policies is not an easy task.,10
1465,"A careful scrutiny of existing policies and their implicit and explicit assumptions should do two things; it should enable choices to be made at the level of general strategies, what is most conducive to equity or equality, it should also enable individual teachers in individual schools to compare their circumstances with those of others and learn which innovations seem to suit what circumstances and to take heart from the struggles and successes of their colleagues.",10
1,THE DEVELOPMENT OF DARWIN'S GENERAL BIOLOGICAL THEORIZING M.J.S. HODGE,11
2,"Charles Darwin (1809–1882) was only twenty seven when he returned, in 1836, from the five-year voyage of HMS .",11
3,"What is more, within the next five years he reached all those conclusions in general biological theory that his books were to expound three decades later.",11
4,"For, by 1841, he had worked out not only his theory of the origin of species,, but also, it seems, his theory of generation (or reproduction, including heredity, variation ),.",11
5,This chapter surveys the development of his general biological theorizing over that remarkable early period.,11
6,"The analysis draws throughout on the work done in the last decade by Gruber (1974), Herbert (1974, 1977), Ghiselin (1975), Ruse (1975a, b; 1979), Schweber (1977, 1980), Kottler (1978), Manier (1978), Sulloway (1979, 1982a, b), Kohn (1980), Ospovat (1981), and Sloan (1983a, b) and is derived from studies by the present writer (Hodge, 1982, 1986; Hodge & Kohn, 1986) where full reference is made to the documentary sources and secondary literature.",11
7,"Such a survey can serve more than mere biographical curiosity, and a final section will suggest how it may clarify some issues of current interest to historians, to philosophers and to biologists.",11
8,It can also free us from many mistaken myths about Darwin himself.,11
9,"These myths mostly trace to his own misleading reminiscences later in life, and have been relentlessly reaffirmed since, at the 1959 centennial symposia and in the 1978 BBC-TV series on Darwin; but they are nonetheless discredited by the scholarly industry now grown up around the rich manuscript archive from Darwin's early years (Kohn, 1986).",11
10,"One is the romantic, really Wordsworthian, individualist myth so dear to the literary guardians of English national cultural stereotypes.",11
11,"It depicts the young Darwin as a lone, sporting gentleman, an amateur beetle-collector  seeing nature as she really is by simply looking with the clear gaze of genius, unimpeded by any scientific training, theological prejudice, professional ambition .",11
12,"Another is the Whiggish, anachronistic myth that Darwin's general biological thought consists of a molecule comprising just two atoms: the idea of evolution and the idea of natural selection.",11
13,"It depicts his early intellectual development as reducing to two moments of discovery, whereby he moves from having no coherent ideas to having just those ideas.",11
14,"Fortunately, there is a single antidote effective against both these myths;, and that is to start all over again with the most decisive source of Darwin's new identity, on the voyage, as a committed man of science: his zealous discipleship of Charles Lyell's (1797–1875) views in geology (including biogeography and ecology).",11
15,"This antidote is effective against the romantic-individualist myth, because, as a protégé of Lyell, the young Darwin of the is invested with all the intellectual and institutional context that that myth would suppress.",11
16,"It is effective against the evolution-plus-natural-selection myth, because it forces us to reconstruct the narrative of his subsequent theorizing not as so many unknowing steps towards his final positions, but as so many deliberate departures from positions initially shared with his mentor.",11
17,Darwin as a protégé of Lyell (1834–7),11
18,Darwin's acceptance of Lyell's views was complete by mid-1834 when he sailed around the Horn.,11
19,"Having now studied all three volumes of the (1830–3), he was applying Lyell's entire system, physical and organic worlds alike, to South America and beyond that the whole earth.",11
20,Henceforth this system provided the framework for his preoccupation with the problems of the extinction and origin of species.,11
21,"All the causes of change are presumed, in Lyell's system, to persist undiminished into the present, the human period, and on into the future.",11
22,"Now, as at all times, habitable dry land is being destroyed by subsidence and erosion in some regions, while it is being produced by sediment consolidation, lava eruption and elevationary earthquake action in others.",11
23,"Equally, Lyell has the long succession of faunas and floras brought about by a continual, one-by-one extinction of species and their replacement by new ones.",11
24,"The epistemological rationale for his presumption, of the persistence of all such causes of change into the present and future, is the ideal of  explanation by real or existing causes,.",11
25,"Like his friend (and the undergraduate Darwin's scientific hero) the physicist John Herschel (1792–1871), Lyell followed earlier writers, most notably the Scottish philosopher Thomas Reid (1710–1796), who had drawn this moral from the superior evidential credentials of the Newtonian gravitational force over the Cartesian ethereal vortices: any causes invoked in an explanatory theory should, ideally, be known to exist through direct observation independently of the facts they are supposed to explain.",11
26,"That force, unlike those vortices, was a well-evidenced explanation for the planets' orbits because, the argument went, the orbits themselves were not the sole evidence for its existence.",11
27,It was a real not a conjectural cause; for it was known to exist from observations of swinging pendulums and falling stones down here on earth.,11
28,"Lyell's system was, therefore, to exemplify an epistemological analogy.",11
29,"In geology, only causes active in the present, human period are accessible in principle, although often not in practice, to direct observation.",11
30,"So, in this science, the present is to the past as the terrestrial is to the celestial in Newtonian physical astronomy.",11
31,"Such, then, was the context, systematic and epistemological wherein Darwin, from 1834 on, was theorizing about species extinctions and origins.",11
32,"His own thinking over the next three years was developed, accordingly, through successive disagreements with Lyell's views on the organic world, while he continued to accept his mentor's teaching on the physical world of land, sea and climate changes.",11
33,Lyell had made adaptational considerations alone completely decisive in determining the timing and placing of both species extinctions and species origins.,11
34,Any species must eventually become extinct; for changes in local conditions will sooner or later allow other species better adapted to the changed conditions to invade and conquer in the struggle for existence.,11
35,"species origins, Lyell had argued against spontaneous generation and against new species arising by the modification (‘transmutation’) of older ones.",11
36,"But, in offering no positive alternative account, he had left the means whereby new species originate quite mysterious if not miraculous.",11
37,"He had held explicitly, however, that when and where any given species is created is determined by the conditions it needs to flourish.",11
38,"Conversely, the character and so the supraspecific group membership of the species that have originated in any area is determined by conditions there.",11
39,"So, on Lyell's account, if two areas are very similar in conditions they will have congeneric or cofamilial endemic species; if they are very dissimilar, then their endemic species will be of distinct families or orders.",11
40,"Now, by early spring 1837, Darwin had decided that such purely adaptational explanations could not account adequately for the timing and placing of either the extinctions of old species or the origins of new ones.",11
41,"And he was emphasizing, in his , the parallel in the explanatory inadequacy of adaptation in the two cases (Herbert, 1980).",11
42,"Already, in 1835, he had concluded that several species of large mammals, formerly flourishing on the eastern plains of South America, had later become extinct while no change in conditions physical or ecological had occurred.",11
43,"And he had adopted another theory of extinction, discussed but rejected by Lyell, wherein species are like individuals and die of old age.",11
44,"A species, as a succession of organisms produced sexually, might have only a limited total lifetime, Darwin argued; just as a succession of apple trees propagated by grafts was supposed to last only so long before degenerating and dying it were merely the extension of a single limited life.",11
45,"the origin of species, reflection on many palaeontological and biogeographical facts, including those established by the expert judgments of Richard Owen and John Gould on the voyage material, had convinced Darwin, by early spring 1837, that the close similarity seen between any congeneric endemic species in two areas was not always explicable as a common adaptation to common conditions; for often the two sets of species were endemic in areas with very different climate, soil .",11
46,"However, if more recent species could descend from earlier ones, ancestry could explain what adaptation could not.",11
47,"Why did the species on younger land — the Galapagos islands or the southern Patagonian plains, — often resemble closely other species on the nearest older land?",11
48,"Because they were descended from them, many sometimes descending from a single ancestral species.",11
49,"Thus did Darwin conclude that resemblances between species are often not due to adaptation but to inheritance from common ancestors; while differences are often adaptive and are differing, multiple divergences from those common ancestors.",11
50,"It is not, as he saw it, that species are not exquisitely adapted to their respective places in the economy of nature.",11
51,They are and any theory of species origins must explain why.,11
52,It is simply that adaptation and ancestry can explain what adaptation alone can not.,11
53,"On such grounds Darwin had decided, by that spring, for transmutation and common descent.",11
54,"Always the bold ‘philosopher’ as much as the cautious ‘naturalist’, he soon went far beyond these disagreements with Lyell.",11
55,"He did so in a new sequence of theoretical notebooks, B-E (1837–9) and M- (1838–9)— M for ‘metaphysics’, meaning mind, man, materialism, morals .",11
56,(See  a note at the end of this chapter on editions of these texts.),11
57,"He did so, moreover, in two ways that were consciously conditioned from the start by his immediate context and resources in 1837 as a biological theorist.",11
58,"First, from way back in his Edinburgh days and his apprenticeship to Robert Grant in invertebrate zoology, he had been much pre-occupied with comprehensive generalizations about sexual and asexual modes of generation (Sloan, personal communication).",11
59,"His extinction theorizing had thus been developed, since 1835, at the first intersection of that old preoccupation with his newer devotion to Lyellian geology.",11
60,"Now, in the summer of 1837, he would understand the origins no less than the extinctions of species through appropriate comparisons and contrasts between sexual and asexual generation.",11
61,"Having read again a book he had admired when studying at Edinburgh, a book much concerned with precisely such comparisons and contrasts — his grandfather Brasmus Darwin's (1794–6)— he was soon taking its title for the opening heading of his , where he was now to pursue his own inquiry into ‘the laws of life’.",11
62,"He was soon making explicit, too, a fundamental teleological analogy, in which changing conditions are to sexual generation as sexual crossing is to asexual generation.",11
63,"Although it can extend an individual life, continued grafting eventually brings death without issue; and likewise sexual generation in unchanging conditions brings death, extinction of the species, without issue.",11
64,"With sexual crossing, however, an individual whose life has been extended by grafting, although not enabled to go on itself, can give rise to a new individual with a new lease on life.",11
65,"Likewise, then, in changing conditions, sexual generation is the providential means whereby a species can change into another, a new species adapted to the new conditions, so avoiding the extinction without issue that would otherwise occur.",11
66,"Second, Lyell had outlined very fully — and rejected — the comprehensive transmutationist system of biology developed by jean Lamarck, praising the French zoologist for his courage in extending his repugnant ideas to our own species, man.",11
67,"Darwin accordingly opened his , in July 1837, with an integrated sequence of entries whose twenty-seven pages of argumentation were to match the structure of Lyell's exposition of Lamarck.",11
68,"Darwin, like Lamarck — as presented (and misrepresented) by Lyell — would now trace any degrees of difference, wide, to long-run divergences from common stocks.",11
69,"And he would trace any higher levels of bodily organization and mental faculties, explicitly including those in man, to long-run progress from remote starting points in the simplest organisms of all, infusorian monads.",11
70,With these decisions Darwin became more than the protégé of Lyell.,11
71,He  would be ever hereafter his own successor in developing sequels to the steps he had taken in the spring and summer of 1837.,11
72,The new programme pursued (1837–8),11
73,"Darwin himself often reflected in his notebooks on his new programme's presuppositions concerning God, nature, man and science.",11
74,"God was, for Darwin then, still the traditional good and wise creator, but one never working in so many separate acts of miraculous interference, always through the natural consequences of a few initial enactments of general causal laws: as with planetary orbits and the law of gravitation, so, Darwin insisted, with species origins and the laws of generation.",11
75,"man, he is a species produced like any other, lawfully, his mental faculties the causal consequences of his bodily organization and not miraculously superadded; while science is a quest for lawful causes that are evidenced both directly and independently of the many, diverse facts they can explain, and indirectly and dependently, by the very multitude and diversity of those facts.",11
76,The place in the programme of his generational theory of species origins Darwin understood through the analogy of a tree of life.,11
77,"By the autumn of 1837, he had developed this analogy to understand all long-run trends in diversification and progress through an arboriform extrapolation, on a changing but stable Lyellian earth's surface, of successive species propagations; these being analogous to the successive bud propagations whereby any tree grows, with many buds ending without branching, in species extinctions, while other buds branch without ending, in species multiplications.",11
78,"His species propagation theorizing itself was accordingly constructed, from the very opening of , as an argument that starts with the sexual generation of one individual organism from another and ends with the propagation of one species from another.",11
79,"Moreover, this species propagation is ultimately made possible by the two features that Darwin sees distinguishing sexual from asexual generation: namely, maturation in the offspring and the interaction of two parents in their production.",11
80,"the impressionability of immature organization, hereditary adaptive variation accompanies sexual generation in changing conditions.",11
81,But how then can any species be constant in character across its entire range?,11
82,"Because crossing with the blending of parental characters keeps the species constant the conditions are constant overall, only changing temporarily and locally.",11
83,"Conversely, then, a new variety can be  formed if this conservative action of crossing is circumvented by reproductive isolation of a few individuals in new conditions, whether that isolation arises with or without geographical segregation.",11
84,And how may this variety formation proceed to new species formation.),11
85,"As Darwin knew, the usual criteria for specific mere varietal distinctions were those that Swedes and Italians do not satisfy, but lions and tigers do: namely, true breeding, lack of intermediate forms and unwillingness or inability to produce fertile hybrids on crossing.",11
86,"So, the final stage in Darwin's argumentation concerns how a species meeting those three criteria would eventually arise with prolonged isolation and divergence.",11
87,"Over the next year, through the summer of 1838, it is the variety and species formation stages of this argument that Darwin develops most fully and explicitly.",11
88,The character gaps between good species he explains by continued divergence and by the extinction of intermediate varieties.,11
89,The true breeding he explains by the law that in crossing the characters of an older domestic race dominate those of a younger one.,11
90,"This dominance shows, Darwin reasons, that older characters are more permanent, more deeply embedded in the hereditary constitution and so more resistant to the influence either of mates in crossing or of changing external conditions.",11
91,"Such permanent divergences in character have often arisen in the distinct races of a domesticated species, and in the wild they would be accompanied by an unwillingness or inability to interbreed; for there, Darwin argues, the reproductive system, with the associated instincts, is not disrupted as it is in domesticated species.",11
92,"So, for Darwin, in the early summer of 1838, the races of domesticated species are providing positive analogies, especially for the final, species formation, steps in his argument.",11
93,"But at the other, the opening end of that argument, concerning the initiation and transmission of adaptive change, they are a source of contrasts and not of comparison.",11
94,"Thus he says that many varieties of domesticated species, fancy pigeon breeds , are monstrous not adaptive; they can only be maintained by artificial feeding and breeding, including selective breeding; they are quite unlike wild, natural and adaptive varieties and even more unlike wild species.",11
95,"Now, as Darwin sees it, at this time, for a change to be an adaptation it must be more than merely hereditary and advantageous; it must be necessary accidental, elicited, , by the very conditions that make it advantageous, as albinism sometimes seems to be by cold.",11
96,"And it must be acquired by the whole of the race faced with those conditions, so as not to be lost in crossing.",11
97,"Then, as with reproductive isolation, changed habits can initiate permanent adaptive changes in structure, especially in higher animals by entailing changes in the conditions of foetal maturation.",11
98,"All these developments, in Darwin's comprehensive species propagation argumentation, are reinforced and not rejected in further developments, consummated in mid-September, 1838, in his conjectures about sexual and asexual generation, more particularly about sexual buds (or ova) and asexual buds.",11
99,"A sexual bud or ovum has started life, he supposes, as a bud from the mother when she was herself a newly fertilized egg in her mother, the grandmother.",11
100,Why then does it not eventually become an exact facsimile of that mother?,11
101,"Because, he answers, of two lots of differences.",11
102,During its maturation it is conditions not exactly like those the mother matured in; and at fertilization it is acted on by a mate with a constitution unlike its own and unlike its mother's.,11
103,"The whole object of sex is to have unlike acting on unlike to make possible the production of unlike offspring, thus allowing for adaptive change, Darwin argues.",11
104,But where does the constitutional unlikeness of the two mates come from?,11
105,"Well, since each has the same ancestry, their constitutional difference must trace to the cumulative influence of different conditions in the two lines of descent from those ancestors.",11
106,"So, sexual generation is the means whereby the past influences of changing conditions can be accumulated and combined with present ones to ensure continued variability.",11
107,"If conditions change only locally and temporarily then only individual differences will result, but, Darwin concludes, if conditions change overall and permanently then a new species will eventually be formed.",11
108,Darwin is pleased with this novel analysis of how sex enables new species to arise from old.,11
109,"But he admits that it leaves as mysterious as in 1837, how the maturation of the individual fertilized ovum ensures that the changes be adaptive in each generation.",11
110,He can only conjecture that additional maturational innovations will not become hereditary unless they harmonize with the previous ones that are already being recapitulated in maturation.,11
111,"Adaptive innovations could thus be separated, as the ones that are hereditarily transmitted, from the maladaptive, as the ones that are not; although Darwin notes that hereditary diseases show that this separation is often fallible.",11
112,Such is Darwin's species origin theorizing in mid-September 1838.,11
113,"It compounds still further those two legacies so actively conjoined since the  previous summer of 1837: the historical, biogeographical (including ecological) concerns that he had inherited from Lyell, and the generational concerns deriving from his study with Grant and subsequent reading in Erasmus Darwin.",11
114,"Consider, then, what geography and generation together have done for Darwin's understanding of the problems of organic diversity and the origin of species.",11
115,"First, his explanation of resemblances and differences among species contrasts directly with any developmental stage theorizing as found most famously in Robert Chambers, Herbert Spencer or Karl Marx.",11
116,A developmental stage theory refers similarities and differences to more-or-less-equal advances made from the lowest point on a universal scale of advance.,11
117,"Thus Chambers explains the similarities between Old and New World monkeys as life having advanced to the same level of organization from quite independent origins of life in the two hemispheres (Hodge, 1972).",11
118,"By contrast, for Darwin as a genealogical (ancestry and descent) theorist of historical biogeography, resemblances and differences are not traced to developmental advances, but to ramifying migrations and adaptive divergences from common ancestors that are more or less remote from their diverse descendants in time, place and character.",11
119,"Now, Darwin at this time is explicitly taking each organism's ontogeny to recapitulate its phylogeny.",11
120,"But his very assumption that many descendant species may diverge from a single common ancestry precludes his construing descendants as grown-up ancestors and ancestors as descendants in embryo; for any given immature, embryonic life already has but one determinate mature adult future; if a puppy as a dog, if a tadpole as a frog.",11
121,"It is, then, because he is explaining differences and resemblances as he is that Darwin, in 1838, needs a theory of purely opportunistic adaptive change in changing conditions, a theory making no developmentalist assumption a preferred direction that life will take provided it can go on .",11
122,And his thinking is indeed knowingly premised on the assumption that in the complete absence of change in conditions there would be no changes in organization; whatever different changes in organization have occurred in the many lines descending from some common stock are differences in the conditions in those lines.,11
123,"Darwin, as a genealogical biogeographer, thinking horizontally vertically, to use Ernst Mayr's (1982) terms, would explain change generationally but not developmentally.",11
124,"This integration of horizontal, genealogical, geographical and  generational constraints is also the source for what Ernst Mayr (1982) calls Darwin's populationist thinking about species.",11
125,"For it has led Darwin to think of each species as spreading out into varying conditions, over a range, over time.",11
126,"And only the extension of a species, not its intension, as philosophers say — only the collective membership of a species, not the properties earning the members their membership in it — can have a geographical range and a historical career.",11
127,"Now, recall his account of individual adaptations to conditions as arising in individual maturations in sexual generation; and recall his account of hereditary variation as embedded constitutionally through successive individual matings.",11
128,"And then it is clear how Darwin has come to be thinking of a species as a population of individuals, with each member differing from every other because arising in a unique sequence of influences exerted by a unique succession of conditions and mates.",11
129,The origins of natural selection and pangenesis (1838–42),11
130,"Darwin's mid-September 1838 theorizing, as developed in his , provided the immediate context for his most celebrated innovation of all: the theory of natural selection.",11
131,For — the legend that it was all thought through in a day — this theory was worked out in three main stages over the next half year.,11
132,The first stage involved only the opening steps in Darwin's overall argumentation from individual generation to species formation.,11
133,For it sees him changing his mind about the adaptiveness of structural change about species formation as such.,11
134,"This first stage did come on reading Thomas Malthus's (1766 — 1834)on 28 September 1838; after a generational conjecture — that higher animal foetuses are initially hermaphrodite — had led him to Adolphe Quetelet's findings on the sex ratio at birth and so, it seems, to Malthus as an author linked by a reviewer with the Belgian social statistician (Schweber, 1977).",11
135,"Now, what Darwin's reflections on Malthus did was to move him a prenatal, maturational sorting of adaptive from maladaptive variation.",11
136,"For he moved to a post-natal, ecological sorting wherein individual adaptive variants are retained, while the maladaptive are eliminated in the Malthusian crush of population.",11
137,"These initial reflections did not include, then, any analogy between artificially and naturally selective breeding.",11
138,"But Darwin did draw an explicit analogy between this teleology — of population pressure and  sorting, as ensuring adaptation of plant and animal structure to changing conditions — and Malthus's theistic teleology of superfecundity, as ensuing the energetic dispersal of ancient tribes beyond the original Asian seat of the human species.",11
139,"Man, naturally slothful Malthus, only spread into more adverse climes thanks to the local scarcities of food entailed by his excess fertility; with later settlers always eventually victorious because made doubly energetic in struggling with both rigorous conditions and previous settlers.",11
140,"Alien species beating natives on their home ground had been decisive for Lyell's species extinction theorising, where the analogy with the European human conquests over America Indians was explicit.",11
141,"Colonizing species of alien genera doing likewise had long been decisive for Darwin's species origin theorizing, where the analogy with the European human conquests over Australasian natives was hardly less explicit.",11
142,"Throughout 1838, Darwin had been allowing for Lyellian competitive defeats to extinguish some species before their predetermined ageing overcame them.",11
143,"Now, his Malthusian reflections prompted both a new ecological understanding of adaptive sorting and a final return to Lyellian ecology for all extinctions.",11
144,Thus did ecological explanations regain ground earlier lost to generational ones.,11
145,The second stage began around the end of November 1838.,11
146,"For Darwin then drew his first explicit analogies between adaptation in wild species and the fitness for human ends of domestic races, as both selective breeding.",11
147,"To make this new comparison Darwin had to drop his old contrast between monstrous, selected, domestic races and adaptive, not selected, wild species.",11
148,"He dropped it first, it seems, on considering sporting-dog breeds, notably greyhounds; for these, although formed by the human artifice of selective breeding, had been given both structures and instincts useful in the wild.",11
149,(Hence the carnivorous canines In Darwin's later thought-experiments on natural selection.),11
150,"now, domestic race formation had provided Darwin only with analogies for the formation of wild species as ancient, true breeding and intersterile races.",11
151,"With this new selective breeding analogy, domestic races, as adaptations, are also providing analogies for the formation of wild species as ancient and perfectly adapted races.",11
152,"The third stage came seemingly early in 1839, when this new analogy prompted a further revision to the opening steps of the overall argumentation.",11
153,"In artificial selection, the chosen end, for which the race is being fitted, does not elicit the variation being selected.",11
154,"So, Darwin reasoned, natural selection likewise could work with variation that is accidentally  necessarily adaptive.",11
155,"If changes in conditions disrupt the precise replication of parental characters to yield hereditary variation, then, providing only that some of it happens to be adaptive, this will suffice in the long run for selection as a cause of adaptive species formations.",11
156,"With these developments beyond his mid-September 1838 positions, Darwin had reached the theory of natural selection much as he would publish it later.",11
157,"In March 1839, he even outlined the argumentative structure that opens his of 1842 (F. Darwin, 1909), the first, manuscript, version of (1859).",11
158,"By 1841, he had very probably worked out, also, his later theory of individual organism generation: pangenesis.",11
159,"The theory, as eventually set forth (1868), was constituted by two theses: that the generative material comes from all over the parent body or bodies, and that it consists of minute ‘gemmules’ budded off from every part.",11
160,"Darwin's preoccupation with generation went back to Edinburgh and to consequent inquiry, when on the voyage, into modes of reproduction common to various invertebrate groups (Sloan, personal communication).",11
161,"In early 1837, he had supported the senescence analogy between sexual and asexual generation by interpreting all generation as division, whether artificial or natural, complete or incomplete, simultaneous or successive.",11
162,"This thesis, that all generation is division, continued throughout the B, C and D notebooks and was reinforced by an explicit equating, in September 1838, of division and gemmation or budding.",11
163,"The equation made all generation, sexual or otherwise, a form of budding.",11
164,"However, in his theorizing about sexual generation, as being unique in allowing variation and adaptation, Darwin made a fundamental distinction between sexual buds, ova, and asexual buds.",11
165,"this distinction, all and only sexual buds are involved in maturation and fertilization.",11
166,"Consequently all and only sexual buds are impressionable, whether by the action of changed conditions or by a sexual element from a mate of unlike constitution.",11
167,"Conversely, while lacking those powers an asexual bud, or even a severed flatworm fragment, can do what an unfertilized ovum can not: namely, produce a whole organism without interactive collaboration with any other part; this power being credited by Darwin to the presence in such a bud or fragment, indeed in any healing flesh, of material determining growth for all the parts of the whole organism.",11
168,"Switching now from 1838 to 1868, one sees, in direct contrast with this earlier view, that a principal object of pangenesis is to explain how in all generation, sexual and asexual, the powers are the same and so, too, the material.",11
169,"To this end, Darwin adduces, most especially, those phenomena  that would be anomalous for any exclusive correlation of maturation, fertilization and impressionability with sexual asexual modes of generation.",11
170,"Thus aphid parthenogenesis shows an unfertilized ovum producing a maturing organism with no prior interaction with a male element; again, so-called graft hybrids and the effects of pollen on non-germinal tissue in a female plant both show impressionability without fertilization and maturation; while sporting and reversion in asexual plant buds show variation without fertilization or maturation.",11
171,"So, as contrasted with his September 1838 position, Darwin sees pangenesis as an evening up, on both sides, of all the powers of the sexual and asexual parts of any organism.",11
172,Pangenesis is itself presented as a theory of how this identity of powers arises in development.,11
173,"In a developing organism, starting as a fertilized egg, each cell or tissue, throughout its own maturation, is budding off miniature facsimiles of itself, the ‘gemmules’.",11
174,"The whole organism can then have, as an adult, the same powers in its asexual buds and its sexual organs, because the same material is there: namely, ‘gemmules’ collected from all over the body.",11
175,"These gemmules have, accordingly, been invested by Darwin with two sorts of properties: those credited to every asexual part of the body, in 1838, to explain its generative and regenerative powers, and those invoked then to explain the impressionability and variability of immature ova.",11
176,"So, pangenesis could have been derived from the 1838 position, by pandynamic extension to the ova of powers previously denied to them, and by a panovulational extension to all other parts of powers and matters formerly reserved for the ovary.",11
177,"But is that, in fact, how Darwin arrived at pangenesis?",11
178,No known document confirms that it was.,11
179,"But all the indirect evidence, including the records of his reading in such writers on generation as Erasmus Darwin, Johannes Müller and Giorgio Gallesio, makes it most probable that he came to pangenesis in such a revision of his 1838 position, and that he did so in the years 1840–1.",11
180,"However and whenever it was first formulated, this pangenetic reduction of every mode of generation to micro-ovulo-gemmation could take inheritance, it was completely conservative, to be effected by an exact replication of a whole in all its parts; variation, reversion are explicable as disturbances, suspensions and complications of that fundamental replicative tendency.",11
181,"Thus could pangenesis unify all Darwin's generation theorizing from gemmules to organisms and species, and beyond them the whole tree of life.",11
182,"Pangenesis was never, however, to meet the evidential ideal, as Darwin himself was keenly aware, and he published it only after natural selection had been launched unencumbered by any such conjectural causation for generation.",11
183,"The argument of the 1842 (and so, too, of the ) was knowingly structured to accord with that ideal (Hodge, 1977).",11
184,"The existence of natural selection as a causal agency is evidenced first; then its adequacy to produce new species from old is argued by analogy from the ability of artificial selection, although much less precise and prolonged, to produce domestic races.",11
185,"Finally, Darwin displays the indirect evidence for the theory: the explanations it provides for a wide array of facts in biogeography, geology, embryology .",11
186,"With the 1842 written, Darwin's most creative period was ended.",11
187,"That year he moved London to the Kent countryside and was henceforth mainly writing books, raising children and nursing his health.",11
188,He never had another fundamentally novel idea in general biological theory.,11
189,But then he had already had enough to keep him and many others occupied for a very long time.,11
190,The nature of Darwin's science,11
191,Even this brief analysis of Darwin's biological theorizing in these early years suggests the following conclusions about the nature of his science in its formative phase.,11
192,.,11
193,The traditional way to connect Darwin's science with his society is through Malthus's political economy.,11
194,But this cannot be adequate.,11
195,"A capitalism connection is relevant in the 1840s and 1850s when Darwin is applying division of labour theory to the problems of divergence (Schweber, 1980; Ospovat, 1981).",11
196,"But in 1838 it was Malthus's theodicy of ancient empires, not his political economy of the modern state that bore decisively on Darwin's biogeography and ecology (Bowler, 1976).",11
197,"More generally, any connection helps very little in understanding how Darwin came to take up the problems his theorizing was to solve.",11
198,"Here it is his family, especially his grandfather, and his mentor Lyell, that indicate connections with movements of thought directly linked with fundamental social change.",11
199,"Erasmus Darwin, a Birmingham Lunar Society man, belonged to a provincial movement of ‘radical’ dissent from national and metropolitan orthodoxies in politics and religion.",11
200,"Lyell was a ‘liberal’ Scots Whig very much in the tradition of John Playfair and his own father-in-law Leonard Horner, a tradition bent on using  electoral and educational, including university, reforms to break the national and metropolitan hegemony of the Tory, Oxonian, Anglican establishment.",11
201,"It is in such mediating contexts, in any direct tie to capital through , that the social history of Darwin's science should be sought.",11
202,"It is in such mediating contexts, in any direct tie to capital through , that the social history of Darwin's science should be sought.",11
203,"To Darwin, natural selection, as a causal agency and lawful process, was akin, in its credentials, to gravitational force in celestial mechanics.",11
204,"But his earliest critics often judged his theorizing not to match the standards set by Newtonian physics (Hull, 1973).",11
205,"Was Darwin, then, mistaken in so relating his own science to Newton's?",11
206,"He was, he underestimated the implications of one major disanalogy: he had no law that was to natural selection as the Newtonian inverse square law (with proportionality to mass products) was to gravitational attraction.",11
207,"For this disanalogy arose from another: Darwin's natural selection as a lawn process was complex, being compounded from heredity, variation and superfecundity, each of those processes having its own laws; while Newton's gravitational force was not compound and had a single law of its own.",11
208,"Now, from these disanalogies arose a further one.",11
209,"In simple cases, the consequences in certain conditions of Newtonian gravitational attraction could be deduced and the adequacy of this cause for certain phenomena, most notably elliptical planetary orbits, thereby established.",11
210,"By contrast, the consequences and so competences, and hence the adequacies or inadequacies, of natural selection, especially for long-run effects, were practically impossible to decide, for a finite intellect; although the young Darwin himself could consistently suppose that God in choosing this means for adapting life to a changing earth had foreseen all its consequences.",11
211,"However, although these disanalogies were fundamental, Darwin's theorizing had not taken him the causal, lawful, deterministic Newtonian universe, into one as irreducibly acausal and absolutely probabilistic as is sometimes thought implicit in quantum mechanics.",11
212,Any natural selection involves differential reproductive success that is nonfortuitous because determined by the way variant organisms are interacting with an environment that is causally sensitive to those particular physical differences in the organisms.,11
213,"If more red than green members of a species of moth living on green foliage are being killed by predators, that may be selection; but only if the predators are not  colour-blind; if they are it is random sampling error.",11
214,But killed by colour-blind predators the moths are not victims of any capricious cosmic indeterminacy; for each of their deaths is a causally determined event.,11
215,"It is only as deaths of red or green moths in that environment that these are fortuitous events; this fortuitousness being, as philosophers say, description relative.",11
216,"Again, as Darwin saw it, the chanciness of hereditary variation is relative, not absolute.",11
217,"The processes generating this variation he supposed to be lawful, causal and so determinate; but not causally sensitive to environmental conditions in such a way that any particular change in conditions elicits an increased supply of those variants that are adaptive in the new conditions.",11
218,"So, the distinctions decisive for Darwin's account of the generation and the fate of variation are distinctions drawn within the presuppositions of a deterministic universe.",11
219,"In its dependence on those presuppositions his biology was more like statistical than either celestial or quantum mechanics (Hull, 1974).",11
220,.,11
221,"Darwin's argumentation shows that natural selection is not tautologous for one reason, ultimately.",11
222,"The definitional question, of what natural selection is, can be answered by specifying necessary and sufficient conditions for its occurrence, namely hereditary variation that is causally relevant to reproductive success thanks to organism-environment interactions; it can, then, be answered without begging in advance of empirical inquiry all those further questions whether these conditions are ever met: whether, , any natural selection exists; and, if so, how it is distributed, what it can do now and what it has been responsible for in the past.",11
223,"It is, then, a mistake to defend natural selection against the tautology objection by proposing criteria of fitness independent of reproductive success.",11
224,Fitness differences are best understood as reproductive expectancy differences analogous to normalized life expectancy differences.,11
225,And as such they have no causal or explanatory power of their own.,11
226,"If Jones has outlived Smith this cannot be explained by showing that he earlier had the higher life expectancy, and then arguing that this duly caused him to live the longer life.",11
227,It can be explained by citing earlier physical differences; perhaps Jones jogged while Smith smoked.,11
228,"Likewise, in natural selection it is physical differences, not the differences in reproductive expectancies estimated from them, that can cause and can explain subsequent reproductive performance differences.",11
229,"As differing expectancies, fitnesses can neither cause reproductive  performance differences nor be definitionally equated with them.",11
230,"So, natural selection is no untestable tautology, but not because fitness measurements, as expectancy estimates, can sometimes be falsified by later performance measurements.",11
231,"Natural selection is no tautology, because there is no proof, from its definition alone, for its existence, nor then for its prevalence, or its adequacy or its responsibility for evolution.",11
232,"If there were, then the last decade and a half of selectionist-neutralist controversies over all these different non-definitional issues could have been settled in advance without recourse to empirical data, in an armchair with a scientist's glossary and a logician's truth table.",11
233,"As Michael Ruse observes (1981) if selectionism is a tautology, neutralism is a contradiction, Darwin's strategy in structuring his argumentation to conform to the ideal shows why it is not.",11
234,.,11
235,"Early in 1900, the doyen of Columbia University biology, E. B. Wilson, introduced the new second edition of his treatise,, by arguing that the main challenge then facing biological science was to integrate its two greatest achievements in the past century: the theory of evolution and the theory of cells.",11
236,And he explained why he saw August Weismann's theory of the continuity of the germ plasm as the most promising foundation for any such integration.,11
237,Wilson's position makes sense of a great deal in the history of general biological theory before and since 1900.,11
238,"It has often been said that the decisive development since Darwin was a new synthesis, in the 1920s and 1930s, of Mendel on heredity and Darwin on selection.",11
239,"Wilson brings out the importance of that earlier and no less fundamental post-Darwinian synthesis, which this later one presupposed: the synthesis of evolution and cytology.",11
240,"Since Wilson's teachings were a principal inspiration for the Morgan school, the twentieth century science of genetics may be said to have arisen within his Weismannist programme for the integration of evolutionary and cytological theorizing (Mayr, 1982).",11
241,"Darwin's integration of evolutionary and physiological biology had been attempted, in the 1840s, through pangenesis.",11
242,But pangenesis was not reconcilable with the cytological consensus just emerging when Darwin published it a quarter of a century later.,11
243,"Physiologists were then increasingly agreeing that every cellular organism is either a single cell or a cell colony arising from the successive divisions of a single cell, and that two cells come together to form one at fertilization, each having arisen by the division of one cell in the respective parent body.",11
244,"In Darwin's version pangenesis could not be squared with these  cytological generalizations; for, if each of the two masses of gemmules coming together at fertilization is taken to be one cell, then it has not arisen in the division of one cell in that parent; while, if each is taken to be a myriad of cells, then far too many are coming together at fertilization.",11
245,"The problem of transforming Darwin's pangenetic theory to square it with cytology , and with Weismann's theory , was taken up most systematically by De Vries; and later developments leading to the theory of the gene were to owe much to his solution: ‘intracellular pangenesis’.",11
246,"So, Darwin's attempt to integrate evolutionary and physiological biology contributed indirectly to the unification that was called for in Wilson's 1900 programme and that genetics was to secure.",11
247,That Darwin's ideas could have such manifold influence throughout the entire structure of modern biological theory should not now be surprising.,11
248,"Compulsive, selfconscious intellectual, ‘philosopher’ no less than ‘naturalist’, he had worked from his earliest years on a very broad canvas indeed.",11
249,A DARWINIAN PLANT ECOLOGY John L. HARPER,11
250,"‘…on a piece of ground 3 feet long and 2 feet wide, dug and cleared, and where there could be no choking from other plants, I marked all the seedlings of our native weeds as they came up, and 357 no 295 were destroyed, chiefly by slugs and insects.",11
251,"If turf which has long been mown, and the case would be the same with turf closely browsed by quadrupeds, be let to grow, the more vigorous plants gradually kill the less vigorous, though fully grown plants; thus 20 species growing on a little plot of mown turf (3 feet by 4 feet) 9 species perished, from the other species being allowed to grow up freely’().",11
252,It is difficult to detect any direct influence of Darwin's writings on the development of the main stream of plant ecology.,11
253,"The extreme reductionist approach that is represented in the above quotation, and is apparent again and again in his writings, not only in but in many of his later books, is conspicuous by its absence from early plant ecological texts and is barely represented in the ecological literature until towards the middle of the twentieth century.",11
254,"The approach that involved marking individual plants or seedlings in the field, tracing the fate of individual leaves as they are pulled down earthworm burrows, the behaviour of tendrils as they touch a support, the fate of insects as they land on a leaf, or recording the number of seeds at the bottom of an earthworm burrow, represented a reductionist level of concentrated observation that contrasted with the geographical view of vegetation with which Warming and others set the early direction of plant ecology.",11
255,There is no way in which Darwin can be regarded as a parent of the science of plant ecology.,11
256,Nothing illustrates this point so clearly as the fate of a paper published in 1874 by C. Nägeli entitled .,11
257,This paper was directly stimulated by and in it Nägeli  developed mathematical models that describe the interaction between populations of two species of plants.,11
258,"His models attempt to describe in formal mathematical terms the replacement of a population of one species by another and also situations in which pairs of species persist together as stable, mixed populations.",11
259,Nägeli's models included density-dependent and frequency-dependent situations and came very close to providing a formal description of the niche.,11
260,"It might have been expected that such a paper from Nägeli, who was one of the most distinguished botanists in Europe at that time, would have had immense impact on the early development of plant ecology.",11
261,"Instead, it appears to have been wholly ignored for 60 years until it was mentioned briefly by Gauze (1934) in his book .",11
262,Plant ecology developed not as a study of the factors affecting the lives and deaths of individual plants and their parts but as a study of the distribution of vegetation types and of particular species.,11
263,It included also the description of those specialized features of morphology and physiology that distinguish species and might (often by more or less inspired guesswork) be said to account for the differences in their distribution.,11
264,That these features were often called ‘adaptations’ did nothing to explain them.,11
265,"Much of the early science of plant ecology sought for correlations between vegetation and physical, not biotic, factors in the environment, most particularly temperature, water supply and soil types.",11
266,"These forces have been described as ‘Wallacian’(Harper, 1977), because they represent those agents of natural selection that were of more concern to Wallace than to Darwin in accounting for how organisms are as they are and behave as they do.",11
267,The role of biotic (Darwinian) forces in determining the distribution and abundance of species was largely neglected except by token reference to grazing animals.,11
268,"The essentially Darwinian forces of struggle for existence, involving competitive interactions between members of the same species and between different species, played a negligible part in the interpretation of natural vegetation.",11
269,"The Darwinian approach, involving reductionist concentration on individual plants and the hazards that they experience, particularly the interference from their neighbours, entered the science of plant ecology in the late nineteen twenties in simple experiments involving mixed populations of two or more species and I have described elsewhere (Harper, 1967) the curious piece of history in which three leading ecologists, Sukatschev in Russia, Clements in the United States and Tansley in Britain, all made simple competition experiments involving deliberately-sown plant populations.",11
270,None of these authors continued with this type of study and  all returned to essentially descriptive studies of vegetation.,11
271,It was they had found it too difficult to bridge the gap between simple experimental systems and the complexity of nature — the reductionism of the experimental method lost the holist qualities of the integrated complex whole that these distinguished ecologists saw in natural vegetation.,11
272,"Both Clements' and Tansley's can be represented as a retreat to community holism after a brief flirtation with an organismal, Darwinian ecology.",11
273,"A piece of ecological history that remains to be fully researched was the decision by a number of individuals, many apparently working in isolation from , to establish, like Darwin, permanent plots within which the fate of individual plants could be recorded over time.",11
274,"The great classic amongst such observations is the work of Carl Olaf Tamm (1948, 19721 who marked out permanent quadrats in woodland and grassland near his country home and as a hobby mapped, remapped and continues to map the plants within them.",11
275,"Tamm attributes his decision to embark on this long-term programme to stimulus from Romell, a distinguished Swedish ecologist and soil scientist.",11
276,"Other permanent quadrats were set up by Forrest Shreve (1915) at the Desert Laboratory of the Carnegie Institute of Washington at Tucson, Arizona, and it appears to be through a colleague of Shreve, W. A. Cannon, that T. G. B. Osborn was stimulated in 1926 to set up permanent quadrats in heavily used shrub land and a reserve released from grazing at Koonamore in S. Australia (Osborn, Wood & Partridge, 1935; O. B. Williams & Mott, 1981).",11
277,"There is also a European tradition that precedes the work of Tamm, associated with the name of Bogdanovskaya-Gienef (1926) who seems to have been a pupil of Sukatschev and to have influenced the reductionist approach to ecology later developed by Rabotnov, Uranov and their pupils in Russia.",11
278,She reported her two-year study of four 20 × 20 cm quadrats.,11
279,"Her publications list appears to consist of only two papers, but she may have had a greater influence than this suggests (J. White, personal communication).",11
280,"The peculiar quality of Tamm's work was that he recorded individual plants, shoots or rosettes, within his populations and this enabled him to follow the fates of individual plant units (often tillers or ramets) to study the grosser vegetational change that was the aim of many others who set up permanent quadrats.",11
281,"The data obtained from Tamm's studies revealed, for the first time, the magnitude of the flux that underlay, the apparent stability of many plant communities and (after Darwin) gave the first real insight into plant community dynamics dominated by establishment and deaths.",11
282,Vegetation is composed of the few plants that survive  and grow: to explain that vegetation it may be more important to study the many that die.,11
283,"In many of Tamm's populations it can be shown (Harper, 1967) that the plants originally present were progressively lost and that the rate of loss was remarkably constant.",11
284,Half-lives could be calculated for the populations — differing from species to species but constant over the years.,11
285,"Such data made it clear that (i) it was realistic and profitable to study individual species, even within a complex community and (ii) that the dynamics of the populations appeared to be largely independent of year-to-year fluctuations in climate.",11
286,"Later studies of permanent quadrats in grassland by Sagar, Sarukhän, Hawthorn and others (see Harper, 1977) extended over fewer years but involved repeated observations within each year.",11
287,They showed that the death risks to plants in populations within years were commonly greatest when the survivors were growing fastest — not during the periods when the anthropomorphically-minded botanist would regard the physical environment as ‘harsh’.,11
288,The likely explanation is that it is biotic pressure from competing neighbours ‘harshness’ of the physical environment that is the prime cause of death of most plants and perhaps of natural selection.,11
289,"Most of these detailed demographic studies have been made with pasture or woodland systems in northern temperate regions and it could well be that in arid zones, and some other extreme environments, biotic pressures are less dominant and then climatic factors may play the major role in killing plants and in natural selection.",11
290,"At a Symposium organized to pay tribute to Darwin a hundred years after his death, it is perhaps permitted to expand on one tiny fragment of ecological research that may truly be said to have been directly stimulated by Darwin's own writings, by the paragraph quoted as heading to this paper.",11
291,"Early in the 1960s the decision was made to concentrate a number of intensive ecological studies based at Bangor, North Wales, on a single, small (1 ha) field of permanent grassland, part of the College Farm at Henfaes, Aber, near Bangor.",11
292,The field was chosen because it was superficially very dull — lacking any obvious heterogeneity of contour and relatively homogeneous in soil properties.,11
293,The field had not been ploughed for 80 years (probably not for 150 years) and there is no record of fertilizer or herbicide ever having been applied.,11
294,A general description of the field is given in Turkington & Harper (1979a) and more detailed analysis of the soil and flora in Turkington (1975).,11
295,Many graduate students and overseas visitors have worked on aspects of the ecology of this field.,11
296,"In many cases the studies have concentrated  on populations of a single species within 1 m&sup2; quadrats, though sometimes the reductionist level of study has been yet smaller — a scale of 1 cm&sup2;(Thorhallsdottir, 1983).",11
297,"The concentration of effort within one small field, and on small quadrats within it, gives the studies high precision and high relevance but with an absolute sacrifice of generality.",11
298,"We do not know whether most of what we have observed in this field can be generalized to other fields or, indeed, to less intensively studied parts of the same field.",11
299,"The vegetation of the field was analysed by ordination and correlation techniques which showed that only a minor part of the variation in species distribution could be accounted for by underlying edaphic factors, though in the peripheral areas of the pasture the presence of hedges and trees accounted for significant changes in the vegetation — e.g. occurred mainly in or close to the shade of the trees.",11
300,"Two common species,and were usually positively associated in their microdistribution and negatively associated with other species.",11
301,"The structure of the vegetation was interpreted as determined by regeneration cycles directed by and — the species themselves appeared to be the prime determinants of each others distribution (Turkington and Harper, 1979a, b).",11
302,The most intensive studies on the field have been made on populations of three species of and on .,11
303,Some of the work is still in midstream and consequently some material referred to in this paper represents an interim report.,11
304,"Two of the species present in the field are of particular interest, both to population biologists interested in the manner in which the numbers of plants are regulated and to evolutionists concerned with the extent and significance of natural variation.",11
305,The two species are and .,11
306,Both possess the property of clonal growth by which the product of a single zygote forms a spreading clone of rooted nodes capable of vegetative extension through the sward.,11
307,Such plants have the potential for a single clone or genet (product of a single zygote) to dominate large areas of the vegetation.,11
308,"Indeed, it would be theoretically possible for one genet of or to have occupied the whole of the Henfaes field.",11
309,In other plants with such clonal growth it is known that the product of a single zygote may indeed occupy considerable areas of land.,11
310,"An extreme example is bracken,; Oinonen (1967) showed that individual clones in Finland were 1440 years old and one old clone extended over an area of 474 × 292 m.",11
311,"There are other cases in which clone-forming species are known to produce large areas of genetic monotony, e.g. (Harberd, 1961) and (Harberd 1967).",11
312,"It might be expected that where such clonal growth is possible, the struggle for existence over long periods of stable management would lead to the local dominance of single clones — those that had succeeded in a struggle for existence with others.",11
313,The population dynamics and genetics of these two species in the permanent pasture at Henfaes seemed to over the opportunity to study natural selection in action — Hutchinson's ‘ecological theater and evolutionary play’.,11
314,Population dynamics of Ranunculus repens,11
315,The detailed demographic studies of made by Sarukhán in the field at Henfaes and followed by unpublished studies by Soane made it possible to give quantitative measures to the population dynamics of this species.,11
316,These are summarized in the life-cycle diagram of Fig. 16.1.,11
317,"Populations of this species showed vigorous vegetative growth, and most new rosettes recruited to the population appeared as ramets (clonal replicates) from existing rosettes.",11
318,The input of new seedlings was small and the number eventually contributing to mature rosettes in the pasture seemed insignificant the contribution from clonal growth.,11
319,"the other two species of and present in the pasture, seed production and the numbers of seedlings observed was very small.",11
320,Plants of produced  on average one seed per rosette (cf. .,11
321,15 for ).,11
322,"In the studied quadrats, 25 seedlings of emerged per metre square from the long-lived bank of seeds in the soil, in contrast with 176 of and 95 of .",11
323,The dynamics of populations was followed over four years during which new seedlings that died and those that survived to form rosettes were recorded.,11
324,The development of clones from the rosettes present at the beginning of the study was also recorded in detail the clonal parent was known for almost every rosette present in the quadrats at the end of the study.,11
325,"These data allowed Soane & Watkinson (1979) to build a computer simulation model to examine the relationship between the flux of ramets, the recruitment of seedlings and the diversity of genets within   the populations.",11
326,The computer models simulated the actual flux of ramets in each of eight studied populations and followed the fates of ramets and families of ramets between families.,11
327,The real and simulated changes in the populations are shown in Fig. 16.2.,11
328,Agreement is extremely close and provides little evidence for selection between families or against new seedling recruits.,11
329,"In the simulation model, in the absence of selection, the number of original families present in the population declined at an approximately exponential rate.",11
330,"With the passage of time the contribution that these families made to the total genetic diversity of the population became subordinate to the seedling recruits: although the number of seedlings appears to be very small, their contribution to the total number of genetic individuals in the population is clearly significant in determining the number of clones or genets that are present.",11
331,"In the absence of selection, the observed small numbers of seedling recruits would apparently be sufficient to maintain potentially high genet diversity within such a vigorously clonal plant population.",11
332,"Such genetic diversity was indeed present, because there was visible genetic polymorphism within the populations and it was shown (M. J. Lawrence, personal communication) that there was considerable genetic variability both in quantitative characters and in polymorphism at two enzyme loci in populations immediately the permanent quadrats.",11
333,Population dynamics and genetic variation in Trifolium repens,11
334,Analysis of the population dynamics and associated genetics of in the same pasture is even more revealing.,11
335,is unusual in that much of the genetic variation present within the populations is easily recognised in phenotypic differences that are visible or easily determined on plants in the field.,11
336,Leaf mark polymorphism is one such property.,11
337,A variety of white leaf marks is found in natural populations and these are represented by multiple alleles at a single locus.,11
338,"In mid-summer, when the marks are most fully expressed, the genotypes of most plants can be identified in the field and an estimate of the number of clones present within an area can be made: it will, , be a minimal estimate.",11
339,"Cahn & Harper (1976a) determined the number of clones present within 10 × 10 cm quadrats and found, to considerable surprise, that between 3 and 4 clones per quadrat was the most common situation in the field.",11
340,"This level of genetic diversity at a fine scale was confirmed in other permanent grasslands in Britain including Port Meadow, Oxford, which is  896 years old!",11
341,"Clearly, single clones did not dominate patches even at this very fine scale.",11
342,"More recently, Trathan has identified genetic individuals with more precision using isoenzyme analysis.",11
343,He finds 48–50 distinct genotypes present per metre square.,11
344,The various clones weave amongst and intermingle with and amongst grasses and associated herbs.,11
345,The degree of intermingling may itself reflect the growth form of stoloniferous species.,11
346,Both and have ‘ ’ growth forms in contrast to the predominantly ‘phalanx’forms of the associated grass species.,11
347,"By ‘ ’ growth form is implied one that is continually wandering amidst associated vegetation, creeping into new and escaping from old patches in the community.",11
348,"In contrast, ‘phalanx’ growth forms develop a structure of tightly packed shoots (most of the pasture grasses and some pasture dicots )(Lovett Doust, 1981).",11
349,Not only has a  growth form but its  character is exaggerated when it is growing with grasses; its branching then tends to be reduced and growth is concentrated in linear extension.,11
350,"a genet locally consolidating its occupancy of a site, individual stolons wander as linear extensions of the genet into surrounding vegetation.",11
351,This growth form itself maximises the chance that genets will intermingle: it maximizes the role of interspecific contacts in the life of the genet.,11
352,Darwin commented on the growth of such plants and the ways in which they penetrate amongst other vegetation.,11
353,"He describes his own (very Darwinian!) experiment in which he allowed the stolons of (a classic ‘ ’ growth form) to encounter an artificial vegetation that he had constructed: ‘Many long pins were next driven rather close together into the sand, to form a crowd …two thin lateral branches; but these easily wound their way through the crowd.",11
354,"A thick stolon was much delayed in its passage; at one place it was forced to turn at right angles to its former course; at another place it could not pass through the pins, and the hinder part became bowed; it then curved upwards and passed through an opening between the upper part of some pins which happen to diverge; it then descended and finally emerged through the crowd’(Darwin, 1880).",11
355,Another approach to the study of variation within populations of white clover in the Henfaes field was made by Burdon (1980).,11
356,He sampled 50 white clover clones from a grid covering the whole field.,11
357,He multiplied the clones in the glasshouse and screened them for a variety of characters (Fig. 16.3).,11
358,These included a number with simple Mendelian inheritance and a number of characters of agronomic importance with polygenically  controlled expression.,11
359,He was able to use these characters to produce identity diagrams that distinguished and ‘finger-printed’ each clone.,11
360,The 50 clones differed on average from in 3. 3 vegetative characters.,11
361,If floral characters were included in the comparison the average difference between clones was 5.4 characters.,11
362,(One pair of clones differed in 13 statistically significant and apparently independent respects!),11
363,Many of the characters considered had been shown by other workers to be of selective importance in white clover or another species of (e.g. Cahn & Harper (1976b) had presented evidence suggesting that sheep selected between leaf marks; Dirzo & Harper (1982a) and others have shown that slugs select between cyanogenic and acyanogenic forms; Black (1960) had shown the selective value of long petioles).,11
364,The polymorphisms in the Henfaes population were not exhausted in Burdon's study.,11
365,"It has now been shown that variation in relative growth rates can be added to the list (Burdon & Harper, 1980).",11
366,Natural populations of white clover are polymorphic for incompatibility alleles and for the ability to form nitrogen fixing symbioses with strains of but these have not been looked at at Henfaes.,11
367,Berrington (personal communication) has recently shown that clones within the field differ in their ability to form endotrophic mycorrhizal associations.,11
368,The polymorphism that is found within white clover populations in the field represents therefore a subtle (or? random) variety of unique associations of apparently selectively important properties.,11
369,The imagination of the most extreme selectionist is stretched to breaking point by such a situation.,11
370,Evidence for local specialization within white clover,11
371,Plants that are capable of clonal growth offer peculiar opportunities for testing the extent to which particular genets are locally specialized.,11
372,"A plant may be sampled from the field, multiplied clonally and the clonal products (genetic identities) can then be reinserted into the field, both in the places from which the clones originally came and into other places.",11
373,Plants of the same genotype can then be tested in different environments.,11
374,"Turkington made such an experiment with white clover in the field at Henfaes (Turkington & Harper, 1979b).",11
375,"Clones of white clover were sampled from within patches in the field dominated by each of four common grasses,and .",11
376,The clones were multiplied in the glasshouse and then transplanted back into patches of the field dominated by the four grass species.,11
377,The performance of the transplants was measured by vegetative growth expressed as dry weight at harvest after twelve months.,11
378,The results are shown in Fig. 16.4.,11
379,Over the whole experiment clones of clover that were returned to their original grass associate made more growth than those introduced to alien sites (significant at P < 0.001).,11
380,The clover clones had also been introduced into sites from which the existing vegetation had been denuded by treatment   with the paraquat herbicide.,11
381,"Some of the ‘principal diagonal effect’ remained, though the difference in yield between clones returned to their site and those returned to alien sites was now significant only at P < 0.05.",11
382,Turkington made a further experiment in which he introduced the four clone types of white clover into pure swards of the four grass species that had been sown on soil sampled from the experimental field.,11
383,This part of the experiment was designed to remove possible place-to-place variations in soil conditions in the studied field from the comparison.,11
384,"The yield of clones grown with the grass species from which they had originally been sampled again exceeded that made when they were grown in an ‘alien’ sward, P < 0.00001.",11
385,It is difficult to interpret the results of this experiment as representing anything but evidence of precise specialization of clover clones in their ability to grow particular grass neighbours.,11
386,"It suggests that, within the pasture, strains of white clover have been selected by competitive interaction with associated grasses and that different species of grass contribute to the diversifying or disruptive selection operating upon the population of white clover.",11
387,"Some, , of the variation within the white clover populations thus appears to be directly interpretable attributes contributing to present fitness.",11
388,It is a very Darwinian interpretation to suggest that the grass neighbours may be primary forces selecting and diversifying the clover populations.,11
389,Hill (1976) grew a clone of white clover with a variety of clones of .,11
390,Quite distinct phenotypic modifications were elicited from the clone by the different ryegrass strains.,11
391,"If different strains of produce different phenotypes from the same clone of white clover, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that different species of grass are even more likely to exert different selective pressures within populations of white clover.",11
392,It is not easy to measure and describe just how the different clones of white clover differ in their reaction to different neighbouring grass species or forms.,11
393,Survivorship and dry matter production are very gross measures of a plant's reaction to different types of neighbour.,11
394,"We have, , no real indication of the manner in which ecological compatibility (ecological combining ability) between particular strains of white clover and particular pasture grasses is accomplished.",11
395,"It may represent subtle differences in growth cycle or growth form or more complex interactions involving the soil microflora, perhaps the mycorrhizae.",11
396,There may be subtleties of interaction below the soil surface of which we know little or nothing.,11
397,"The hazards in the life of a plant in the field are not only those  of competition from neighbours, though it may be these that are the most relentless.",11
398,Hazards in the life of a plant in the field,11
399,Some of the hazards to the life of a plant in the field can be measured by studying the fate of individual leaves or flowers or seeds.,11
400,An attempt to catalogue and quantify these hazards in the field at Henfaes was made by Peters (1980) who included white clover amongst the species that he studied.,11
401,He marked young leaves as they began to expand and then followed their fate by repeated observation.,11
402,From this he could obtain survivorship curves for cohorts of leaves born in the same time period and record some of the causes of death or damage within the populations (Fig. 16.5).,11
403,Some leaf predators leave tell-tale records of their activity.,11
404,", grazing molluscs leave characteristic erosions from a leaf edge; birds, particularly the wood-pigeon, feed on clover and often leave characteristic beak-marks; weevils remove circles of tissue, often leaving   the upper epidermis intact; sheep (causing damage probably indistinguishable from that caused by rabbits) remove whole leaves, leaving torn petioles or leave their bite marks on the leaflets that remain.",11
405,Tracking the fate of individual leaves immediately reveals a number of other hazards.,11
406,"Leaves may be submerged under a dropping of dung, soused in a downpour of urine, trodden on, pulled into the ground by earthworms (further shades of Darwin) or damaged by frost.",11
407,"The frequency of these various events in, or ending, the life of a leaf are shown in Table 16.1.",11
408,"Grazing animals are, however, the major hazards for a leaf though all leaves in a pasture are not equally at risk.",11
409,"Weevils bite holes in the leaves of white clover and of species but the relative severity of attacks on and change through the season,being more attacked in early, and in late, summer.",11
410,Fig. 16.6 shows the relative proportion of the leaf population that suffered damage from leaf grazers in populations of and .,11
411,"Surprisingly, the leaves of white clover suffered proportionately much less from grazing by sheep than did those of , but leaves of suffered much more from both slugs and weevils (except towards the end of the growing season).",11
412,"Grazing by molluscs figured so strongly among the hazards to a clover   leaf that it seems reasonable to expect that, in those years when slugs or snails were abundant, they may act as important selective forces within clover populations.",11
413,White clover is polymorphic for the presence or absence of cyanogenic glucosinolates and is also polymorphic for the beta glucosidases that release HCN from glucosinolates when a leaf is damaged.,11
414,There is considerable variation in the extent to which cyanogenic properties are expressed and there is some seasonal and perhaps other causes of variation in expression.,11
415,"Nevertheless, it is possible to classify plants in the field by taking leaf samples and performing appropriate tests (see Dirzo & Harper, 1982a) and to categorize the plants into four groups Ac Li, Ac li, ac Li, ac li.",11
416,After a period of exposure to grazing one can then test for the   frequency of the various types of damage to clover leaves with the different genotypes and afterwards reconfirm the cyanogenic or acyanogenic status of the plant (Fig. 16.7).,11
417,There have been many studies of selection by molluscs on cyanogenic and acyanogenic morphs of white clover under laboratory or other controlled conditions.,11
418,It seemed that it might be possible to relate the variation in the polymorphism to slug density in the Henfaes field.,11
419,The density of slugs was determined at sites arranged on a grid across the field at Henfaes.,11
420,Dirzo (1982b) used trend-surface analysis to draw contours of mollusc density (see Fig. 16.8) and added some further information from visual inspection of the field.,11
421,"Most notably, he added one big and two small islands (shown in Fig. 16.8 as having high and very high slug densities) which were patches of nettle,.",11
422,"Slugs tend to concentrate in such refuges, presumably because they give protection from desiccation.",11
423,He then determined the cyanogenesis category of the clover plant each grid intersection.,11
424,Table 16.2 shows the distribution of the different glucosinolate morphs of between areas with different densities of active molluscs.,11
425,There is a clear excess over expectation of cyanogenic forms in the areas of high and very high mollusc density and of acyanogenic forms in the areas of very low mollusc density.,11
426,It appears that some of the variation in the cyanogenesis polymorphism over the field can be explained as local micro-evolution locally patchy selection.,11
427,"Two strands of evidence, that from the reciprocal transplanting of clover into the neighbourhood of different grasses and that from the study of the distribution of cyanogenic properties and the distribution of slugs, allow an easy interpretation immediate and selective forces.",11
428,How far this interpretation can be extended to the whole gamut of characters for which Burdon had shown the populations to be polymorphic must be very doubtful.,11
429,"Certainly almost all of the characters that Burdon lists have been shown to be of selective importance either in clover or in some related species, though sometimes under very specialized circumstances.",11
430,The scientific method may sometimes mislead.,11
431,We commonly test for the selective value of a particular feature by holding background variation of both genotype and environment at a minimum.,11
432,We thereby maximise our chance of demonstrating what we are looking for.,11
433,The real measure should be whether selection is significant against normal levels of background variation.,11
434,This is why it was important to test the effects of cyanogenesis and reaction to neighbours .,11
435,It is difficult to believe that any of the characters examined by Burdon could be selectively neutral.,11
436,"However, the contribution of each property to fitness must vary dramatically from year to year from place to place within the field.",11
437,Most winters at Henfaes (only 400 m from the sea) are mild and frost is rare.,11
438,"Occasionally, as in the winter of 1982, there is severe frost.",11
439,Populations of molluscs fluctuate wildly from year to year in North Wales.,11
440,In some years spring growth of the sward is vigorous and exceeds the capacity of sheep and the other grazing animals to keep it fully grazed.,11
441,"In other years, as in the spring of 1982, a protracted spring drought slowed the growth of the sward and it became tightly graze.",11
442,A severe drought is not a common feature on the field but when it occurs it may be in any month from April to September.,11
443,"During the period of our observations we have detected three significant leaf pathogens on white clover in the field,and .",11
444,It seems unlikely that these three diseases attack with equal intensity in all seasons and in all years.,11
445,"In a field that is patchy in space and time, be it small, we may expect that the populations of a species white clover will, at any time, reflect selective forces from its past.",11
446,The genotypic composition of the population may in some cases dimly reflect forces that operated twenty or thirty years ago.,11
447,Other selective forces may have operated quite recently and left a strong memory or image in the structure of the population's genetics.,11
448,"If this is the case, we would expect to find only a few of the many polymorphisms readily interpretable as responsive to present proximal selective forces.",11
449,"Much of the polymorphism  could be transient and, without an even more detailed history of the field, uninterpretable.",11
450,"It is doubtful whether such an explanation of naturally occurring polymorphism could be tested without long-term, detailed recording, not only of the variety of genetic changes occurring within clover populations, but at the same time of a detailed recording of the known hazards in the life of the clover plant over the seasons and the years.",11
451,Conclusions,11
452,"The studies that I have described, concentrated in the field at Henfaes, are now being extended by deliberate experimentation within the field.",11
453,"We are destroying the site as a long-term study on a supposedly stable system by introducing a variety of perturbations transplant experiments, the creation of islands for invasion and further perturbations are planned.",11
454,The study has involved a curious concentration of effort in one very specialized environment.,11
455,The type of observations that have been made have been quintessentially Darwinian.,11
456,"Another great naturalist, Thoreau, has focussed attention at the same scale: ‘Nature will bear the closest inspection.",11
457,"She invites us to lay our eye level with her smallest leaf, and take an insect-view of its plain'.",11
458,If we are to see evolutionary processes in action in plant communities and the proximal events determining their character we must focus our attention an anthropomorphic scale of acres or square metres and onto a scale appropriate to the organisms with which we are concerned.,11
459,The appropriate scale is determined by the organism and not by us.,11
460,It will be different for different species.,11
461,"We ask for a plant's eye view of life and death in a sward and hope ultimately to be able to collect these reductionist observations into statements about the population, the species or even possibly the community.",11
462,I doubt if it is possible to hold the view of Margalef (1968) that ‘Relevant evidence does not consist of a massive accumulation of trivia’ and reconcile it with his ‘Ecology…is the study of systems at a level at which individuals or whole organisms may be considered elements of interaction…’.,11
463,"It was, indeed, from the massive accumulation of trivia and tiny details, that Darwin assembled the evidence for .",11
464,"In a volume commemorating Darwin's death, I have tried to show how his way of looking at the behaviour of individual plants in nature can be extended.",11
465,A hundred years after his death his approach seems more relevant to botanical studies than it has ever been.,11
466,This part of his intellectual legacy has not yet been fully invested.,11
467,"A part of the legacy, however, ceases to bear interest.",11
468,"He was writing in the for readers  most of whom were steeped in Victorian optimism, religion and the romantic movement.",11
469,"It was necessary in 1859 to write about the process of evolution it produced the best of all possible worlds, a substitute for the finger of the Almighty at work.",11
470,If the process of evolution had not been presented in this way (though with careful caveats) it is very questionable whether it could have been accepted so rapidly by Victorian society.,11
471,"It was then appropriate to show how ‘…from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved’.",11
472,But ‘beauty’ and ‘wonder’are in the eye of the beholder and that eye has itself evolved.,11
473,The teleology of evolution as a goal-seeking activity persists in indefensible form a hundred years later in the writing of biologists.,11
474,This particular heritage may be a millstone around the neck of scientific natural history.,11
475,"Most particularly, it harms biology as a means of teaching science to the young (Harper, 1982).",11
476,"Looking back at the variety of studies conducted on plants in the little field at Henfaes, I feel little temptation to explain the behaviour of organisms within it as perfectly fitted for adaptive optima in an ideally evolved ecosystem.",11
477,"Rather, I see the population of plants trapped in narrowly constrained evolved ruts, bearing the battered imprint of recent and not-so-recent selective and other forces.",11
478,"‘I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, not yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all’().",11
479,PLATE TECTONICS AND EVOLUTION A. HALLAM,11
480,In his famous concluding paragraph of Darwin expressed wonder that the diversity of the organic world can have been produced from one or a few ancestors by the operation of several natural laws —‘there is grandeur in this view of life…’.,11
481,"The preferential replication of genes natural selection may well be a necessary condition for evolution to take place, but it is hardly a sufficient explanation for how the enormous diversity of life in space and time has come about.",11
482,"That there are, , kangaroos in Australia and lemurs in Madagascar, and that antelopes dinosaurs currently roam the plains of Africa, is among other things consequent upon a whole series of historical contingencies.",11
483,The study of palaeontology geology ought to throw light on the interaction of historical events and the evolution of a substantial sample of the organisms that have inhabited this planet.,11
484,Darwin viewed biotic interactions — the struggle for existence — as being the major promoter of evolution.,11
485,This is clearly indicated in the following passage from .,11
486,"‘As species are produced and exterminated by slowly acting causes, and not by miraculous acts of creation; and as the most important of all causes of organic change is one which is almost independent of altered and perhaps suddenly altered physical conditions, namely, the mutual relation of organism to organism — the improvement of one organism entailing the improvement or the extermination of others’.",11
487,"Such a view would imply, , that the mammals progressively outcompeted the dinosaurs in the late Mesozoic to become the dominant terrestrial vertebrates in the early Tertiary.",11
488,We have known for some time that this cannot have been the case.,11
489,"For many millions of years, through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, primitive mammals coexisted with  dinosaurs, but remained low in diversity and small in size.",11
490,"Not until after the dinosaurs finally became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous did the mammals radiate explosively into a great diversity of forms we see today, to occupy an even wider range of ecological niches than those vacated by the dinosaurs.",11
491,It is quite likely that the early mammals were nocturnal in habit and thereby avoided direct competition with the smaller dinosaurs.,11
492,"With hindsight we can envisage them as biding their time, , until their reptilian competitors disappeared.",11
493,"This pattern of change is exceptional in the fossil record (see, , Gould & Calloway, 1980).",11
494,"Indeed it seems to be rather characteristic, as is the close coincidence in time of episodes of mass extinction and radiation of a wide variety of animal and plant groups, both terrestrial and marine.",11
495,There is a clear implication that such significant evolutionary episodes may be the consequence of major physical events in earth history.,11
496,"Following the earth sciences revolution within the last couple of decades (Hallam, 1973) it is natural to investigate what relationship, if any, exists between major biogeographic, radiation and extinction episodes and plate tectonics, which appear to have controlled first order events in the physical environment for a diverse metazoan fauna became established in the Cambrian, nearly six hundred million years ago.",11
497,"my limited space, I can do no more, , than outline some of the more significant features as they are currently understood.",11
498,Physical effects of plate movements,11
499,"The theory of plate tectonics states that the outer layer of the earth, the (–100 km thick) comprises a small number of (relatively) rigid which are separated by narrow zones along which most tectonic, seismic and volcanic activity is concentrated.",11
500,"These are of three types:(1), where crustal material moves apart, under the oceans by a process known as sea-floor spreading;(2), where one plate plunges down into the underlying mantle (also known as );(3), where one plate slides laterally its neighbour, crust being here neither created (1) nor destroyed (2)(Fig. 18.1).",11
501,"The most obvious effect of plate tectonics is that continents can be split and their components driven apart if a divergent plate margin becomes established beneath them, and can be caused to collide with along the lines of subduction zones, where mountain belts the  Himalayas may thereby be generated.",11
502,"Other mountain belts the Andes are also produced by subduction but at the boundary of continent and ocean floor, which have very different geological character.",11
503,Plate tectonics is not the same as continental drift.,11
504,Continents are carried passively on moving sectors of plates which also embrace ocean floor; they do not ‘drift’ across the latter (Fig. 18.2).,11
505,"Migrating continents have obvious implications for biogeography and evolution, but there are other consequences of plate movements which may alter the physical environment in such a way as to affect the biosphere just as profoundly.",11
506,"Firstly, it is widely accepted, though admittedly not conclusively established, that major ice ages may result from the siting of large continental masses in the polar regions, because only in such circumstances can extensive ice sheets become established, with significant consequences for world climate (Frakes, 1979).",11
507,"In Phanerozoic time (the time which has elapsed since the beginning of the Cambrian) there have been three such ice ages, separated by intervals of a few hundred million years when the world enjoyed a more equable climate and lacked extensive polar ice caps.",11
508,"Such a gross cyclicity is not, , to be confused with the much shorter-phase climatic cycles within the most recent, Pleistocene, ice age, which appear to be the consequence of an interaction of several astronomical variables (Imbrie & Imbrie, 1979).",11
509,The short-term climatic fluctuations of the Pleistocene have resulted in rapid world-wide (or ) falls and rises of sea level as polar ice has alternately frozen and melted.,11
510,"The stratigraphic record indicates, however, that eustatic changes have also occurred during the long equable periods when the available evidence suggests that polar ice was absent.",11
511,These sea-level fluctuations must therefore have been produced by changes in the cubic capacity of the ocean basins.,11
512,"By plotting the areal distribution of marine strata and making reasonable inferences from facies distributions about the location of former shorelines, it has been established that for long periods of time in the Phanerozoic, especially in the early Palaeozoic and late Cretaceous, the continents have been inundated by two thirds of the present area by .",11
513,"The present shelf, or neritic zone, is in comparison a mere pericontinental fringe (Hallam, 1981c).",11
514,the most effective way of changing the cubic capacity of the ocean basins is to vary the volume of the mid-ocean ridges; increase in volume will cause a displacement of sea water the continents and .,11
515,"One popular hypothesis has it that variations in rates of sea-floor spreading are the controlling factor (Hays & Pitman, 1973).",11
516,"Since ocean-floor basalt subsides as it cools while migrating the spreading axis, a faster-spreading ridge will be hotter and more buoyant over a larger area and hence will cause more displacement of sea water over the continents.",11
517,"The rate of eustatic change  by this process has been estimated to be about three orders of magnitude slower than that produced by the climatically induced fluctuations of the Pleistocene (Pitman, 1978).",11
518,"Alternatively, eustatic changes in non-glacial periods can be produced by changes in the cumulative length of active spreading ridges, which will obviously relate to changes in plate patterns (Hallam, 1977).",11
519,Epicontinental seas have been biologically significant for several reasons.,11
520,"They were the site of habitation of a very large proportion of all adult aquatic organisms, and, their overall shallowness — generally less than (and often much less than) 200 m — quite modest eustatic and other physical changes may have had disproportionately large environmental consequences compared with the open ocean.",11
521,"Furthermore, extensive spreads of such seas can as effectively isolate pieces of emergent continent as spreading ocean floor, thereby creating barriers to migration of terrestrial organisms, and should also promote equability of the continental climate.",11
522,It has recently been proposed that variations in albedo latitude (with considerable consequences for global climate) are a result of both the changing distribution of continents and sea-level oscillations.,11
523,"The latter, causing a change in land-sea proportions, is apparently the more important (Barron, Sloan & Harrison, 1980).",11
524,The organic response,11
525,"For the purposes of a general survey, changes in various biological groups through time are most usefully analysed (or, more strictly, taxonomic ), and changes in spatial distribution by the amount of provinciality or .",11
526,"Obviously, significant radiations will appear as marked increases, and extinctions as decreases of diversity, while the degree to which free migration is inhibited by geographic barriers, thereby promoting genetic isolation the classic model (Mayr, 1963), should be expressed by the ratio of endemic to pandemic organisms.",11
527,"Pioneer attempts to relate temporal diversity changes to plate tectonics were undertaken by Valentine & Moores (1972) and Flessa & Imbrie (1973), while the relationship of changing patterns of endemism through time plate movements was outlined by Hallam (1974).",11
528,"For more up-to-date palaeobiogeographic reviews see Gray & Boucot (1979) and Hallam (1981a, b).",11
529,The organic response to the changes in the physical environment induced by plate tectonics can be considered under three headings.,11
530,Migrating continents,11
531,I have proposed four simple distributional patterns for both marine and terrestrial animals which involve changes in time.,11
532,"(not to be confused with phyletic convergence) refers to the degree of resemblance of faunas in different regions increasing from an earlier to a later period, and refers to the reverse phenomenon (Fig. 18. 3).",11
533,refers to a type of regionally restricted distribution of a fossil taxon in which two or more component parts are separated by a major physical barrier and hence is not readily explicable present-day geography.,11
534,in the distributional changes of contiguous marine and terrestrial animals is recognisable when one group exhibits convergence and the other divergence (Fig. 18.4).,11
535,"This happens, , when a land connection is created between two hitherto isolated areas of continent, so allowing convergence of the terrestrial faunas to take place, while severing of a once-continuous landmass gives rise to divergence as a result of genetic isolation.",11
536,"Pliocene uplift of the isthmus linking North and South America, apparently related to movement of the Cocos Plate in the East Pacific, is a classic example of complementarity and is also significant from a Darwinian point of view.",11
537,Substantial cross-migration of terrestrial mammal faunas coincided with mass extinction of the endemic South  American mammals which had been isolated by sea through Tertiary times.,11
538,"This has generally been assumed to have been the result of competition from the adaptively superior North American mammals, but Marshall (1981) has recently argued that some of the extinction was caused by changes in the physical environment.",11
539,"In contrast, the Australian marsupial fauna has remained isolated by sea and not until late Tertiary times, when Australia-New Guinea had moved close to the Indonesian islands, was even limited and chance colonisation possible of Asian placentals across small water barriers (Whitmore, 1981).",11
540,"More generally, the substantial diversity increase of faunas through the   Mesozoic and Cainozoic, accelerating from mid-Cretaceous times onwards, which has recently been confirmed statistically (Sepkoski, Bambach, Raup & Valentine, 198 1), is evidently related in substantial part to the progressive break-up of the late Palaeozoic-early Mesozoic supercontinent known as Pangaea, with the consequent increase in endemism of both terrestrial and neritic groups (Valentine, 1973).",11
541,Sea-level changes,11
542,"Among the multiplicity of causes proposed to account for mass extinction events, both terrestrial and extra-terrestrial, strong supporting evidence for a succession of such events is available for only one, related to eustatic changes of sea level (Fig. 18.5).",11
543,"Whether the extinctions among neritic organisms were the consequence of regression of epicontinental seas (Newell, 1967) or the widespread bottom-water anoxia characteristic of the initial phase of subsequent transgression (Hallam, 1981c) a significant   reduction of habitat area and hence deterioration of the environment would have been produced by either phenomenon.",11
544,"the most important episode of mass extinction took place at the end of the Permian period (Sepkoski .,",11
545,"1981), when it is estimated that as many as 96% of all marine species died out (Raup, 1979).",11
546,"Schopf (1974) and Simberloff (1974) have demonstrated that diversity changes of marine invertebrates across the Permian-Triassic boundary correlate closely with areas of epicontinental sea, in fact seem to obey rather well the ecologists' well known ‘species-area’ relationship.",11
547,"The even more familiar end-Cretaceous mass extinction event is also associated with substantial regression (Fig. 18.5), as are the equally striking events in the marine realm at or near the end of the Ordovician and Triassic, and to a lesser extent the Devonian (Raup & Sepkoski, 1982, and Fig. 18.6).",11
548,"It is clear, however, with what particular plate tectonic events they may have been associated, either directly or indirectly.",11
549,The end-Ordovician regression is indeed widely thought to be the result of the growth of a Saharan ice sheet.,11
550,The question may be raised: to what extent were the extinctions selective or random?,11
551,Computer mode fling exercises have persuaded Raup (1981) that for the important group of trilobites it was more a matter of ‘bad genes’ than ‘bad luck’.,11
552,"On the other hand, a species extinction rate for the end of the Permian as high as 96% implies that the role of chance may in extreme cases have been dominant (Raup, 1979).",11
553,"Generally speaking, organisms in warm, shallow seas that either build or are closely associated with reefs have been relatively vulnerable to extinction, as have planktonic foraminifera and ammonites, which have undergone a succession of ‘boom and bust’ cycles (Vermeij, 1978; Haliam, 1981c).",11
554,"Among terrestrial vertebrates (some marine invertebrates) large organisms have been more vulnerable (Bakker, 1977).",11
555,"phases of spectacular radiation, the two most important in the Phanerozoic record, affecting a large variety of organisms, correlate closely with major physical events that appear ultimately to be bound up with plate tectonics.",11
556,"The radiation of marine faunas following the massive end-Palaeozoic extinctions was a long-continuing, progressive phenomenon, but was marked by a pulse of acceleration and replacement in the mid-Cretaceous, with diversity increase continuing into the Cainozoic (Fig. 18.6).",11
557,The better known end-Cretaceous extinction event can in many respects be considered as a mere temporary setback in this very dramatic faunal change.,11
558,"The more-or-less coincident, spectacular mid-Cretaceous radiations included teleost fish, infaunal veneroid bivalves, carnivorous neogastropods and crabs (Vermeij, 1977; Stanley, 1977).",11
559,"There were contemporary radiations of plankton, including coccolithophores, foraminifera, diatoms and dinoflagellates (Lipps, 1970) and deep-sea ichnofauna (Frey 7and; Seilacher, 19801, while on land the angiosperms rapidly replaced the gymnosperms as the dominant plants (Doyle, 1977).",11
560,"It can hardly be coincidental that these remarkable evolutionary events, taking place within only a few million years, correspond so closely in time with an episode of exceptional igneous and urogenic activity (Larsen & Pitman, 1972), the rapid disintegration of Pangaea (Hallam, 1980) and the biggest marine transgression since the mid-Palaeozoic, apparently produced either by a phase of accelerated sea-floor spreading or by a dramatic increase in the length of the ocean ridge system.",11
561,", plankton evolution could perhaps have been stimulated by a drastic change in ocean current systems consequent upon Pangaea breakup, but the sea-level rise might have been just as significant.",11
562,Thus Hart (1980) has put forward a factually well-supported model relating the explosive diversification of late Cretaceous planktonic foraminifera to increasing depth of epicontinental seas.,11
563,"This is a surprising conclusion with intriguing implications, bearing in mind the problem of near total extinction of this group at the end of the Cretaceous, which has appeared to be an even greater enigma than the contemporary extinction of the dinosaurs.",11
564,"The latter might well have suffered from an increase in continentality of climate following regression, but it has not unreasonably been assumed by most palaeontologists that a planktonic group the globigerinid foraminifera should have been indifferent to what was happening to epicontinental seas.",11
565,"Darwin was troubled by the sudden appearance of a wide diversity of fossils in the Cambrian, and tentatively suggested that there might have  been a long interval this period when no stratal record was preserved on the continents.",11
566,"For a variety of reasons this type of explanation must be rejected today and the explosive diversification of Metazoa across the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary, as recorded in the strata, is now generally accepted as being a true reflection of what actually happened (Stanley, 1976; Seilacher, 1977).",11
567,This diversification has been shown to correspond closely to a simple exponential growth model.,11
568,"As the number of taxa increased the rate of diversification seems to have become diversity-dependent (Sepkoski, 1978).",11
569,"The close correspondence of diversity increase with rise of sea level in the Cambrian suggests the possibility of a causal correlation (Brasier, 1979).",11
570,"We lack the information necessary to relate it with confidence to specific plate tectonic events, as is possible for the Cretaceous, but the Cambrian sea-level rise might well have been a consequence of opening of the Iapetus Ocean, with the growth of a spreading ridge (Anderton, 1980, 1982).",11
571,Climatic change,11
572,"The pronounced increase in latitudinal temperature zonation through the course of the Cainozoic, as the world altered progressively from its Mesozoic condition of equability, must have had the effect of creating a great number of ecological niches.",11
573,"This is seen as a major factor contributing towards the marked increase in faunal diversity (Valentine, 1973).",11
574,Increase in annual temperature range on the continents as a consequence of regression of epicontinental seas might well have played a significant role in the mass extinctions of large reptiles at the end of the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic.,11
575,"Pangaea at the end of the Palaeozoic must have experienced a climate of extreme continentality, not only its coherence (Valentine & Moores, 1972) but the high albedo of extensive low-latitude deserts (Barron .,",11
576,1980).,11
577,"The extinction of many marine foraminiferal and ostracode species at or close to the Eocene-Oligocene boundary could be bound up with the establishment of the layer of cold, deep water in the oceans known as the psychrosphere.",11
578,"This in turn relates to the establishment of the Circum-Antarctic current as first Australia and then South America broke that continent, and to the formation of south polar sea ice (Hallam, 1981c).",11
579,Discussion,11
580,"I should now like to broaden the scope of this essay by discussing the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic, biotic and physical, factors as promoters of evolution.",11
581,In recent years there has been an increasing tendency in some circles to investigate the evolutionary record of fossils general rules and processes without regard to specific causes operating on specific taxa.,11
582,"Thus Van Valen (1973) applied the survivorship curve technique of population biologists to the study of extinction rates for numerous fossil taxa, and claimed to demonstrate a general approximation to linearity in his curves, which are cumulative frequency distributions of taxonomic durations with logarithmic ordinates.",11
583,"This led him to propose a new evolutionary ‘law’, which, , states that within a relatively homogeneous higher taxon, subtaxa tend to become extinct at a stochastically constant rate.",11
584,"In explanation Van Valen put forward what he termed the Red Queen's hypothesis, named after the Lewis Carroll character who found it took all the running one can do to keep in the same place.",11
585,It is thoroughly Darwinian in its stress on the paramount importance of biotic interactions.,11
586,All species within a given adaptive zone compete intensively.,11
587,"A successful adaptive response by one species is assumed to occur at the expense of other species, which must either adapt by themselves speciating or become extinct, as the ‘quality’ of their environment is reduced.",11
588,This phenomenon leads to an endless chain of adaptive responses and in the long run means that fitness and rate of extinction remain constant.,11
589,"The high rate of diversification and evolutionary turnover in mammals is thought likely to be the result of a variety of factors, strong competitive interactions leading to specialisation in feeding methods, limitations on food supply, high mobility and energy use, interspecific aggression and territoriality.",11
590,"Such factors will conspire to lower the ‘resource threshold’ needed to prevent extinction, compared with other animals.",11
591,Epistandard rates of evolution are required to make up the loss through extinction.,11
592,"Though the Red Queen model could conceivably apply to mammals, there are doubts about its more general validity.",11
593,Thus Stanley (1973) analyses the effect of competition on evolutionary rates by comparing mammals with bivalve molluscs.,11
594,"In sharp contrast to mammals, bivalves are nearly all benthic suspension feeders which appear to mind their own business, being characterized by weak interactions with other species, primitive inflexible behaviour, uncrowded, largely sedentary mode of life and generalised feeding habits.",11
595,"Limits on bivalve populations are imposed more by predation and fluctuations in the physical environment than by food resources, and biotic competition is minimal.",11
596,"As Stanley remarks laconically, ‘Interspecific aggression is not characteristic of bivalve behaviour’.",11
597,What is true of bivalves is without much doubt true of the majority of benthic invertebrates.,11
598,"More general criticisms of the Red Queen hypothesis have been voiced by Foin, Valentine & Ayala (1975), Raup (1975), Salthe (1975) and Sepkoski (1975).",11
599,"In a nutshell, it is argued that either Van Valen's results show linearity with time, which is held to be biologically without significance, or most do not, in which case Van Valen's ‘law’ breaks down.",11
600,"Other stochastic models have been explored by the computer generation of phylogenetic diagrams (cladograms), with termination and branching events being controlled using random numbers (Raup .,",11
601,"1973; Gould .,",11
602,1977).,11
603,Part of the input dealt with the required establishment of an equilibrium diversity.,11
604,"The cladograms so produced displayed a variety of patterns, many of which appear to simulate temporal diversity changes in well-studied fossil groups.",11
605,"It does not, , follow that the radiation and extinction of the monophyletic units known as clades do not have deterministic explanations.",11
606,"Stanley, Signor, Lidgard & Karr (1981) present some cogent criticism of the work of Raup and his associates and establish that chance factors have not played a dominant role in producing dramatic changes in diversity.",11
607,Hoffman (1981) gives a sophisticated critique both of stochastic modelling and the application of equilibrium theory in palaeontology.,11
608,"The most powerful case against randomness is that afforded by mass extinction and radiation events, whereby a wide variety of taxonomic groups with different modes of life, and effective biological independence, have experienced synchronised diversity reduction or increase.",11
609,"This strongly implies the operation of some form of control by the physical environment, and some likely examples of an ultimate link with plate tectonics have been presented above.",11
610,"The interesting question arises: were the several widely acknowledged major episodes of mass extinction in the Phanerozoic caused by exceptional events different in kind from what occurred in the much lengthier intervening periods, or are they merely the spectacular end-members of a whole series?",11
611,"Those who have recourse to the of lethal rays or thunderbolts from outer space may incline to the former view, but only at the expense of disregarding the abundant evidence in the stratigraphic  record of a correlation between mass extinctions and physical events on earth (Hallam, 1981c).",11
612,"Even in the one case where independent evidence is claimed in the form of an abnormal enrichment in thin sedimentary layers of iridium and other platinum group metals, namely the much-publicized asteroid impact hypothesis for the end-Cretaceous extinctions (Alvarez, Alvarez, Asaro & Michel, 1980) serious doubts have been raised by a careful analysis of some key palaeontological evidence (Clemens, Archibald & Hickey, 1981).",11
613,"There is in fact evidence to indicate that regressions at intermediate and small scales correlate with coordinated extinction events in particular fossil groups (e.g. Hallam, 1978; Williamson, 1981) but much more work is required to establish how generally such a relationship holds.",11
614,"If it does turn out to be of general significance at a variety of scales it will imply that the increased environmental stress associated in some way with regressions promotes an increase in extinction rate and corresponding vacation of ecological niches, with a consequent opportunity for new species to establish themselves.",11
615,"Alternatively, or in association, it could be that the pronounced environmental changes associated with the regression events act to destabilize intraspecific selection pressures and hence promote speciation.",11
616,The comparatively long time intervals between such environmental vicissitudes may be characterized by stasis in ecosystems the component species.,11
617,"A brief consideration of the well-documented Pleistocene sea-level oscillations caused by glaciation and deglaciation suggests an apparent problem, because these events do not, , correlate with episodes of pronounced extinction or speciation.",11
618,"Indeed, the characteristic response of both terrestrial and marine organisms to the pronounced climatic changes of the Pleistocene has been to migrate to ecological refuges, in effect to track their environment.",11
619,"Without such a phenomenon, in fact, stratigraphic correlation would operate under a crippling handicap.",11
620,Why therefore did not organisms respond in a similar way to the much slower changes of sea level in the lengthy periods of climatic equability?,11
621,two possibilities readily suggest themselves.,11
622,"Perhaps the Pleistocene sea-level falls, though dramatically rapid in geological terms, were too short-lived to have the kind of environmental impact required to cause extinction.",11
623,Or perhaps the increasingly unstable environments of the late Cainozoic associated with climatic deterioration caused a selection for eurytopic organisms well adapted to withstand environmental instability.,11
624,"In contrast, the comparative stability of, , Mesozoic environments might have allowed the establishment of complex ecosystems  characterized by comparatively stenotopic organisms, which would have been vulnerable to even modest environmental vicissitudes.",11
625,"Such ideas need to be tested, and further studies made on the relative susceptibility of different fossil groups to extinction as a result of particular environmental events.",11
626,"Furthermore, we need to enquire further into the factors governing the response of organisms to given disturbances of their environment, whether it involves migration to refuges or extinction and speciation.",11
627,There is clearly a rich field for future investigation into matters of such major importance.,11
628,"Though I believe that Darwin laid too much stress on biotic interactions as a promoter of evolution and extinction, to the extent of substantially dismissing changes in the physical environment, there is no justification for going to the other extreme, as several examples will illustrate.",11
629,"That the South American mammals might have gone extinct in the early Pleistocene as a consequence of competition from the North American invaders has already been noted, though we should take due account of the caveats of Marshall (1981).",11
630,"marine benthic communities, the expansion of mobile, infaunal deposit- and suspension-feeding populations in the Mesozoic correlates with a decline of immobile suspension feeders on soft substrates (Thayer, 1979).",11
631,"Some of the groups in decline, stalked crinoids, cidaroid echinoids (Kier, 1974) and brachiopods, apparently sought refuge in the deep sea.",11
632,"The late Mesozoic radiation of predatory crabs, neogastropods and teleosts correlates with an increase in resistance to destruction of the shells of their molluscan prey (Vermeij, 1977; Ward, 1981).",11
633,Further likely examples of coevolution concern the rise of the angiosperms.,11
634,"From the late Cretaceous onwards the new sea-grass communities transformed the shallow neritic environment and seem to have promoted the contemporary radiation of deposit-feeding and epiphytic gastropods and miliolid foraminifera (Brasier, 1975).",11
635,"Although the fossil record is much poorer, coevolution with the terrestrial angiosperms probably accounts for a major component of the radiation of insects and birds.",11
636,"In all these cases, however, the initial trigger to change might have been physical biotic.",11
637,"A final intriguing example involves a subtle interplay between biotic and physical factors, and concerns the common phyletic trend towards size increase known as Cope's Rule, which I suspect may be the only important gradualistic exception to punctuated equilibria (Hallam, 1978).",11
638,"There is no shortage of adaptive explanations for size increase, but Darwin is one of the few to have pointed out that large organisms mastodonts and dinosaurs would have been more vulnerable to extinction the limitations of food resources.",11
639,"I have proposed that, on the reasonable assumption that resources remained more or constant for the time in question, the price exacted for (phyletically) growing larger was to become rarer, thereby increasing the probability of extinction (Hallam, 1975).",11
640,"Whether one applies the older notion of a trend from less to more specialized or the newer concept of a trend from an r-to a K-selected adaptive strategy (ecologists seem to have a love-hate relationship towards r and K selection (Dawkins, 1981)), the phyletically younger organisms would have become progressively more vulnerable to environmental disturbance.",11
641,"The stratigraphic record has been compared to the traditional life of a soldier — long periods of boredom interrupted by moments of terror (Ager, 1973).",11
642,The fossil record suggests that the largest members of a phyletic series usually had the most reason to be apprehensive of the future.,11
643,SELECTION SEX T.H. CLUTTON-BROCK,11
644,"In many animal species, differences between the sexes are pronounced.",11
645,"In fact, there are relatively few morphological, physiological or behavioural characteristics that do not differ to some extent between males and females (see Glucksman, 1974) and the extent of these differences varies widely between species.",11
646,", sexual differences in body size range from species, like worms of the genus , where females can be over 25 times the length of males (Barnes, 1974) to species like the southern elephant seal,, where mature males average eight times the weight of females (Bryden, 1969).",11
647,"Other sex differences are less apparent — those in fat deposition, in haemoglobin levels and in metabolic rate among mammals (see Glucksman, 1974) or those in auditory apparatus among frogs (Narins & Capranica, 1976, 1978).",11
648,"And many have only recently been explored: , recent research shows that in some species there are pronounced sex differences in feeding ecology (Gautier-Hion, 1980) in the effects of starvation on survival (Widdowson, 1976).",11
649,"It was to provide an explanation for the evolution of sex differences that Charles Darwin formulated the theory of sexual selection, described first in (1859) and later, in greater depth, in (1871).",11
650,"In this chapter, I briefly trace the development of the theory and describe recent attempts to measure variation in reproductive success in males and females, some of the practical problems involved.",11
651,"However, as I argue in the final section, the extent of sexual dimorphism will depend not on the extent to which reproductive success varies in the two sexes but on the comparative effects of particular phenotypic traits on the breeding success of males and females.",11
652,A brief history of sexual selection,11
653,"The origin of the theory of sexual selection can be traced to a peacock — or, rather, a peahen owned by Lady Tynte.",11
654,"This bird, born around 1762, lived in such comfortable circumstances that it had already reared eight broods when, to the consternation of its noble owner, it suddenly developed the plumage and spurs of a male and thereafter refused to lay another egg.",11
655,"No possible confusion of identities could have occurred since Lady Tynte was able to recognize her favourite by the nobs on its toes, which were unaffected by its change in appearance (Hunter, 1837).",11
656,"It is not known whether Lady Tynte investigated just what had happened to the bird's genitalia but subsequent studies of female pheasants showing similar transvestite tendencies revealed that only sexual differences developing at or after puberty were affected and that the reproductive organs themselves remained unaltered (Yarrell, 1827).",11
657,"This finally led John Hunter, the eminent surgeon, anatomist and classifier of monsters to produce a seminal paper (Hunter, 1837) in which he proposed that differences between the sexes were of two kinds: those involving the sexual organs themselves, which were evident from birth and did not change during an individual's lifetime; and those that did not develop until the animal approached breeding age, differences in body size, plumage and in the tendency to be fat which he termed ‘secondary’ marks or characters of sex (Hunter, 1837, 1861).",11
658,"Some of these, like the plumage of gallinaceous birds, could change during an individual's lifetime but these differences were not evident at birth.",11
659,Hunter realized both that ‘secondary’ sexual characters were functionally related to fighting or display and that their extent varied with ecology.,11
660,Hunter's distinction between primary and secondary sexual characters was adopted by Charles Darwin (1871) with a subtle distinction.,11
661,Darwin was aware that many ‘secondary’ sex differences were evident at birth (or  hatching) and distinguished between the two categories on functional on ontogenetic grounds.,11
662,Darwin's primary sexual characters were those connected with the act of reproduction itself while secondary sexual characters were used in acquiring mating partners.,11
663,"To these two categories, Darwin added a third: sex differences ‘related to different habits of life, and not , or only indirectly, to the reproductive functions’, among which he included structures associated with sex differences in feeding behaviour (Darwin, 1871).",11
664,The theory of sexual selection was intended to provide an explanation only of secondary sexual characteristics.,11
665,Darwin realized that many secondary sexual differences were a consequence of the greater intensity of competition between males for access to mates and that many traits were more highly developed in males either because they conferred an advantage in fights or because they rendered their possessor more attractive to females.,11
666,He distinguished sexual selection from natural selection on two grounds:.,11
667,"first, that it was a consequence of competition between members of the same sex between members of different sexes or species; and, second, that it depended on variation in reproductive success survival.",11
668,"‘…This form of selection depends, not on a struggle for existence other organic beings or to external conditions, but on a struggle between the individuals of one sex, generally the males, for the possession of the other sex.",11
669,The result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor but few or no offspring.’,11
670,Darwin's theory of sexual selection was less readily accepted by scientists than the theory of natural selection.,11
671,"Wallace (1889) agreed that combat between males was an important source of selection pressures leading to sexual dimorphism but regarded this as a form of selection on the grounds that it increased ‘the vigour and fighting power of the male animal, since, in every case, the weaker are either killed, wounded or driven away’.",11
672,"He regarded Darwin's second mode of sexual selection — female choice of particular males — as unimportant on the grounds that any consequences which female choice might have would be annulled by natural selection — unless females selected the fittest males, in which case the results of sexual and natural selection would be inseparable.",11
673,He also  pointed to the lack of evidence of consistent female choice for mates carrying particular characteristics.,11
674,"Some fifty years later, the same points were reaffirmed in two influential papers by Huxley (1938a, b).",11
675,"Wallace's objection that sexual selection is a form of natural selection is semantically correct — after all, Darwin originally coined the term ‘natural selection’ to mark its relation to power of selection, and the opposite of natural selection is not sexual but artificial selection (see Brown, 1975; Halliday, 1978).",11
676,"However, his insistence that the process of sexual selection described by Darwin could only increase the average reproductive success or survival of males is clearly wrong (Lande, 1980).",11
677,"Especially in polygynous species, the costs of combat are frequently high (Geist, 1971; Clutton-Brock, Albon, Gibson & Guinness, 1979) and so, too are the costs of many sexually dimorphic characters associated with combat, increased male body size and weapon development (Clutton-Brock, Guinness & Albon, 1982): in species where males are substantially larger than females, both growing and adult males are often more likely to die than females (Robinette, Gashwiler, Low & Jones, 1957; Grubb, 1974; Howe, 1977) and in one reindeer population which crashed from 6000 to 42, only one of the remaining adults was a male (Klein, 1968).",11
678,"Sexual selection on males may also reduce the average fitness of females (Lande, 1980): in species where adult males are substantially larger than females, producing sons appears to depress the mother's subsequent reproductive success more than producing daughters (Clutton-Brock, Albon & Guinness, 1981).",11
679,Wallace's theoretical objections to the importance of female choice as a source of sexual selection on males can also be discounted.,11
680,R. A. Fisher (1930) demonstrated that female choice for particular male characteristics (tail size) can cause them to develop to a point at which they reduce the average fitness of males.,11
681,"Subsequent treatments have confirmed Fisher's conclusions (O'Donald, 1980; Lande, 1981) and shown that the process need not depend on the initial female preference favouring more viable males (Kirkpatrick, 1982).",11
682,"However, while there is extensive evidence of assortative mating (O'Donald, 1980), of the importance of plumage characteristics in courtship (Williams, 1982) and of female preference for males who can defend superior breeding territories (Pleszczynska, 1978) only very recently has it been demonstrated that consistent female choice for any continuous morphological character in males is an important source of variation in male reproductive success.",11
683,"By experimental manipulation of tail length in widdow birds of the African genus , Andersson has been able to alter both the extent to which  males are favoured by females and their mating success (Andersson, 1982).",11
684,"This scarcity of evidence does not mean that the evolution of secondary sexual characters through female choice is uncommon, for mating preferences are usually difficult to demonstrate, particularly where inter-male competition is also involved.",11
685,"Nevertheless, the possibility remains that, as Wallace argued, many of the sex differences in plumage and coloration ascribed by Darwin to the action of female choice may have evolved because they help the sexes to recognize or locate or because they improve male success in competitive interactions.",11
686,Measures of sexual selection,11
687,"Darwin was not specific why males should typically compete more strongly for access to breeding partners than females and it was left to biologists of this century to provide the answer (Fisher, 1930; Bateman, 1948; Trivers, 1972).",11
688,The reason why males usually compete more intensely is most easily understood by considering the energetic costs of reproduction to each sex.,11
689,"In most animals, the energetic costs of fertilization to the male are minimal whereas the costs of reproduction to the female are substantial.",11
690,"Consequently, males are capable of fathering more progeny than females can bear and rear: in current terminology (Trivers, 1972) they invest less heavily in their offspring than females.",11
691,"In species where successful males can monopolize breeding access to large numbers of females but similar numbers of males and females are recruited, direct competition between males is likely to be intense, aggressive interactions may be frequent and the selective advantages of possessing traits that affect success in combat may be higher among males than among females.",11
692,"However, neither Trivers' explanation of the prevalence of increased competition among males nor Darwin's description of the theory of sexual selection provide an operational definition of the intensity of sexual selection (Wade, 1979).",11
693,Many different definitions of sexual selection have been proposed but two kinds are in common use.,11
694,"First, some workers argue that the intensity of sexual selection will depend on the variability of reproductive success among males and females.",11
695,", Ralls (1977) argues that ‘the intensity of intrasexual selection in a species should be proportional to the ratio of the lifetime number of offspring sired by a highly successful male compared to the number born by a highly successful female in her lifetime’ while Payne (1979) suggests that the extent to which variance in breeding success differs between the sexes is important.",11
696,"This position is also sometimes mistakenly attributed to Bateman (see Wade & Arnold, 1980).",11
697,"In contrast, other workers use measures of the extent to which male breeding success deviates from mean success as estimates of the intensity of sexual selection on males (see Wade, 1979; Howard, 1979; Wade & Arnold, 1980).",11
698,"Similarly, the intensity of sexual selection in females can be estimated by measuring the extent to which female breeding success deviates from mean female success.",11
699,"Several statistical measures are in use, including the coefficient of variation, Pielou's (1969) index of evenness and variance in breeding success divided by the square of mean breeding success — a measure derived from Crow's (1958) index of the intensity of selection, where V is variance in fitness and W is the mean fitness of the population.",11
700,"This can either be calculated using total variance in breeding success or using only variance attributable to differences in the number of mates per individual (see Wade & Arnold, 1980).",11
701,Ratios of variation in male and female success can be used to estimate the relative rate at which male and female characteristics can change.,11
702,"However, since the extent of variation among females differs widely between species (see below), they are of limited value as measures of the comparative intensity of sexual selection (see Wade & Arnold, 1980).",11
703,"The three measures of the extent to which reproductive success varies within each sex are fundamentally similar though the last is the most convenient since it offers a measure of the potential change in fitness between generations, the average (see Crow, 1958).",11
704,It is still necessary to decide whether to use total variation in breeding success in any calculation or just variation differences in mate number.,11
705,"Where the aim of the calculations is to estimate the potential rate of genetic change, total variance in breeding success is clearly the relevant measure to use.",11
706,"In contrast, where calculations are carried out to assess the comparative importance of differences in reproductive success versus survival for each sex, only variation in mate number may be included (see Wade & Arnold, 1980)— though measures of the intensity of sexual selection as conceived by Darwin should also include variation differences in mate quality, which may be an important cause of variation in lifetime breeding success both among males and females in monogamous species.",11
707,"Lastly, where the aim is to investigate the functional significance of particular phenotypic sex differences, it may be necessary to calculate  selection intensities for specific episodes of selection, mating success at particular ages (see Arnold & Wade, 1983) for the effect of particular traits on lifetime reproductive success may often be obscured by the influence of other variables or by random variation.",11
708,One general point concerning all indices of sexual selection must be emphasized.,11
709,"Since many of the traits affecting breeding success are strongly influenced by rearing conditions (see Clutton-Brock .,",11
710,"1982), these measures reflect the rate of genetic change and may provide little indication of actual rates of change in established populations.",11
711,Practical problems,11
712,"Although it is relatively easy to decide how the intensity of sexual selection should be estimated, collecting the relevant data poses a variety of logistic problems (Ralls, 1977; Davies, 1982).",11
713,", in many polygynous species a proportion of males avoid competing directly with larger or older animals and adopt a policy of surreptitious fertilization or kleptogamy (e.g. Clutton-Brock .,",11
714,"1977; Wirtz, 1982).",11
715,"As a result, it is often difficult to be sure that breeding males fertilize all the females in the groups that they guard: , territorial male red-winged blackbirds () are vasectomized, their females sometimes lay fertile eggs (Bray, Kennelly & Guarino, 1975).",11
716,"Moreover, all indices of the intensity of sexual selection beg a problem of fundamental importance: over what period should reproductive success be measured?",11
717,"It is widely agreed that the lifetime reproductive success of individuals is the most satisfactory measure of fitness that it is usually possible to collect (see Falconer, 1960; Cavalli-Sforza & Bodmer, 1961; Maynard Smith, 1969; Grafen, 1982).",11
718,"This may not always be the case — , in rapidly expanding populations, selection may favour reproductive rate at the expense of lifetime reproductive success (see Lewontin, 1965; Elliot, 1975)— but exceptions are probably rare, especially in long-lived species where variation in longevity greatly exceeds variation in age at first breeding.",11
719,"While many studies of sexual selection pay lip service to the importance of basing calculations on measures of lifetime success, most use estimates of success calculated over a part of the animal's lifespan.",11
720,"The time dimension used varies widely: some studies use measures of instantaneous reproductive success (IRS) calculated across different classes of males at a particular point in time (e.g. Mason, 1964; Scheiring, 1977; McCauley g&, 1980), while others measure dally reproductive success (DRS) or  seasonal reproductive success (SRS)(see Howard, 1979; Payne, 1979).",11
721,"Very recently, estimates of individual variation in lifetime reproductive success (LRS) have become available from field studies of a small number of species, including a territorial and promiscuous invertebrate, the dragonfly (McVey, 1981), two monogamous birds, the great tit,(McGregor, Krebs & Perrins, 1981) and the kittiwake (J. Coulson & C. Thomas, personal communication), and one polygynous mammal, the red deer,(Clutton-Brock .,",11
722,"1982) while in several other species, including sage grouse (: Wiley, 1973) estimates of individual success are available which span several breeding seasons.",11
723,"These make it possible, for the first time, to test the extent to which variation in instantaneous, dally and seasonal reproductive success reflect variation in lifetime success.",11
724,"There appears to be no consistent relationship between variation in IRS, DRS, SRS and LRS (see Table 23. 1).",11
725,There are several reasons why variation in daily reproductive success may not reflect variation in either seasonal or lifetime success.,11
726,In many polygynous species reproductive success varies from hour to hour and day to day and this may cause variation in IRS or DRS to overestimate variation in SRS and LRS.,11
727,", red deer stags which hold a large harem in a sheltered site on one day may have few or no hinds the next day if the wind changes (see Clutton-Brock .,",11
728,1982).,11
729,"As a result, measures of variation in DRS overestimate SRS and LRS in red deer (see Table 23.2).",11
730,Estimates of variation in DRS and SRS in sage grouse () show the same trend though estimates of variation in DRS and LRS were similar in McVey's (1981) study of dragonflies.,11
731,", variation in SRS will not reflect variation in LRS (see Gadgil, 1972) if individuals that breed successfully show reduced success in future or are likely to cease breeding or die earlier than less successful breeders.",11
732,"There is evidence that successful reproduction reduces the future reproductive capabilities or survival of females in several species (e.g. Wooller & Coulson, 1977; Altmann, Altmann & Hausfater, 1978; Guinness, Albon & Clutton-Brock, 1978; Bryant, 1979) and in some species successful males are likely to die before unsuccessful ones (Geist, 1971).",11
733,"However, several other studies have shown that successful breeders live : Partridge & Farquhar, 198 1).",11
734,", in red deer stags, where harem size is one of the principal determinants of reproductive success (Clutton-Brock .,",11
735,"1979, 1982), not only do stags that hold large harems hold them for longer within particular breeding  seasons than those which hold smaller harems (Fig. 23. 1a), but individuals that are consistently successful in securing large harems throughout their lives tend to live longer than their less successful competitors (Fig. 23.1b).",11
736,Trends of this kind will produce an opposite bias and may cause variation in SRS to variation in LRS.,11
737,", the fighting ability and reproductive success of red deer stags shows a pronounced peak between the ages of seven and ten years (see Fig. 23,2).",11
738,"If variation in breeding success is calculated for stags of above a year old (the age of sexual maturity), it greatly exceeds more realistic measures of variation in breeding success variation in seasonal success within cohorts or lifetime success (see Table 23.3).",11
739,This effect will also tend to overestimate variation in male success variation in female success (see Fig. 23.2).,11
740,"A final problem is that unless breeding success is measured across the lifetime, a biased set of males may be sampled.",11
741,"Especially in polygynous species, males that fail to win a breeding territory spend their time on the fringes of the breeding population and often show high mortality.",11
742,The field observer approaching a breeding colony is likely to see mostly (if not only) breeding males.,11
743,"If he calculates the extent to which reproductive success varies across adults that have managed to gain a breeding territory, he will underestimate the real variance since he will exclude non-breeders.",11
744,Dividing by the mean success of males in this sample will accentuate this error since the mean success of the males sampled will be higher than that of the male population as a whole.,11
745,Table 23.4 shows how the restriction of the sample to harem holding males in red deer reduces estimates of daily variation in the number of females held.,11
746,"Estimates that are probably biased in this way are already widespread in the literature (see Trivers, 1976;, Arnold & Wade, 1983).",11
747,"None of these four biases are likely to be consistent either across the two sexes or across different species: all four are more likely to affect estimates of variation in male success than estimates of variation in female success in polygynous species, though in contrary directions.",11
748,"Ignoring short term variation and age effects will tend to overestimate variation in male success variation in female success, which is usually less strongly age-dependent in polygynous species (see Fig. 23.2) and less likely to vary widely from day to day.",11
749,"Conversely, positive correlations between seasonal success and longevity or sampling only successful males will lead to underestimates of variation in male success variation in female success.",11
750,That the two sets of biases oppose is no guarantee that short term measures of reproductive success will provide reliable estimates of variation in lifetime success for the comparative strengths of the different biases probably vary widely too.,11
751,"Moreover, sex differences in the length of effective reproductive lifespans and in the influence of age on breeding success are likely to be more pronounced in polygynous species than in monogamous ones.",11
752,"As a result, short-term estimates of variation in male breeding success are likely to overestimate the extent to which male success varies in polygynous species similar measures for monogamous ones.",11
753,Biased estimates of variation in reproductive success may also cause the effects of particular phenotypic traits on reproductive success to be overestimated.,11
754,"This applies particularly to traits, body size, which are themselves related to age.",11
755,", where the body size and reproductive success of males both increase with age, the effects of size on breeding success may be grossly exaggerated if age differences in size are ignored.",11
756,This effect is again likely to be stronger in males than females.,11
757,The most obvious conclusion to be drawn is the need for studies of the extent to which lifetime success varies and of the factors which affect it.,11
758,"Where this is impossible, an alternative approach is to concentrate on studies of variation in breeding success within cohorts but, even here, problems will arise if breeding success is consistently related to longevity.",11
759,"Polygyny, reproductive success and sexual dimorphism",11
760,The theory of sexual selection has led to four common predictions about the relationship between breeding success and sexual dimorphism.,11
761,Variation in reproductive success should be greater in males than females in polygynous species but similar in the two sexes in monogamous ones.,11
762,"Both in red deer and in , variation in lifetime breeding success is substantially greater among males than females whereas, in kittiwakes, variation is similar in both sexes (Figs. 23.3, 23.4).",11
763,"When the red deer   samples are restricted to animals that reach breeding age, sex differences in the extent to which breeding success varies are accentuated (Table 23.5).",11
764,"male red deer can hold harems of over thirty hinds, it is, perhaps, surprising that male success does not vary more widely.",11
765,"This is partly because only a proportion of hinds conceive in a given year and individual stags rarely hold harems throughout the whole breeding season, and partly because few stags breed successfully for four years.",11
766,"In contrast, the range of breeding success among hinds is greater than might be expected because their potential breeding lifespans are long (over 12 years) and individuals tend to be either consistently successful or consistently unsuccessful breeders.",11
767,Variation in reproductive success should be greater among males of polygynous species than among males of monogamous ones.,11
768,"One surprising result of the comparison between red deer and kittiwakes is that variation in lifetime breeding success is little greater in red deer stags than in male kittiwakes (see Table 23.5): in fact if all individuals born/hatched are included, it is slightly (though not significantly) greater in male kittiwakes.",11
769,"The comparison is an unsatisfactory one since there are important differences in the life histories of the two species: male kittiwakes can breed for many more seasons, adult mortality is not so strongly age-dependent and females can fledge three young per year (see Coulson, 1966, 1968; Coulson & Wooller, 1976; Wooller & Coulson, 1977).",11
770,"However, this example serves to emphasize how misleading it can be to assume that the breeding sex ratio necessarily reflects the extent to which male reproductive success varies for, even among closely related species, it is likely to be the case that males have substantially longer breeding lifespans in monogamous species than in polygynous ones (see Wiley, 1974; Clutton-Brock .,",11
771,1982).,11
772,Direct competition for mates will be more intense among males of polygynous species than among males of monogamous ones.,11
773,"Fights between males can be common and dangerous in polygynous species (see Geist, 1971).",11
774,"However, competition between males can also be intense in monogamous species (Lack, 1954; Kleiman, 1977) and data are not yet available which would permit a meaningful comparison between the two groups of species.",11
775,"In fact, it is unsafe to assume that the intensity of direct competition  between males should necessarily be reduced in monogamous species.",11
776,"Though variation in male success may be caused principally by differences in mate or territory quality (whereas, in polygynous species, differences in mate number are the main cause of differences in success: Bateman, 1948; Wade, 1979; Clutton-Brock .,",11
777,"1982), monogamous males might be expected to compete as intensely for the best mates or territories as do polygynous males for the biggest harems.",11
778,"Where this is not the case, it may be because males cannot identify the breeding potential of young females or because female choice pre-empts male competition because variation in success is slight among males.",11
779,Sexual dimorphism will be most developed among strongly polygynous species and least developed among monogamous ones.,11
780,In many different groups of animals there is an association between polygyny and sexual dimorphism and Darwin himself was well aware of the relationship.,11
781,"More recently, a variety of studies have demonstrated statistical relationships between the degree of polygyny and the development of sexual dimorphism, though the relationship is not always a close one (Ralls, 1977).",11
782,"Compared to monogamous species, polygynous ones usually show greater sexual dimorphism in body size (Clutton-Brock, Harvey & Rudder, 1977; Shine, 1979; Alexander .,",11
783,"1979) while weapons used in intraspecific combat, the canines of primates and the antlers of deer, are also more developed in the males of polygynous species (Harvey, Kavanagh & Clutton-Brock, 1978; Clutton-Brock, Albon & Harvey, 1980).",11
784,"However, there are many exceptions (Ralls, 1977).",11
785,"In some groups of animals, the relationship between the extent of polygyny and the degree of sexual dimorphism is not a close one (Clutton-Brock .,",11
786,1977).,11
787,", some polygynous species, like Burchell's zebra (), show little or no size dimorphism while others, like the spotted hyena () and the Weddell seal (), even show reversed dimorphism (Klingel, 1972; Kruuk, 1972; Stirling, 1969).",11
788,"While it is possible that some of these exceptions result from the differing energetic requirements of males and females and attendant selection pressures affecting the relative size of the two sexes (Selander, 1972; Downhower, 1976), the common association between sex differences in size and the development of male weaponry suggests that selection pressures associated with breeding competition are frequently involved.",11
789,"To interpret exceptions to the general rule that sexual dimorphism increases with the degree of polygyny, we need to remember that it is the comparative effects of phenotypic traits on reproductive success in males and females that will determine the degree of dimorphism and not the amount of variation in reproductive success (see Price, 1970; Lande, 1980).",11
790,", while sexual dimorphism in size is likely to evolve where variation in male success is greater than female success and a given increment in body size has the same effect on breeding success in both sexes, it will also evolve if variation in reproductive success is similar in both sexes but size has a greater influence on success in males or variation in success is greater in females but the effects of size are greater among males.",11
791,"Conversely, sexual dimorphism in size is unlikely to evolve in circumstances where variation in reproductive success is greater among males but the effects of size on reproductive success are slight in both sexes.",11
792,"In the simplest of all possible worlds sexual dimorphism should, perhaps, be predicted by the relative slope of lifetime reproductive success on body size in males and females.",11
793,"However, there is no reason to suppose that relationships between size and reproductive success will be linear or that they will follow a similar pattern in both sexes.",11
794,"Indeed, where size differences are heritable and stabilizing selection is operating, there is every reason to suppose that relationships between size and reproductive success will be linear.",11
795,", even a knowledge of the relationship between body size and lifetime reproductive success in the two sexes will not answer whether the association occurs for reasons connected with breeding competition or because the two sexes differ in their energy requirements (see Downhower, 1976).",11
796,"To sort out these questions, it will be necessary to identify the particular episodes of selection during which size influences breeding success in males and females (see Arnold & Wade, 1983).",11
797,This argument raises the question of why it is that sexual dimorphism and polygyny are related .,11
798,The most likely explanation is that the factors determining breeding success in males and females tend to be most similar in monogamous species and most different in highly polygynous ones.,11
799,The factors affecting breeding success in males and females certainly differ widely in polygynous species.,11
800,", in red deer, longevity, offspring survival and home range quality have a greater effect on the reproductive success of hinds than on that of stags.",11
801,"In contrast, fighting ability, body size and (its effect on adult size) early growth have  a more important effect on the reproductive success of stags than hinds (Clutton-Brock .,",11
802,1982).,11
803,The factors affecting lifetime success in males and females of monogamous species have yet to be described.,11
804,"While it is clear that they will not be identical (see McGregor .,",11
805,"1981), it is reasonable to suppose that, especially among species that pair for life, they are likely to be more similar than in polygynous species.",11
806,Selection pressures on males and females,11
807,Emphasis on the importance of understanding the factors affecting breeding success in males and females has the advantage that it forces us to ask specific comparative questions concerning the functional significance of particular sex differences.,11
808,", does body size have a less important effect on the reproductive success of male zebras than male bovids because zebras fight with their teeth and hooves by pushing?",11
809,"Similarly, does size have a greater effect on reproductive success in female Weddell seals compared to land or pack-ice breeding species because they breed on fast ice and defend access to water holes?",11
810,"Conversely, is body size less important in male Weddells compared to other species because they defend underwater territories where success depends on manoeuvrability and because females are widely dispersed?",11
811,Thinking in these terms may help us to understand the distribution of many other sex differences.,11
812,", among hermaphroditic reef fish, some species begin life as females and a proportion of individuals later become males (protogyny)(Warner, Robertson & Leigh, 1975; Robertson & Hoffman, 1977).",11
813,"But in a few species, the clown fishes (), individuals start life as males and a proportion later become females (protandry)(Fricke & Fricke, 1977).",11
814,"The females of most protogynous species spawn on the edge of the reef, releasing their eggs into the plankton, and seldom compete for spawning sites.",11
815,"In contrast, female clownfish lay their eggs around sea anemones which they subsequently help to defend.",11
816,Does resource defence by females again increase the benefits of large body size to female clownfish while reducing the benefits of size to males as a consequence of female dispersion?,11
817,Understanding the comparative effects of size may even help to explain variation in birth sex ratios.,11
818,"It has been suggested that in species where reproductive success varies more widely among males than females and is influenced by parental investment, parents who can afford to invest heavily in their offspring should produce sons while those that cannot do so should tend to produce daughters (Trivers & Willard, 1973).",11
819,"In apparent  contradiction to the theory, dominant female baboons and macaques produce more daughters than sons while subordinates produce more sons than daughters (Altmann, 1980; Simpson & Simpson, 1982).",11
820,"One possible explanation is that reproductive success probably varies more widely among males in these species, maternal rank has a stronger on the success of daughters since females remain in their mother's troop and inherit her rank while sons disperse to other groups and may be unable to benefit substantially from their mother's rank (Altmann, 1980).",11
821,"Perhaps most importantly, emphasis on examining the effects of particular traits on the breeding success of males and females should encourage us to investigate the adaptive significance of sex differences whose functions are not immediately obvious.",11
822,", in many mammals growing males lay down less body fat than females (Glucksman, 1974) and suffer heavier mortality during periods of food shortage as a consequence (Clutton-Brock .,",11
823,1982).,11
824,"One possible explanation is that because early growth exerts a greater effect on reproductive success in males than females (see above), selection favours increased investment by young males in growth at the expense of laying down body fat to assure survival during periods of food shortage.",11
825,This prompts the question whether young lay down less fat in species showing reversed size dimorphism.,11
826,"Recent research shows that this is the case in one species belonging to this category (the European sparrow hawk: I. Newton, personal communication).",11
827,"These explanations are cautiously worded — and necessarily so, for our current knowledge of the factors affecting reproductive success in males and females is rudimentary.",11
828,"Nevertheless, the way ahead is clear.",11
829,"If we wish to fulfil Charles Darwin's ambition of understanding the reasons for the distribution of differences between the sexes, we shall need to examine the causes of variation in lifetime breeding success among males and females in natural populations.",11
830,RULES FOR CHANGING THE RULES PATRICK BATESON,11
831,Few biologists have not at one time or another marvelled at the exquisite fit that can be found between the characteristics of an organism and the characteristics of its environment.,11
832,Darwin was not the first to marvel but he made the notion of such adaptedness scientifically respectable by providing an explanation of how it might have come about.,11
833,"Nowadays, most discussion about adaptation assumes that when it is found, a fit between organism and environment is the result of evolutionary selection pressures and nothing else (e.g. Lewontin, 1978).",11
834,"Furthermore, each adaptation is supposedly transmitted from one generation to the next by genetic means alone.",11
835,"However, these assumptions are manifestly false when applied to behaviour — particularly the behaviour of complex animals (e.g. Lorenz, 1965; Hinde, 1968).",11
836,Quite obviously a great many animals are able to tune their behaviour to their environments by learning and by other developmental mechanisms which rely on external triggering.,11
837,"When faced with an example of adaptedness in behaviour, three explanations can be offered for the process of adaptation.",11
838,"Consider an actual case, the way in which a long-tailed tit makes a strong, cryptic and well-insulated place in which to lay eggs.",11
839,"Once a site in a bush or tree has been selected, the pair of long-ta fled tits search for moss and bring it back to the site.",11
840,"When some moss has stuck, each tit collects spiders' webs and stretches them across the moss.",11
841,More moss is collected and then more spiders' webs until a platform has been formed.,11
842,The bird that is building can now place moss and webs around itself — building up the sides of the nest.,11
843,When the nest-cup is well formed the bird fetches lichen and weaves this the the nest.,11
844,Building up the sides of the nest is resumed but is periodically interrupted  more lichen can be added to the outside.,11
845,"Eventually, the bird builds the walls up and over itself to form a dome, but leaves a neat entrance hole at the side.",11
846,"Finally, the nest is lined with a large number of feathers (Tinbergen, 1953, cited in Thorpe, 1956).",11
847,"In principle, the behaviour of the tits could be adapted to the job of building a safe, warm nest for offspring in three separate ways.",11
848,"First, birds performing the appropriate actions could have had more surviving offspring than those making less good nests; consequently, in the course of time, genes necessary for the expression of the appropriate actions spread through the long-tailed tit population.",11
849,"Secondly, the bird could copy what another more experienced bird had done; the process of selecting the actions best adapted to the environment had gone on in previous generations and been transmitted socially.",11
850,"Thirdly, by experimenting on its own with different materials and different actions, each bird could assemble the appropriate repertoire for building nests.",11
851,The three processes of adaptation and the three sources of adaptedness for an individual are shown in Table 24.1.,11
852,All three processes could contribute to the adaptedness of the nest-building.,11
853,We should not expect three classes of behaviour corresponding to the three processes of adaptation.,11
854,"Furthermore, we should not be surprised by the extent of learning and imitation that can be found, particularly in complex animals.",11
855,"Cultural transmission of adapted behaviour is confined to humans (see Galef, 1976; Bonner, 1980).",11
856,"One of the first examples to be discovered in animals was the opening of milk bottles in Britain by great tits, blue tits and coal tits.",11
857,"The spread of the habit from a few scattered locations before 1930 to a great many in 1947 was well documented (Fisher & Hinde, 1949; Hinde & Fisher, 1951).",11
858,The animal which is learning does not operate like an idiot photographer   attempting to take a snap of everything.,11
859,What an animal learns is highly selective and highly ordered.,11
860,The instruments for changing behaviour show an adapted regularity which suggests that they themselves have been natural selection during the course of evolution.,11
861,"With precisely this point in mind, Konrad Lorenz (1965) referred to the ‘innate school marm’ who, he imagined, was busy directing the course of learning.",11
862,"It is worth noting that what Lorenz meant by the memorable phrase was not that there were unlearned instructions for learning, but the instructions were adapted for their present use by natural selection.",11
863,The importance of this distinction will become apparent later.,11
864,"It is more usual nowadays to use computer metaphors and refer to the programming of learning (e.g. Pulliam & Dunford, 1980).",11
865,I mildly distrust such metaphors.,11
866,It can be easily assumed that because we know how computers work we therefore know how learning is programmed.,11
867,My distrust turns into hostility when phrases like ‘genetically programmed’ are used instead.,11
868,"Such phrases confuse the way in which coded information is transmitted from one generation to another with the regularities of a nervous system, which itself is the outcome of an ordered developmental process.",11
869,"For these reasons I prefer to use the phrase ‘rules for changing the rules’(Bateson, 1976).",11
870,A necessary preliminary is to clarify the meaning of the term ‘rule’.,11
871,Behaviour is very far from being disorderly.,11
872,It may be complex but it is certainly not chaotic.,11
873,Something provides direction and keeps it in order.,11
874,Something is responsible for the regularity.,11
875,‘Rules’ refer to these consistencies of behaviour.,11
876,"In more complex animals, consistencies are not easily found on the surface and many of us feel the need to postulate structural regularity beneath the surface if we are to make sense of what we see.",11
877,A famous example of this theoretical approach is Chomsky's (1965) analysis of language underlying grammatical rules.,11
878,"Not everybody likes this style and, among psychologists, Skinner (1959) has derided the use of concepts based on inferred structures and processes.",11
879,"It must be admitted that concepts referring to unseen processes tend to acquire additional meanings that are not suggested by the evidence they are intended to explain (see MacCorquodale & Meehl, 1948).",11
880,Muddle ensues when the rules are treated they are tangible and can be observed directly.,11
881,"But the confusion can be avoided if we treat unseen high-order rules for what they are, namely, as explanatory devices.",11
882,When that is done the thinking can be creative and rewarding.,11
883,The usage of ‘rule’ by biologists is clearly different from that employed by social scientists when they talk about verbally transmitted instructions for what humans may  and may not do.,11
884,It would obviously avoid punning and confusion if different terms were used.,11
885,"However, it is unlikely that biologists will be misunderstood when they apply the term to animals.",11
886,In this chapter I first consider the underlying rules for associative learning and suggest that some useful general principles have already been uncovered.,11
887,"I go on to argue that, despite the underlying regularities, the behaviour of an individual animal is only predictable when a lot is known about the conditions in which the animal has grown up.",11
888,"to emphasize the importance of this point, I devote the rest of the chapter to a discussion of the developmental rules that may influence mate choice in humans.",11
889,A growing understanding of such rules has tempted biologists into making exaggerated claims about the invariance of human mating preferences and also about the origins of incest taboos.,11
890,"I argue that only one process were involved, the outcome would depend on conditions and, since conditions vary, so must the behavioural outcome.",11
891,"For all that, I conclude that the postulated underlying rules for development may usefully account for of the variation in human sexual behaviour and possibly even the variation in marriage laws.",11
892,Rules for associative learning,11
893,Any animal with even a rudimentary nervous system will be better placed if it can compute the arrival of impending danger or the location of valuable resources food or mates.,11
894,Its nervous system does not have to be modifiable to work with reasonable efficiency in this way.,11
895,", the power to predict and control the environment is enormously enhanced by a capacity to associate neutral events with those that already have some importance for the animal.",11
896,"With such capacity, initially meaningless cues and initially haphazard or exploratory acts can acquire causal significance.",11
897,What could be the rules for the necessary associative learning processes?,11
898,One very obvious possibility would be a time-window preceding the important event.,11
899,If a neutral event occurs within this time-window then it loses its neutrality.,11
900,"To give a text-book example, college students were trained in a situation in which a buzzer was sounded before, after or together with the delivery of a mild electric shock to the finger (Spooner & Kellogg, 1947).",11
901,"Periodically, the students' responses to the buzz alone were tested.",11
902,"The students who, in the training trials, heard the buzz half a second before the shock, jerked their finger back more consistently than those who had had a longer gap between the buzz and the shock during training, and they did so much more  markedly than those who heard the buzz at the time of the shock or after it (see Fig. 24.1).",11
903,The brief interval allowed for the establishment of a link between neutral and significant events was at one time elevated into a general law of associative learning.,11
904,"Equipped with this rule and with knowledge of what are important events, the animal seems to be well set up to acquire the ability to use initially meaningless environmental cues as predictors of what will happen, and initially haphazard acts as instruments for controlling the environment.",11
905,"While it might seem to make good intuitive sense that a time-window should be small, substantial delay in detectable effect can sometimes follow the performance of an activity.",11
906,"If you eat some contaminated food, you will not necessarily feel the ill-effects immediately.",11
907,"Indeed, it is well known now that many mammals and birds can develop aversions to novel foods that were followed by ill-effects hours after ingestion (reviewed by Domjan, 1980).",11
908,Experiments involve a spurious association between the novel food and the illness which is usually induced chemically or by X-rays.,11
909,"Nevertheless, the animals subsequently avoid the novel food.",11
910,"They do not avoid familiar food which has similarly been followed by illness, and only certain cues smells and tastes associated with the novel food are attended to.",11
911,"Others, noise, are treated as being irrelevant (see Revusky, 1971; LoLordo, 1979).",11
912,The implication is that the   animal is able to classify neutral events learning and has a rule for what classes are relevant to particular outcomes.,11
913,The phenomenon of modifiable taste aversion is often taken as one of the prime pieces of evidence for doubting general principles of associative learning.,11
914,"It has led some people to argue that the only sensible way to study learning is by examining it in the ecological conditions to which it is adapted (Johnston, 1981).",11
915,"However, common features can be found, whether a rat is learning to avoid poison or shock.",11
916,"If two neutral events of the same class are used, the second one interferes with learning about the first.",11
917,", rats were given novel saccharin solution and 1 5 min later were given novel vinegar solution, and finally they were made ill with lithium chloride.",11
918,"Subsequently, they were much less likely to avoid the saccharin solution than rats which had been given water vinegar (Revusky, 1971).",11
919,The vinegar had over-shadowed the saccharin.,11
920,"The time-window idea probably has to be retained in a watered-down form because if an animal is given novel food followed by weeks of familiar food and finally made sick, it is unlikely that it will avoid novel food.",11
921,"Nonetheless, the notion of a time-window is not sufficient to account for what is found.",11
922,The rule would seem to need a triple condition attached to it.,11
923,"a neutral event has occurred within a certain time of an already important event, if it was of a certain category and another of the same category had not been interposed between it and the important event,that event itself acquires significance for the animal.",11
924,At this point it would be fair to ask: what has all the work on the avoidance of shock and poisons got to do with social behaviour?,11
925,The answer is that associative aspects of learning enable the individual to cope not only with its physical environment but also with its social environment.,11
926,"Humphrey (1976) has argued convincingly that animals are in many ways over-equipped for the inanimate environment, but the environment provided by other animals (particularly clever ones) is especially complex, difficult to predict and difficult to control.",11
927,"Predators and prey have to be coped with one way or the other, but strong pressures also come from social companions.",11
928,Social groups are clearly not just bands of competitors and individuals often need for survival.,11
929,"Nevertheless, group members also have to compete with for many necessary resources.",11
930,"In such competitions, it is not simply the one who is strongest who wins.",11
931,It can frequently be the one with the best abilities to make complex calculations about what the others are .,11
932,"predicting and controlling the social environment, high technology can quite clearly be every bit as important as brute force.",11
933,"It follows that in complex animals , the rules for learning the rules can be as much to do with social interaction as anything else.",11
934,Development of rules,11
935,"If we are right in our inferences about the rules for associative learning, they clearly do seem to have adapted qualities.",11
936,"They fit the animal's information-gathering equipment to particular problems and, presumably, they have been natural selection during evolution.",11
937,"Therefore, they must be transmitted in some way, usually genetically, from one generation to the next.",11
938,"At this point, though, we should not forget the hard-learned lesson that an evolutionary argument is not the same as a developmental one.",11
939,The rules for modifying behaviour do not spring fully armed the genome.,11
940,"They themselves have to develop and, clearly, they represent the workings of an already functional nervous system and body.",11
941,The extent to which their development involves various kinds of experience raises an entirely separate issue.,11
942,"As a matter of fact we know that, in complicated animals, many features of the rules are profoundly modified by experience.",11
943,I discovered this painfully myself when I went as a visitor to a beautifully equipped laboratory to work on learning in rhesus monkeys.,11
944,The laboratory had some elegant computer-controlled apparatus for teaching the monkeys to discriminate between visual forms letters.,11
945,If the monkey pressed the correct letter it was rewarded with a peanut by a mechanical dispenser which was specially designed for this kind of food.,11
946,"Everything was perfect when I came to train experimentally naive monkeys, I discovered that they did not like peanuts.",11
947,"The monkeys had to be deprived of their regular food and accustomed to the peanuts for weeks before they would take them with any readiness, treat the nuts as rewards for appropriate behaviour.",11
948,"In this case, which is not exceptional (see Weiskrantz & Cowey, 1963), experience expanded what the monkeys regarded as acceptable food, and at an earlier stage in development experience had narrowed the range.",11
949,"It could be argued that in such instances an unlearnt program could still be detected at work behind the scenes since the general category of food, and its effectiveness as a reward, was in some sense built in.",11
950,"In other cases though, it becomes more difficult to pinpoint what might or might not act as a reward without very extensive knowledge of the animal's previous experience.",11
951,", the conditions in which it becomes possible for an animal to perform an act that would bring it food become rewarding themselves.",11
952,So the animal will work to provide itself with those conditions.,11
953,"In this way lengthy chains of behaviour can be developed with any one event providing the terminating condition for one action and the enabling condition for the next (see Kelleher, 1966).",11
954,This is the basis for many complex circus acts performed by animals.,11
955,"Beyond this, the knowledge of the ways in which initially neutral cues are treated as potentially relevant or ignored is growing, and suggests that the rules for learning can be influenced by the nature of prior experience (e.g. Dickinson, 1980).",11
956,"Presumably, if the rules for learning are to have any universality in natural conditions, the experience which affects them must be a common feature of all the animals having the rules — in other words, the variance the environment is normally small in the environment to which the animal is adapted.",11
957,"Also, when considering development, it must be stressed that we do not have to depend on an infinite regress.",11
958,Quite clearly learning does not have to be involved in the development of the rules for learning.,11
959,", even very young rats selectively associate taste with poison and texture with electric shock (Gemberling, Domjan & Amsel, 1980; Domjan, 1980).",11
960,"So, in this case, it looks the rules for forming some associations, but not others, are not dependent on learning for their development.",11
961,But that should not make anybody complacent about the developmental processes.,11
962,"The classic mistake has been to confuse experiences involved in learning with all other kinds of experience which the animal can have during its development (see Lehrman, 1970).",11
963,"All sorts of environmental conditions can have non-specific but profound influences on behavioural development without involving learning (see Bateson, 1981).",11
964,Change the social or physical conditions in which the animal is growing up and you may find it ends up with a different set of rules for learning.,11
965,"It will seem obvious, I hope, that a rule for learning or for any other kind of developmental process, is not a gene written large.",11
966,We have no reason to suppose that there is any simple correspondence between gene and rule for changing behaviour any more than there is an isomorphic relationship between gene and behaviour.,11
967,So why make an issue it?,11
968,The reason is that some of the influential popularizers of modern evolutionary theory still manage to confuse the developmental issue with the evolutionary one.,11
969,"Because gene frequencies are generally presumed to change in phylogeny, then it is suggested that genes must be doing the work in ontogeny.",11
970,"As a result of this category mistake, total non-communication has occurred between the sociobiologists and their critics (see Bateson, 1982b).",11
971,"The distinct issues are relatively easy to sort out in  the case of associative learning but, as will become apparent in the remainder of this chapter, they are all too easily muddled when functional approaches are brought to bear on development problems.",11
972,A functional approach to morality,11
973,"I am going to consider now a famous case in which the supposed regularities of human morality are attributed to the workings of adaptive rules, so providing an evolutionary explanation for part of human culture.",11
974,"The evolutionary costs in this case are those inbreeding, and the cultural outcome is the incest taboo.",11
975,Two quite distinct arguments are mounted.,11
976,"Since these are sometimes confusingly conflated, it is helpful to keep them separate they are not mutually exclusive (see Fig. 24.2).",11
977,The first argument is the classical one and runs as follows.,11
978,"Human beings, being observant and intelligent, spot the consequences of matings between close relatives and make safety laws about them.",11
979,The incest taboo is equivalent to a legal requirement to wear seat belts or crash helmets.,11
980,"It is sometimes claimed that people in many cultures are aware of the ill-effects of inbreeding (Lindzey, 1967), but nobody, as far as I know, has claimed that such knowledge is universal.",11
981,"Certainly in modern statistical studies, differences between children of inbred and outbred marriages can be scarcely detectable, particularly when the inbred marriages occur in communities where spouses are traditionally first-cousins (e.g. Rao & Inbaraj, 1977).",11
982,Even in outbred communities it would be very difficult to detect inbreeding costs when infant mortality was high and its causes and those of deformities in offspring were numerous and varied.,11
983,The second argument about the origins of the incest taboo is the one that relates to the major theme of this chapter and I shall consider it at some length.,11
984,"I should emphasize first, that the two possibilities shown in Fig. 24.2 are not the only explanations for the origins of the incest taboo.",11
985,"Most anthropologists would prefer to look elsewhere, partly I suspect the way the biological arguments have been overstated.",11
986,"The biological part of the second argument shown in Fig. 24.2 is well-trodden ground and has been reviewed in numerous places recently (e.g. Alexander, 1980; Fox, 1980; Thiessen & Gregg, 1980; Bixler, 1981).",11
987,Westermarck (1891) believed that satisfying sexual relationships are not formed between people who have spent their childhood together.,11
988,"This view is supported by the behaviour of members of Israeli kibbutzim who very rarely marry the people they have grown up with (Spiro, 1958; Talmon, 1964; Shepher, 1971).",11
989,"Other evidence the Westermarck  hypothesis comes from the work of Wolf and his colleagues, summarized in a recent book (Wolf & Huang, 1980).",11
990,They have analysed a form of arranged marriage which was practised in Taiwan.,11
991,The wife-to-be was adopted into the family of the husband-to-be when she was a young girl.,11
992,The marriage was formalized and consummated when the partners were adolescent.,11
993,"This form of arranged marriage, the ‘minor marriage’, could be compared with a more common form of arranged marriage, the ‘major marriage’, in which the partners met for the first time when they were adolescents.",11
994,In a great many respects the minor marriages were less successful than the major marriages.,11
995,"They generated fewer children, the rates of infidelity were higher, .",11
996,", 15% of the 1117 minor marriages ended in divorce whereas only 6% of the 1651 major marriages did so.",11
997,"On a note of caution, it should be pointed out that the people involved in minor marriages were considerably younger at the time of the formalization of the marriage than those involved in the major marriages.",11
998,"Also a minor marriage was a much cheaper option for the parents than a major marriage and was, therefore, considered to be socially disgraceful.",11
999,These factors may have contributed markedly to the relative lack of success of the minor marriages.,11
1000,"Another independent piece of evidence corroborating the Westermarck   hypothesis is provided by stable incestuous relationships (Weinberg, 1956).",11
1001,"Weinberg found that whereas most incestuous relationships were unstable and short-lived, six that he examined involved strong and lasting attachments between the partners.",11
1002,In each case the siblings concerned had been separated from when they were babies.,11
1003,Three criticisms are commonly directed at the evidence for the Westermarck hypothesis.,11
1004,"First, it is pointed out that a most preferred sexual partner is not necessarily a spouse (e.g. Solomon, 1978); however, it is difficult to see how this perfectly valid point is relevant to the evidence given above.",11
1005,"Secondly, overt sexuality is found between siblings (Finkelhor, 1980) and among kibbutz members of the same age (Spiro, 1958; Kaffmann, 1977).",11
1006,"Finally, despite supposed indifference to familiar members of the opposite sex, incest does occur quite frequently (Livingstone, 1980).",11
1007,"I shall not ignore these criticisms, but at this point I think it is helpful to consider the data from animals.",11
1008,"strengthening the view that reduced sexual responsiveness to familiar members of the opposite sex is quite widespread in birds and mammals, the animal studies also suggest ways of dealing with criticisms of the human evidence.",11
1009,They also point to other sources of variation in mate choice.,11
1010,Imprinting and discrepancy hypothesis,11
1011,The effect of early experience on the mating preferences of birds and mammals has been known for a long time.,11
1012,The effect of imprinting on the sexual preferences of birds was made famous many years ago by Konrad Lorenz (1935).,11
1013,"Numerous quantitative studies have been done on both birds and mammals in the last twenty years (reviews in Immelmann, 1972; Bateson, 1978a) and have shown that early experience can have profound and lasting effects on sexual preferences.",11
1014,"Admittedly, imprinting was usually thought of as the process by which animals normally learn about the characteristics of their species, a reference was occasionally made to ‘asexual imprinting’(Aberle .,",11
1015,"1963) and a number of studies were done on the reduced sexual responsiveness to familiar members of the opposite sex in rodents (reviews in Dewsbury, 1982; D'Udine & Alleva, 1983).",11
1016,", though, thinking was retarded by the dichotomous classifications that were in use at the time.",11
1017,Assortative mating was either positive or negative.,11
1018,"Animals, like humans, were either endogamous or exogamous, they preferred the familiar or they preferred the novel.",11
1019,"It is possible to break the straight-jacket by applying an idea that  had been used for many years in thinking about the psychology of classification and aesthetics (McLlelland & Clark, 1933; Berlyne, 1960).",11
1020,This is known as the ‘discrepancy hypothesis’.,11
1021,", what people find most stimulating and most attractive is different but not too different from what they know already.",11
1022,"As is shown in Fig. 24.3, it was a simple step to translate this into a hypothesis about the effects of early experience on mating preferences (Bischof, 1972; Bateson, 1978a).",11
1023,"Experimental studies on both birds and mammals followed quickly (Bateson, 1978b; Gilder & Slater, 1978; McGregor & Krebs, 1982).",11
1024,"However, it was not all plain sailing.",11
1025,"When they were given a choice between a familiar and a novel member of the opposite sex, birds might actually choose the familiar the novel really did not look so very different to our eyes (Miller, 1979; Bateson, 1980; Slater & Clements, 1981).",11
1026,The results suggested that the birds might have sharply tuned preferences only slightly displaced siblings when normally reared.,11
1027,"The difficulty is that, if the most preferred mate is slightly different from a familiar member of the opposite sex and if we do not know how to measure the difference, we can unwittingly present the animal with a novel object which is less attractive than the familiar.",11
1028,It might seem the hypothesis is so slippery that it cannot be falsified.,11
1029,"Indeed, this point   has been used as a general criticism of the discrepancy hypothesis (Thomas, 1971).",11
1030,"However, the issue is settled by positive evidence not by ingenious explanation of the failure to confirm the idea.",11
1031,"If members of the opposite sex were graded along a continuum from familiar to very novel and the animals were allowed to choose between all the possibilities, then progress can be made.",11
1032,"While we do not yet know what cues the animals might use, we can exploit the likelihood that, when other qualities physical well-being are equal, an optimal choice of mate is likely to be one that minimizes the costs of both inbreeding and outbreeding (Bateson, 1980, 1983).",11
1033,"In other words, the genetic relatedness of the partner is likely to be important.",11
1034,"It is a relatively easy matter, when we know the pedigrees of animals, to arrange choices between members of the opposite sex of different degrees of relatedness.",11
1035,I have done this with Japanese quail.,11
1036,"Birds that had been reared with siblings were tested in apparatus that allowed them to be given six alternatives (Bateson, 1982a).",11
1037,"In one experiment birds were given choices between members of the opposite sex that were either familiar siblings, novel siblings, novel first-cousins, novel third-cousins, or novel unrelated individuals.",11
1038,Fig. 24.4 shows the mean percentage durations   spent each category of stimulus bird by both adult males and females.,11
1039,The time spent near novel first-cousins was significantly greater than the time spent near both the familiar and novel siblings and novel unrelated individuals.,11
1040,"Despite the clear overall preference for first-cousins, the data were highly variable.",11
1041,The variability was expected as the degree of relationship between two individuals only indicates the probability that the two share heritable characters.,11
1042,Knowledge by a bird of a sibling's appearance must necessarily be an imperfect guide to what a first-cousin will look like.,11
1043,", remaining near a member of the opposite sex is not the same as mating with it.",11
1044,"However, other experiments have shown that, in adult male Japanese quail, the time spent near a female in a choice test is strongly linked to the copulation preference (Bateson, 1978b).",11
1045,"Furthermore, the males are observed to court the females in the choice tests.",11
1046,"Finally, I had found in other experiments that birds show no consistent preferences for members of the same sex.",11
1047,The results with quail provide direct support for the discrepancy hypothesis as applied to sexual preferences and indirect support for the   notion of optimal outbreeding.,11
1048,"I have written elsewhere about the evolutionary pressures which might generate a balance between inbreeding and outbreeding (Bateson, 1983).",11
1049,"However, it is worth emphasizing here that four costs have been proposed for inbreeding, and seven for outbreeding.",11
1050,The costs of outbreeding may include the risks of infections from pathogens carried by the partner and the breaking up in the offspring of co-adapted complexes of genes found in the parents.,11
1051,"Not all costs can apply to all species and some naturally outbreeding species may use other mechanisms for avoiding the costs of inbreeding, dispersal the natal area by one sex (reviewed by Greenwood, 1980).",11
1052,"Even in those species that choose a mate that is different but not too different from close kin, other factors are also important.",11
1053,"Qualities the physical condition of the member of the opposite sex, the resources it holds and the extent to which it bears characters that have been sexual selection can all affect it is chosen (see Halliday, 1983).",11
1054,It would be quite wrong to suggest that the influence on mate choice is relative familiarity.,11
1055,"Despite the variety and the complexity, the animal work indicates first and foremost that mate choice can be profoundly influenced by early experience.",11
1056,"Secondly, in some species the choice is remarkably finely tuned under certain circumstances familiarity may be preferred over novelty.",11
1057,The fine tuning might be achieved by employing two well-known mechanisms as shown in Fig. 24.5.,11
1058,"Filial imprinting is known to restrict preferences to the familiar (see Bateson, 1979), and sexual imprinting could operate in exactly the same way.",11
1059,"Habituation, by contrast, reduces responsiveness to the familiar.",11
1060,The net effect of superimposing habituation on imprinting would be to displace the preference the familiar.,11
1061,The combination of the two learning processes could produce a sharply peaked preference for something different from the familiar when other things are equal.,11
1062,Mating preferences in humans,11
1063,The animal evidence enriches the discussion of human mating preferences in several important ways.,11
1064,"First, by emphasizing that preferences are displaced away somewhat from the familiar, it is possible to explain two facets of the data from humans that would otherwise have seemed incompatible.",11
1065,"the evidence of reduced sexual interest in familiar members of the opposite sex, which I have already mentioned, the great mass of data shows that freely chosen human spouses are more like  than would be expected on a chance basis.",11
1066,"Similarities are not only social and psychological, but also found in measures of body dimensions length of earlobe (e.g. Eckland, 1968; Lewis, 1975; Thiessen & Gregg, 1980).",11
1067,A second point is that the method of testing choices draws attention to the relative nature of a measured preference.,11
1068,It will rarely be the case that either an animal or a human will be provided with the opportunity to mate with an absolutely ideal member of the opposite sex.,11
1069,"Furthermore, the best available mating may be with a sibling or an offspring on certain occasions.",11
1070,Sexual responsiveness to a familiar member of the opposite sex may not be zero — particularly when the time allotted to searching for an alternative has run out.,11
1071,"The conclusion is, therefore, that when an individual has no choice or an impoverished set of choices, he or she may inbreed.",11
1072,"Finally, the precocious sexual behaviour, which is often observed between siblings and was the basis for Freud's (1950) thinking about the development of sexual preferences, may play a role.",11
1073,"If habituation is involved in displacing preferences the familiar to individuals that are slightly different, then the learning process may be facilitated by the performance of precocious sexual behaviour which is common enough in humans (Finkelhor, 1980) as it is in other animals.",11
1074,"I am not convinced that overt sexual behaviour is essential for the development of indifference, it may help.",11
1075,"But I think it is highly misleading to suggest, as Shepher (1971) has done, that development of sexual preferences is by the age of six in humans.",11
1076,He based this conclusion on a very few individuals who married within their peer group in the kibbutz and were found to have entered the kibbutz during their childhood and usually after the age of six.,11
1077,"To demonstrate a sensitive period of the type he was proposing, it would be necessary to show that adults who had left a kibbutz at the age of six were not sexually attracted by members of the opposite sex whom they had been reared with while still in the kibbutz.",11
1078,"As things stand, the existing evidence has been wildly over-interpreted both by Shepher and by others who have uncritically accepted his conclusions (e.g. Lumsden & Wilson, 1981; van den Berghe, 1982).",11
1079,"If we reject the naive application of the sensitive period concept and accept that familiarity of a certain kind does reduce sexual attractiveness, then it may be possible to reconcile the thinking of Freud with that of Westermarck.",11
1080,"The sexual attraction of their siblings and parents, which people under psychoanalysis reported they felt, may have created the conditions for developing subsequent indifference.",11
1081,This line of thought might also be applied rewardingly to explain one striking feature of divorce  statistics.,11
1082,", in British women who married before the age of 20, the proportion of marriages that ended in divorce has been approximately double that of the marriages of women who married between 20 and 24 (Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, 1978).",11
1083,This has been true at any time between four and 25 years after marriage.,11
1084,"Many factors, differences between social classes in attitudes to marriage, could explain or contribute to explaining the difference.",11
1085,"Clever research design could sort out some of the confounded variables, so I shall add to the possibilities a speculation arising from my point about habituation.",11
1086,Early marriages may involve a great deal of intimacy but relatively little sexual satisfaction.,11
1087,"Indeed, people often report that their early sex lives were relatively unrewarding.",11
1088,"If the effects of habituation are not powerfully offset by rewarding sexual experience, the partner may lose his or her attractiveness and become the equivalent of a sibling.",11
1089,"While a great deal is stili unknown about the development of sexual preferences in both animals and humans, the similarities are quite striking.",11
1090,In my view a good case has been made for the view that the learning processes involved in the formation of mating preference of humans have been natural selection during the course of evolution.,11
1091,"However, acceptance of this point has to be tempered by an awareness that mate choice is influenced by many qualities.",11
1092,Early experience with particular individuals is not the only source of variation in adults' mating preferences.,11
1093,"So even if Westermarck was right, as I believe he was, it would be extremely surprising if his hypothesis explained all of what humans do.",11
1094,Incest taboos and marriage laws,11
1095,"In a society in which spouses are freely chosen, it is easy to confuse the influences on sexual preference with those on marriage.",11
1096,The anthropologists have to point again and again to the great many societies in which spouses are arranged and not freely chosen.,11
1097,"A biologist who was so minded could counter by arguing that, if the marriages generate the children, then marriage laws could still have been influenced by evolutionary pressures.",11
1098,"While that argument would beg an important question, on the face of it the marriage laws do seem to promote the function of optimal outbreeding.",11
1099,"Marriage with close kin is generally forbidden in most societies and so, commonly, is marriage with people of dissimilar culture.",11
1100,"A general bias spouses who come from nearby — both spatially and socially — has often been noted by anthropologists (Fortes, 1962).",11
1101,"Charles Darwin married a cousin and, indeed, such marriages were quite  common in nineteenth-century Europe.",11
1102,"It must be said that the apparently convincing evidence has been processed into non-significance by elegant mathematical analysis (Hajnal, 1963).",11
1103,"This seems to have been done in the interests of retaining the theoreticians' assumption of panmixia (Charlesworth, 1980).",11
1104,"But maybe Darwin knew better, since the assumption of random mating could hardly apply in those numerous societies that actually first-cousin marriages (Murdock, 1967).",11
1105,Is there some functional similarity with mate choice in quail?,11
1106,Two important and unresolved problems are raised by this line of thought.,11
1107,How does an inhibition get translated into a prohibition?,11
1108,And how much of the variation in the prohibition is explained by the character of the inhibitions?,11
1109,Incest taboos take many different shapes and forms.,11
1110,They sometimes include certain types of cousin and people related by marriage only.,11
1111,"Prohibitions on sexual relations with parents, siblings or children, are nearly always universal — but not quite.",11
1112,Hopkins (1980) has analysed the marriage records of Roman Egypt in which the census data were especially complete.,11
1113,"He confirmed the view that among perfectly ordinary people, who were neither  nor priests, full brother-sister marriages occurred in a minimum of nine the 113 marriages he analysed, If the less certain cases are also included marriages between half-siblings, the proportion of incestuous marriages was of the order of 20%.",11
1114,"Whatever view one takes of the origins of the incest taboos, it would be intellectually shoddy simply to ignore these data.",11
1115,Can we find a common underlying principle that explains the variation?,11
1116,"Levi-Strauss (1969) proposed that, women being the most important resource that men have, a system for exchanging women always underlies the social control of marriage.",11
1117,"His arguments have something of the character of the Ptolemaic theory of the universe — brilliant, logical, grand, but despite all these things, extremely complex.",11
1118,"His theory is in stark contrast to the biologists' attempts to find a relationship between the prohibitions on certain types of marriage partner, and the inhibitions about having sexual contact with such classes of people.",11
1119,These ideas are simple.,11
1120,"So simple, indeed, that usually the argument is not stated .",11
1121,"The correlation between prohibition and inhibition is offered it explained everything, or , the prohibition is held to have arisen by ‘myth making’ or ‘ritualisation’(Bischof, 1972).",11
1122,"As Williams (1978) pointed out, such statements are nothing more than promissory notes.",11
1123,They do not provide an explanation of how one turns into the other.,11
1124,"In a recent book, Lumsden & Wilson (1981) attempted to deal with the issue mathematically.",11
1125,"However, their efforts have not provided the  explanation that we need.",11
1126,They merely assumed that inhibition generates the incest taboo without pointing to any behavioural mechanism that could translate one into the other.,11
1127,anything better I shall make a suggestion.,11
1128,Prohibitions may have arisen from the social pressure directed against unorthodox behaviour.,11
1129,What is normal behaviour is itself influenced by the pattern of early experiences which are common to that society.,11
1130,"The implication is, therefore, that there will be some correlation between child-rearing practices and taboos (see Fig. 24.6).",11
1131,People often strongly disapprove of others who behave in unusual ways.,11
1132,The most obvious example is the moral repugnance that many people show for homosexuality between consenting adults.,11
1133,Why should they mind?,11
1134,They are not harmed by the homosexuality.,11
1135,But the conventional response is nonetheless a violent one — in some societies homosexuality may be punished by death.,11
1136,"If fear of nonconformity and the unusual has driven the cultural evolution of incest taboos, then a comparable argument should apply to taboos on marriages with strangers or members of other castes and races.",11
1137,Levi-Strauss (1969) noted that such taboos certainly exist and a notorious modern example of it is found in the immorality laws of South Africa which forbid sexual relations between blacks and whites.,11
1138,"If this approach is anywhere near correct, we should expect a correlation between the class of people who are prohibited as sexual partners and the likelihood that they will be familiar or extremely novel (see Fig. 24.6).",11
1139,"Obviously many things might muddy the correlation between social structure and prohibited partners, but one piece of existing evidence points in the right direction.",11
1140,"While first-cousins are often favoured as marriage partners, a distinction is very often made between parallel and cross-cousins.",11
1141,The sibling parents of parallel cousins are the same sex and the sibling parents of cross-cousins are of the opposite sex.,11
1142,Sometimes parallel cousins   are forbidden as spouses and cross-cousins are favoured.,11
1143,Alexander (1980) has gone through Murdock's (1967) ethnographic atlas and found that this asymmetrical treatment of cousins is strongly associated with the type of marriage common in that culture.,11
1144,The results are shown in Table 24.2.,11
1145,"Alexander argues that because brothers may share wives in polygynous societies, parallel cousins may in fact be half-siblings.",11
1146,"He seems, therefore, to be using the evidence as an ingenious updating of the classical safety law argument.",11
1147,"However, parallel cousins who may in reality be half-siblings are also likely to have lived in the same household.",11
1148,", genetic relatedness is confounded with familiarity.",11
1149,"So, another possible explanation is that in a polygynous society, the parallel cousins will be much more likely to grow up together than the cross-cousins.",11
1150,"In effect, the parallel cousins are as familiar as siblings.",11
1151,It does not follow from the argument I have mounted here that the conformism generating prohibitions is an adaptive response that evolved in the service of maintaining optimal outbreeding.,11
1152,The conformism might have arisen for quite different reasons and among its other consequences happened incidentally to amplify the beneficial effects of the inhibitions.,11
1153,"Certainly, it would be difficult to argue that the variation in human marriage laws could be explained their evolutionary benefits.",11
1154,"The brother-sister marriages of Roman Egypt probably had a great deal to do with the preservation of property and nothing to do with the preservation of genes (Hopkins, 1980).",11
1155,"And similar explanations can account for a lot of the variation found in human societies (Goody, 1976).",11
1156,It would be absurd to adopt a rigidly determinist view of what has gone on in the formation of culturally transmitted marriage laws.,11
1157,"To say the least, it is unfortunate that a multiply influenced process with many stages in it should be thought of by sociobiological proponents and their critics alike (e.g. Solomon, 1978) as having an invariant outcome and a single explanation.",11
1158,"It is like arguing that if the hypothesis that smoking   causes lung cancer is to be believed,who smokes must get cancer; what is more else (asbestos) can be admitted as having the same effect.",11
1159,"The opposed parties in such disputes, evidently believing that causality has a chain-like character to it, have an impoverished notion of how things actually work.",11
1160,In most complex systems the sources of variation are likely to be numerous.,11
1161,It follows that alternative explanations do not have to be mutually exclusive.,11
1162,The best that can be said about marriage laws is that of the variation may be explained along the lines proposed here.,11
1163,"Even within this explanatory framework, little useful understanding will be obtained without first studying the problem at many different levels.",11
1164,"What is needed, therefore, is constructive collaboration between biologists and social scientists and a proper respect for the insights that the different disciplines can provide.",11
1165,Conclusion,11
1166,The arguments presented in this chapter do not lead to comfortable conclusions that can be instantly assimilated.,11
1167,"However, they are not, I trust, obscurantist and a positive point does emerge.",11
1168,Regularities be found in the way that behaviour is tuned to the environment during development.,11
1169,"To be effective, though, the rules have a conditional character to them which means, , that they generate variation in behaviour variable environments.",11
1170,"It is not inexplicable variation, but it is variation nonetheless.",11
1171,The old reductionist's vision was that one day when we knew enough about genes we would be able to predict every detail of every adult's behaviour.,11
1172,It always was a pipe-dream.,11
1173,Imagine civil servants working in a capital city and trying to make the decisions required for running a large country.,11
1174,They Simply would not have the flexibility or the speed of reaction to cope with the complexities of everyday life.,11
1175,"And so it is with the genes, the natural bureaucrats.",11
1176,"On their own they are too clumsy in their form of regulation to provide the necessary adaptations, especially those required for social living.",11
1177,The genes had to delegate control.,11
1178,"When we examine animals with nervous systems that were built with conditional rules for dealing with the external environment, the business of predicting how they will respond on the basis of knowing how they were made becomes impossible.",11
1179,It is like trying to predict the outcome of a game of chess before anyone has made a move.,11
1180,What we do is attempt to get hold of the rules of the game we can make sense of a game as it is played.,11
1181,At that stage I concede happily that we may be able to predict  what a clever animal will do in a particular set of circumstances.,11
1182,"In the meantime, we should expect to be surprised very often.",11
1183,SOCIOBIOLOGY AND THE DARWINIAN APPROACH TO MIND AND CULTURE EDWARD O. WILSON,11
1184,"On 3 October 1838, Charles Darwin wrote in his notebook that ‘to study Metaphysics, as they have always been studied appears to me to be like puzzling at astronomy without mechanics…",11
1185,"Experience shows that the problem of the mind cannot be solved by attacking the citadel itself…the mind is function of body…we must bring some foundation to argue from…’(in Barrett, 1980).",11
1186,"Although Darwin had turned in the right direction, he could do very little with mind and culture during his lifetime for the same reason that he was helpless before the mysteries of heredity: the basic information and modes of thought were lacking to produce the stable foundation which he correctly viewed as essential.",11
1187,"Today, one hundred years after his death, we may be approaching a sufficient understanding to bring to fruition Darwin's proposal.",11
1188,"If so, we can verify another insight, which was entered into the notebook on 16 August 1838: ‘Origin of man now proved…",11
1189,Metaphysics must flourish…,11
1190,He who understand baboon would do more toward metaphysics than Locke.’,11
1191,"What will be the outcome of this most problematic, controversial extension of evolutionary theory?",11
1192,It is a common perception that during the 1950s biology replaced physics as the most exciting domain of science.,11
1193,"I will make a brash prediction: that by the year 2000 the social sciences, brain studies, will commence to replace biology in the central role.",11
1194,"If such an advance is realized, it represents one more step in a progression in which the antidiscipline, , the field treating the next level of organization below the one under scrutiny, is partly replaced by the synthetic enterprise to which it gave rigour and impetus (Wilson, 1977).",11
1195,"In other words, biology advances the social sciences.",11
1196,"Just as physics and chemistry helped to modernize biology and moved it to centre stage  during the past thirty years, I believe that biology is about to augment the social sciences greatly and move them to centre stage.",11
1197,The principal remaining obstacle in this enterprise is the unknown relation between genes and culture.,11
1198,"But when one uses the phrase ‘an unknown relation’, he means that it is a puzzle to be solved.",11
1199,"In this case the problem is surely one of the most important in all of science, not to mention philosophy, as Darwin perceived 144 years ago.",11
1200,"A few writers still speak of a permanent discontinuity between the biological sciences and the social sciences, grounded in epistemology (Eccles, 1980) or forced by a fundamental difference in goals (Hampshire, 1978).",11
1201,"But others, principally in cognitive science and evolutionary biology, have come to see the gap as a largely unknown evolutionary process, a complicated and fascinating interaction in which culture is generated by biological process while biological traits are simultaneously altered by genetic evolution cultural innovation.",11
1202,"Charles J. Lumsden and I have recently studied this dual evolutionary process, which we call gene-culture coevolution (Lumsden & Wilson, 1981).",11
1203,"We have attempted to align a previously independent field of inquiry, cognitive and developmental psychology, with evolutionary biology and particularly sociobiology, and in so doing have constructed an ensemble of models that trace, at times clumsily and imperfectly, behavioural development from the genetic blueprint to the assembly of the nervous system to the learning process — and then back down to the alteration of gene frequencies by natural selection operating within the context of particular cultures.",11
1204,The full sequence covered by our models is referred to as the circuit of gene-culture coevolution.,11
1205,"This research is a logical extension of sociobiology, the systematic study of the biological basis of social behaviour and a growing division of evolutionary biology.",11
1206,The particular problem addressed by the theory is the following.,11
1207,We know that human social behaviour is extremely variable.,11
1208,"It is also open-ended, in the sense of being always rapid change innovation and importation.",11
1209,"Cultural evolution is often characterized as Lamarckian in quality, in other words, dependent on the transmission of acquired characters, and relatively fast; while genetic evolution is Darwinian, , dependent on changes in gene frequencies across generations, and slow.",11
1210,But exactly how are these two processes coupled?,11
1211,"The solution to the problem can be found by shifting emphasis from the terminal products, the genetic blueprint and the final cultural product, and concentrating on the developmental procedures that connect them.",11
1212,"The reason such analysis has not proceeded more vigorously in the past is that  evolutionary biologists have virtually ignored developmental psychology, now a vast field in its own right, while psychologists for their part have not appreciated the great potential of evolutionary theory for their own studies.",11
1213,The theory of gene-culture coevolution (see Fig. 26.1) proposes the following process.,11
1214,"First, human genes affect the way that the mind is formed — which stimuli we perceive, how information is processed, the kinds of memories most easily stored and recalled, the emotions they are most likely to evoke, .",11
1215,"These effects, which have been well documented in recent psychological research, are called epigenetic rules.",11
1216,"The rules are rooted in the particularities of human biology, and they affect the way culture is formed.",11
1217,", outbreeding is much more likely to occur than brother-sister incest the apparently innate rule that individuals raised closely together during the first six years of life are inhibited from full sexual intercourse at maturity.",11
1218,"Certain colour vocabularies are more likely to be adopted than others another rule: the retinal colour cones and certain interneurons within the brain encode light into four basic colours, the wavelength of light falling on the eye varies in a continuous manner.",11
1219,"The Dani of New Guinea have one of the poorest colour vocabularies in the world, in fact consisting only two terms, for ‘bright’ and ‘dark’respectively.",11
1220,Eleanor Rosch (1973) took advantage of this fact to conduct an experiment in learning propensity.,11
1221,She gave one group of male volunteers a new colour vocabulary to learn in which the terms were centred on the four basic colours.,11
1222,Another group of men received a vocabulary centred on the wavelengths at the margins of the basic colours.,11
1223,"Individuals in the first, ‘natural’ group learned the words twice as quickly and retained them longer.",11
1224,"When given a choice between the two terminologies, Dani men preferred the natural vocabulary.",11
1225,"Both of these cases, incest avoidance and the development of colour vocabularies, illustrate nicely how biological constraints in cognition, based on specific genes, can influence the formation of culture.",11
1226,Epigenetic rules have been demonstrated in virtually every category of cognition and behaviour investigated in such a way as to distinguish choices among stimuli.,11
1227,"Examples include odour and taste discrimination, with important effects on the evolution of language and cuisine; preference from infancy onward for certain basic geometric designs over others; phoneme formation; rules of transformational grammar; the development of particular, species-wide facial expressions to denote the emotions of fear, loathing, anger, surprise, and happiness; various other forms of nonverbal communication; the pattern of mother-infant bonding; the method of  infant holding by women; fear of strangers (a usually strong response that persists from about six to eighteen months); phobias; and others (see the review by Lumsden & Wilson, 1981).",11
1228,"It is clear that during the past twenty years developmental psychologists have come to the edge of a vast array of structural processes in the development of the mind, and an exciting era of experimental research has begun.",11
1229,Most of the ontogenetic patterns occur early enough in life and are sufficiently strongly marked and stereotyped to suggest that they are genetically canalized.,11
1230,"It is further true that some degree of heritability has been indicated by twin and pedigree analysis, of varying degrees of sophistication and reliability, in virtually every measurable category of cognitive ability and personality trait thus far studied.",11
1231,"Many of these properties form components of the epigenetic rules just cited (Ehrman & Parsons, 1981).",11
1232,"By 1980 about 3100 human genes had been distinguished, mostly by biochemical techniques.",11
1233,"Of these, 340 were pinpointed to a particular chromosome, with one on each of the 23 pairs of chromosomes (McKusick, 1980).",11
1234,Some of the genes and chromosome aberrations affect behaviour in selective ways.,11
1235,"A notable example is the major gene recently identified that reduces spatial ability in three standard tests but not in twelve others (Ashton, Polovina & Vandenberg, 1979).",11
1236,"It is equally significant that the analysis of complex, multiple-locus systems (polygenes) is well advanced.",11
1237,"Recent advances include the calculation of the numbers of chromosomal loci and genes involved in such relatively complicated behaviours as dominance and drug aversive behaviour in mice and the epigenetic rules of colour preference in birds (Thompson & Thoday, 1979).",11
1238,"An important principle of gene — culture coevolutionary theory is that a mind, open to all choices equally and hence totally dependent on the accidents of history, must still have a biological foundation — and a very finely adjusted one at that.",11
1239,The sensory apparatus and brain have to be tuned precisely to process all stimuli without bias.,11
1240,"Such an effect, which Lumsden and I have called the ‘pure cultural transmission’ of culture, cannot be achieved merely by removing genetic constraints on cognition and learning.",11
1241,"Quite the contrary: it requires a formidable array of homeostatic devices, to achieve uniform information processing and hence independence from all but the most generalized set of internal reinforcement mechanisms.",11
1242,And indeed there is no evidence that the human brain works in such an extreme behaviourist manner.,11
1243,"Nor does the grain mediate a ‘pure genetic transmission’ of culture, in which (like the song of the white-crowned sparrow) only a single form of behaviour can be taught and learned.",11
1244,"All of the evidence from cognitive studies thus  far indicates that human behaviour lies these two extremes, , in the category we have termed ‘gene-culture transmission’ of culture.",11
1245,"Multiple choices are learned and any one of them can be followed — example incest versus outbreeding — but there is an innate predisposition to learn certain ones in preference to others, or else to choose them once they have been acquired.",11
1246,Let us now review the essential steps in the proposed coevolutionary circuit.,11
1247,"Consider the case of the avoidance of brother-sister incest, which is based to a substantial degree on an inhibition developed during close domestic association in the first six years of life.",11
1248,"Because this epigenetic rule occurs across cultures and is strong enough to defeat countervailing social pressures, it can reasonably be supposed to have a genetic basis.",11
1249,"Moreover, those who follow the rule benefit in natural selection.",11
1250,"Incest results in higher rates of homozygosity, the more frequent expression of lethal or subvital recessive genes, and hence a greater incidence of hereditary disease and early death among the offspring.",11
1251,The epigenetic rule thus directs the developing mind to avoid brother-sister incest.,11
1252,"The summed preference of members of the society lead to particular cultural patterns, including reinforcing taboos and laws, that prohibit incest.",11
1253,"However, because the cultural transmission is of the intermediate, ‘gene-culture’ form, the preference is not absolute, and scattered individuals in many societies still prefer and may even practise brother-sister incest.",11
1254,The result is some variation among cultures in the frequency of its members who adopt this preference.,11
1255,"Consider, , groups of 25 individuals.",11
1256,"This is the size of many hunter-gatherer bands, the social organization in which mankind has existed throughout most of its history.",11
1257,At any given moment most such bands can be expected to contain no incestuous members.,11
1258,"A smaller percentage of the bands will contain one such member, a still smaller percentage will contain two incestuous individuals, .",11
1259,"The full array of such fractions, comprising a frequency distribution across all cultures sampled, is called an ethnographic curve.",11
1260,"We have devised methods for predicting such curves from a knowledge of two functions: the magnitude of bias in the preference for one cultural choice (incest) versus another (outbreeding), and the degree to which the expressed preference of the remainder of the group affects the magnitude of the individual bias.",11
1261,Two results of general interest emerge from this preliminary analysis.,11
1262,"First, it is technically possible to predict patterns of cultural diversity, expressed as the ethnographic curves, from a knowledge of individual cognitive development, and also to perform the reverse: to infer some of the principal properties of cognitive development from a knowledge of the pattern of cultural diversity.",11
1263,The second result of broad interest is that cultural diversity is to be expected the underlying cognitive development is rigidly programmed.,11
1264,"Cultural anthropologists have commonly argued that the existence of substantial differences among cultures is evidence of the absence of underlying biological influence (Sahlins, 1976; Harris, 1981).",11
1265,But this conclusion is entirely wrong.,11
1266,Cultural diversity is evidence neither for nor against such control.,11
1267,"Rather, what matters is the of the diversity.",11
1268,"As biological bias is increased toward one choice another in the course of genetic evolution, the mode of the ethnographic curve can be expected to shift in that direction.",11
1269,And as the influence of peer activity is increased -this influence itself may well be biologically determined — there will be a tendency for the ethnographic curve to change from a unimodal to a multimodal form.,11
1270,"By examining the pattern of cultural diversity in an explicit form the ethnographic curve, the nature of the underlying epigenetic rules can be partially inferred.",11
1271,A recurrent working hypothesis of gene-culture coevolutionary theory is that the epigenetic rules are shaped by natural selection over many generations.,11
1272,"Returning to the brother-sister incest case for illustration, we note that individuals who conform to the aversion leave more offspring.",11
1273,"As a result, genes underwriting the avoidance of incest remain at a high level in the population.",11
1274,Consequently the predisposition is sustained as one of the epigenetic rules.,11
1275,", the rules leading to higher rates of survival and reproduction tend to increase in the population.",11
1276,"Thus the assembly rules of the mind build up during evolution, element by element.",11
1277,"In the genetic models, the brain, in which the mind is created solely by the circumstances of history, proves to be a very improbable outcome in the evolution of any conceivable intelligent species.",11
1278,a species somehow managed to begin with such a brain it would soon evolve in the direction of structural and biased epigenetic rules.,11
1279,"And as the evolution proceeds, small changes in the degree of bias can be expected to result commonly in much greater changes in the final cultural product.",11
1280,", a barely detectable innate bias toward the use of body adornment, if combined with a moderate sensitivity to peer usage, would result in most or all members using such adornment in all societies.",11
1281,"Finally, a detectable amount of genetic evolution in the brain and mind can occur within only thirty or forty generations, or very roughly a thousand years.",11
1282,"If correct, this still purely theoretical conclusion implies that epigenetic rules and mental traits might have continued to evolve into  historical times.",11
1283,"The conventional view, that such biological evolution ceased tens of thousands of years ago and human change has consisted entirely of cultural evolution since then, may be incorrect.",11
1284,"In closing, I want to take note of the familiar lament that science and technology have created not just a cornucopia but terrible dangers .",11
1285,What is meant by science in this case is the physical sciences and to a lesser degree the biological sciences.,11
1286,"But the solution is not, as a few modern Luddites have suggested, the curtailment of science itself, including sociobiology and the social sciences.",11
1287,Quite the opposite: the solution is to make every effort to extend new scientific procedures into the deeper reaches of human nature to provide solutions to those residual problems that continue to defy simple economic and technological solution.,11
1288,"The peculiar clockwork of the human mind, not scientific knowledge itself, is the source of the danger.",11
1289,"If evolutionary theory can be successfully extended to the assembly of the mind and the creation of cultural diversity, the result may well rank as the completion of the Darwinian revolution.",11
1290,"Whether the particular scheme summarized here can contribute substantially to that end remains to be seen, but I hope at the very least I have been able to express why I believe that the social sciences will eventually be fused with biology.",11
1291,No natural boundary appears to exist between the natural and social sciences.,11
1292,"Their blend zone, a mysterious and sometimes prohibited domain, offers a great immediate potential for scientific discovery in the postulational-deductive and experimental tradition of the natural sciences.",11
1293,"EVOLUTION, ETHICS, AND THE REPRESENTATION PROBLEM BERNARD WILLIAMS",11
1294,"This paper is concerned with culture and with evolution, but not with cultural evolution.",11
1295,It discusses the relations between biological evolution and the areas of human culture which may broadly be called ‘ethical’.,11
1296,"The concept of evolution is problematical, and there are notorious difficulties about applying the notions of evolution and natural selection to cultural development; , the ends served by various cultural developments are themselves defined by culture, as are the ‘choices’ to which Wilson refers in his paper (this volume).",11
1297,"That area, however, is not the concern of the present discussion.",11
1298,"There are two kinds of connection between evolutionary theory and ethics: one normative, and one explanatory.",11
1299,"There is also a connection between these two, to which I shall come later.",11
1300,"The first of these is older than the second, and has acquired a bad name; indeed, it acquired it fairly early, in some part from the monumental and unappealing system of Herbert Spencer.",11
1301,"In fact, as John Burrow has shown (Burrow, 1966) a lot of this material ante-dated ; the concept of ‘the survival of the fittest’(Spencer's own phrase) was already implicit in earlier sociological work which Spencer derived from Malthus.",11
1302,"Darwin himself had little sympathy for these ideas and not much, personally, for Spencer, though he did once say — I quote Burrow (p. 182)—‘in a moment of enthusiasm…that Spencer's made him feel that he ‘is about a dozen times my superior’, and thought that Spencer might one day be regarded as the equal of Descartes and Leibniz, rather spoiling the effect by adding, ‘about whom, however, I know very little’’.",11
1303,"The bad normative applications of evolutionary theory to ethics which were made by Spencer and others also, , involved a lot of bad evolutionary theory: if normative lessons could be drawn from Darwinian  theory, there is certainly no reason why they should take the form suggested by Social Darwinists.",11
1304,"However, there is a standard objection which holds that no such lessons can be drawn , in any directly logical way, since any project of deriving ethical content from premisses of evolutionary theory commits the ‘naturalistic fallacy’, an error which is today often equated with that of trying to derive from .",11
1305,Interesting questions about ‘naturalism’ in ethics in fact go beyond these purely logical issues.,11
1306,Naturalism in a broader sense consists in the attempt to lay down certain fundamental aspects of the good life for man on the basis of considerations of human nature.,11
1307,"If this project falls, it is not for purely logical reasons; it will rather be for the more interesting reason that the right sort of truths do not exist about human nature.",11
1308,I shall come back to this wider question at the end of this paper.,11
1309,"The point about and , so far as it goes, does have some force.",11
1310,It can be put in the following way.,11
1311,Suppose that considerations of evolutionary theory show that certain behaviour is in some sense appropriate for human beings.,11
1312,"Either human beings can diverge from this pattern, or they cannot.",11
1313,"If they can, then the biological considerations are not going to show that they ought not to; while, if they cannot so diverge, then there is no question of .",11
1314,"This argument seems to me sound so far as it goes, but it does not go very far.",11
1315,"Implicit in this last argument is another logical relation which is more interesting for this question than that between and : the relation, , between and .",11
1316,"This relationship underlies some important negative arguments which by citing certain claims to the effect that human beings cannot, as they may suppose, live in a certain way, lead to the conclusion that certain ethical goals or ideals are unrealistic and should be revised.",11
1317,"By arguments of this kind, biological or similar arguments could coherently yield on social goals, personal ideals, possible institutions .",11
1318,"To say that human beings do certain things is, , an extremely vague form of statement.",11
1319,"At one extreme, it may mean that the world will not contain an example of any single human being doing that thing; at the other end, it may merely mean that if a group of human beings  adopt a norm requiring that behaviour, the norm will often be broken, its observance will give rise to a good deal of anxiety, those who comply without anxiety to the norm will be unusual in other respects, .",11
1320,"This vagueness will not matter one is clear about the level at which the formula of ‘implies ’ is being applied: thus the latter, and weaker, ‘cannot’would be enough to provide a strong argument against the behaviour being made into a norm for a human society, but it would not be enough if the question concerned the adoption of a personal ideal in an individual case.",11
1321,"Here, as so often, it is a centrally important question, who is supposedly being addressed by a given piece of ethical discourse.",11
1322,"Granted that one is clear about that, the fact that relevant statements of what human beings can and cannot do come in various strengths is not so important.",11
1323,"What is vitally important is the difficulty of knowing which of them, relevant to difficult ethical issues, are on biological grounds in fact true.",11
1324,"In this area there is an important connection, which I mentioned before, between what I called the normative and the explanatory interest.",11
1325,"If some biological constraint can rule out, or make unrealistic, some normative practice or institution, then knowledge of it may not only encourage us to decline that practice if it is suggested, but may also contribute an explanation of why human communities do not display that practice or institution.",11
1326,"Might biological considerations then go further and explain the human adoption of other practices, which are conformable to biological constraints?",11
1327,"This raises a general question which is central to these areas, and which I shall call .",11
1328,"It is a problem which comes up at various points in considering the relations between biology and human practices, and may be put in the following way:?",11
1329,"It may be said that in some cases, , such a tendency will show up in that species merely as itself — , as a merely biological character of that species.",11
1330,"But, in fact, virtually no behavioural tendency which constitutes genuine action can just show up in a cultural context ‘as itself’.",11
1331,"Where there is culture, it affects everything, and we should reject the crude view that culture is applied to an animal in a way which leaves its other characteristics unmodified.",11
1332,"(Related to that view is the naive assumption of certain sociobiologists that sociobiology should expect to be more closely related to social anthropology than to other social sciences, because the ‘primitive’ peoples studied by social anthropology are nearer to nature than  human beings who live in large industrialized societies.)",11
1333,"None of this is to deny that there is a biological basis for elements in human behaviour which are culturally affected, moulded and elaborated.",11
1334,It is not to deny that some culturally elaborated behaviour can usefully be explained from a biological perspective.,11
1335,"It is simply to recall the fact that almost all human behaviour, that which deserves the name of ‘action’, is in fact culturally moulded and elaborated.",11
1336,"In accepting that there is a representation problem, I reject two views which there would be no such problem.",11
1337,"First is a simple reductionist view, which would neglect the way in which culture not only shapes but constitutes the vast mass of human behaviour.",11
1338,"When ancient Greek thought first discovered the opposition of ‘nature’ and ‘convention’, it also discovered that an essential part of human nature is to live by convention.",11
1339,"The study of human nature , in good part, the study of human conventions, and that is what it is from the strictest ethological point of view.",11
1340,That is how species is.,11
1341,"It is a claim additional to this, but one which I also believe to be true, that human conventions, beyond a certain state of elaboration, can be understood only with the help of history, and that the social sciences accordingly have an essential historical base.",11
1342,"To pursue the question of whether that is so, would go beyond the limits of the present discussion, but it is worth bearing in mind, when the relations are discussed of biology to the social sciences, that an essential social science is likely to prove to be history.",11
1343,"The second point of view which is excluded by taking seriously the representation problem is one which I am disposed, perhaps unfairly, to call ‘the Wittgensteinian cop-out’.",11
1344,This is a view implicit in the idea that the central concept for gaining insight into human activities is that of a ‘language game’.,11
1345,"Since ‘language’ in this formulation is regarded both as the key to human convention, and also as something which human beings possess and animals do not, the phrase itself implies the lack of interesting explanatory or constraining connections between human and animal behaviour.",11
1346,"It suggests an autonomy of the human, under a defining idea of linguistic and conceptual consciousness, which tends to put a stop to any interesting questions of the biological kind before they even start.",11
1347,"It therefore does not give any help even in the areas, sex and hunger, where we most obviously need means of describing the relations between culture and the biological.",11
1348,"The feature of human culture and human activities that gives rise to the representation problem is above all that human communities embody , and it is this notion that I shall principally discuss.",11
1349,"However, there  are other ways, , of picking out differences between human activities and those of other animals.",11
1350,"One is the very general feature that humans possess conceptual and reflexive consciousness; this, and the very large philosophical problems introduced by those three terms, I shall happily leave on one side.",11
1351,Another distinction between human and animal behaviour is that considerations of are appropriate to the assessment of human action.,11
1352,"This is a matter that is worth some brief discussion, since it is closely connected with the fuss that has been made about the application of the term ‘altruism’ to animal human behaviour.",11
1353,"In other animals there is behaviour which benefits another individual, and moreover there is behaviour the end of which is to benefit another individual, in a sense of ‘end’ which requires a lot of work to make clear, but which is uncontentiously illustrated by behaviour the end of which is that the animal should take in food.",11
1354,"In the human case, many more layers can be added, and other distinctions drawn.",11
1355,"There are questions of intention, where this concerns what thoughts produce the action, and what features of the action are, that thought, accidental.",11
1356,There are questions of underlying desire.,11
1357,"Some actions which benefit others come from the desire just to benefit that particular person, while others flow from some more general disposition, while the desire to benefit a particular person or group may be accompanied by a variety of other desires, to extract goodwill from them, or the possibility of a reward.",11
1358,The cultural and psychological elaboration of these various motives raises difficulties for any simple relation of them to the biological.,11
1359,Some of those difficulties arise just from the general problem of applying biological models to a species which engages in intentional thought; to that extent there is no problem about altruism and morality.,11
1360,"People think that there is a special barrier here to the application of biological models, I believe, because they take ‘altruism’, in a ‘properly moral’ sense, to refer to some quite peculiarly pure motive, the intention to benefit others derived from impartial reflection on their interests and associated with no other desire whatsoever.",11
1361,"But it is extremely unreasonable to suppose that all (perhaps any) human beings act from that motivation, either, and if morality is to be a generally human phenomenon, it is simply a mistake to equate it from the beginning with such exigently Kantian formulations, and it is a mistake even from the point of view of the human sciences.",11
1362,"It is true that a biological perspective will make one more suspicious of extremely intellectualist or, again, very purist views of morality; but equally, so will a reasonable historical and psychological understanding of morality.",11
1363,It is the notion of a that perhaps gives rise to the central representation problem.,11
1364,"The main point is condensed in the question raised by Pat Bateson in his paper (this volume), about the relation between an inhibition and a prohibition.",11
1365,"The most, it seems, that a genetically acquired character could yield would be an inhibition against behaviours of a certain kind; what relation could that have to a socially sanctioned prohibition?",11
1366,"Indeed, if the inhibition exists, what could there be for such a prohibition?",11
1367,"If the prohibitory norm is to be part of the ‘extended phenotype’ of the species, how could we conceive, starting from an inhibition, that this should come about?",11
1368,"This is a central example of the problem, but it is not the only example even norms, and it will be helpful to distinguish various things that fall under the general heading of a ‘norm’.",11
1369,Not everything that falls under this heading is a sanctioned prohibition.,11
1370,"We can distinguish various items; I will represent them as , in a way which is typical, but not by any means universal.",11
1371,(1),11
1372,Behaviour which is normal.,11
1373,"This does not just mean ‘frequent’: exceptions are perceived as ‘odd’, but are not necessarily disapproved of, sanctioned, etc.",11
1374,(2),11
1375,(1) together with an institution.,11
1376,"This can be applied to the case of marriage, where there will be usually sanctions of varying degrees against behaviours that threaten marriage, and sexual activity outside marriage may be disapproved of, but this does not imply that merely not engaging in marriage is disapproved of, nor that an unmarried condition is sanctioned.",11
1377,(3),11
1378,"Behaviour which lies outside (1) and (2), and to which there may be strong personal disinclination: e.g. homosexuality as regarded in enlightened circles.",11
1379,(4),11
1380,(3) together with rejection and disapproval of the deviant behaviour: e.g. homosexuality as regarded in less enlightened circles.,11
1381,(5),11
1382,(4) together with sanctions personal or legal: e.g. homosexuality in the least enlightened circles.,11
1383,"Among the cases in which the options are not stacked like this, is that in which the sanctions and disapproval exist against behaviour which is in fact frequent and not the subject, perhaps, of any deep personal disinclination; this, at the limit, is pure humbug, like the old school-master's attitude to masturbation.",11
1384,"(1) to (3) raise some difficulties for a biological approach, particularly institutions, and an adequate treatment of the representation problem will deal with all these levels.",11
1385,The question of  inhibitions and prohibitions arises most clearly at levels (4) and (5).,11
1386,"There is, moreover, a specially paradoxical version of it which arises from certain cases in which not only does extra conceptual content have to be introduced to characterize the human prohibition, but also the introduction of that content stands in conflict with the proposed biological explanation of it.",11
1387,"A clear example of this arises with the famous example of the incest taboo, which has been discussed by Bateson (this volume).",11
1388,"There are many incest taboos, , prohibitions on sexual relations between persons of various degrees of familial relation, and some of these are hardly even candidates for biological explanation.",11
1389,"Moreover, there may well be some very severe doubts about the application of the biological model even to the favourite cases.",11
1390,"The present discussion, is not, however, concerned with the factual merits of these explanations, but only with the shape that they take.",11
1391,"In other species, there are behavioural drives the function of which is to avoid inbreeding.",11
1392,"Such a drive, however, has to be operationalized in some other way, since the animals do not have any direct knowledge of the matters relevant to inbreeding: the inhibition against mating has to be triggered by the recognition of or reaction to some property adequately correlated with the kin relationship, being an individual with which the animal has been brought up.",11
1393,"It is inhibition that is allegedly displayed, in the well-known case, by those brought up in the kibbutz.",11
1394,But we have not yet reached any incest taboo.,11
1395,There are no sanctions against marrying those that one is brought up with (as such); the sanction is against marriages which would constitute close in-breeding.,11
1396,The conceptual content of the prohibition is thus different from the content that occurs in the description of the inhibition.,11
1397,"It indeed relates to the suggested of that inhibition, but that fact will not explain how the prohibition which is explicitly against in-breeding will have arisen.",11
1398,It certainly does not represent a mere ‘raising to consciousness’ of the inhibition.,11
1399,"It can have come about, in fact, only given human knowledge of relevant facts — presumably, of the ill-effects of in-breeding.",11
1400,"But once that is an essential step in the explanation, we need the biological element in the explanation (of the prohibition, , of the inhibition).",11
1401,"It turns out that we have to appeal in any case to something like a rational collective agency, directed towards avoiding recognized and agreed evils, and that provides an adequate explanation — a fairly traditional one — of the incest prohibition.",11
1402,"A similar paradox can arise with other norms supposedly based at a biological level, but there are cases that avoid it.",11
1403,"Consider the  ‘double standard’ in sexual morality, traced by Symons (1979) to the disparity between ovum and sperm.",11
1404,"This account, though it applies much more widely, is essentially the same as an explanation of these social phenomena which goes back to Hume, who accounted for ‘the artificial virtues of chastity and modesty in women’ by referring to the naturally greater disposition of males to protect children that they believe to be their own.",11
1405,"Here again, there may be serious doubts about relevant anthropological facts, but the present point concerns the principle of the explanation, which involves an important difference from the incest case.",11
1406,"Here, it natural to think the institutionalization of a disposition which could be displayed in a simpler form pre-culturally.",11
1407,"The conceptual content required in this case to describe the institution, though it involves a great deal of cultural elaboration, does not display the same kind of break between the pre-cultural and the cultural as is found in the incest case; and the biological pattern of explanation could recognizably run through such ideas as human beings finding certain institutions ‘natural’, which does not require any appeal to a rational collective agency to understand the basic biological idea, as is damagingly the case with the incest example.",11
1408,"In fact, an explanation which went back to a biologically grounded disposition could in this case precisely avoid the invocation of rational collective agency, which is rather an intellectualist embarrassment to the story as Hume (1738–40) tells it.",11
1409,"None of this implies that such biological elements did play some role in explaining these institutions, the institutions would then be necessary or unchangeable — the explanation were true, this could still be a case in which becoming conscious of their rationale was a help in changing them.",11
1410,"In one of the two cases we have considered — incest — the prohibition is paradoxically related to pre-cultural dispositions: it expresses their function, but not their content.",11
1411,"In the case just considered, social institutions could in principle be an expression of a pre-cultural disposition.",11
1412,"In other cases, again, the existence of norms seems to be a for a pre-cultural disposition.",11
1413,This might well be so with the control of aggression and of self-seeking behaviour; I shall make one or two remarks about this question without pursuing it .,11
1414,"In the work of Maynard Smith and others (see, , Maynard Smith, this volume) games theory is applied to explaining selection genetically based patterns of behaviour.",11
1415,Games theory can equally be applied to characterizing human norms which are instituted against aggression and other non-cooperative behaviour.,11
1416,"(Ullmann-Margalit (1977) gives a recent analysis, though the outlines of the idea that  sanctioned norms can represent a solution to the Prisoners' Dilemma can be found in Hobbes.)",11
1417,"The principles of the two applications of games theory are in many ways the same but their results point, in a sense, in opposite directions.",11
1418,"If sanctioned norms are necessary in the human case, or socialization into rule-observing behaviour, this must be because constraints on human responses in these areas are not, or not significantly, genetically based.",11
1419,"Granted structures of the Prisoners' Dilemma type, cooperative behaviour can be secured only granted a certain level of assurance, and the need of norms (of sanctioned norms) to produce that assurance shows that the assurance cannot be adequately delivered by genetically based signals.",11
1420,"It is very tempting to suppose that the lack of any such reliable signals, and the perilously low level of security often reached in human communities, must be connected with a high level of conceptual and, , predictive thought, and also an associated capacity for deceit.",11
1421,This perhaps gives a special force to the Voltairean remark about the function of language being to conceal thought.,11
1422,The previous remarks have raised some questions about the relations between human norms and possible underlying dispositions determined at a biological level.,11
1423,"They represent some aspects of what I have called the representation problem, and it is only through further investigation of that problem, and by becoming clearer about how the various kinds of norm relate to our biological inheritance, that we can come to see much about what biological constraints there might be, beyond the obvious ones, on social and ethical arrangements.",11
1424,"I do not believe it to be excluded that there could be some, and I do not believe that very much is to be achieved by very general assertions or denials of the possibility.",11
1425,"What is needed is more detailed analysis, not only anthropological but philosophical, of the demands that any explanations of this sort would have to meet.",11
1426,"It will be needed, above all, if we are to be able to read the historical record.",11
1427,"It is only if we can read that record that we can discover some very important biological characteristics of human beings, since (to repeat an earlier point) it is through convention, convention that has a history, that human nature is expressed.",11
1428,"It is not merely that without a hold on the representation problem we cannot discover the relevant content in the historical record; without understanding that problem, we cannot adequately control the idea that there is any relevant content .",11
1429,"If a biologically grounded disposition showed up simply in the form of what human beings could not or would not do, then there would be no real problem of alternative behaviours.",11
1430,"The alternatives will simply be absent from the record, and it is unlikely that anyone, except as the most extreme  perversity, would want to undertake them.",11
1431,"This, , is the area in which the argument scores its clear but uninteresting success.",11
1432,"What is much more interesting, I have already suggested, is the idea that there could be patterns of behaviour which human beings are entirely capable of wanting and indeed, on an individual or limited scale, of achieving, but which for biological reasons are bound to be psychologically costly, or confined to a small group of otherwise unusual individuals, or otherwise bound to fail as social institutions.",11
1433,"To understand how this could be involves some understanding of the representation problem, and to decide that any given pattern of behaviour has this character of being, as one might put it, ‘biologically discouraged’ requires one to be able to read the historical record.",11
1434,"It hardly needs emphasizing that on any question that is interesting, social roles of the sexes, we would have to be able to read the historical record better than we now can to arrive at any strong conclusions about what is biologically discouraged.",11
1435,"I come back finally to what I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter as the area of ‘naturalism’ more broadly conceived: , the question of founding human ethics on considerations of human nature, in some way which goes beyond merely respecting the limits, biological or other, on what human beings are able to do.",11
1436,"This is the project of thinking out, from what human beings are like, how they might best and most appropriately live.",11
1437,Such a project continues to attract some philosophers.,11
1438,Its attractions are obvious.,11
1439,"It does not, in any obvious way, require any supernatural warrant, while it is less arbitrary or relativistic than other secular ways of looking at the content of morality.",11
1440,It seems to offer some promise of being both well-founded and contentful.,11
1441,"It seems to me that a correct understanding of human evolution is very relevant to projects of this kind, but that the effect of that understanding is largely discouraging to them.",11
1442,This is for two different kinds of reason.,11
1443,The first is a reason at a more particular and factual level and is correspondingly more sensitive than the other to changes in hypotheses about the emergence of human beings.,11
1444,"It is simply that the most plausible stories now available about that evolution, including its very recent date and also certain considerations about the physical characteristics of the species, suggests that human beings are to some degree a mess, and that the rapid and immense development of symbolic and cultural capacities has left man as a being for which no form of life is likely to prove entirely satisfactory, either individually or socially.",11
1445,"Many have come to that conclusion before, and those who have tried to reach a naturalistic  morality which transcends it have had to read the historical record, or read beyond the historical record, in ways which seek to reveal a partly hidden human nature which is waiting to be realized or perfected.",11
1446,"The evolutionary story, to the extent that it can now be understood (and to the much more modest extent to which I understand it myself) seems to me to give some support to the view that in this respect the historical story means very much what it seems to mean.",11
1447,"The second and more general reason lies not in the particular ways in which human beings may have evolved, but simply in the fact that they have evolved, and by natural selection.",11
1448,"The idea of a naturalistic ethics was born of a deeply teleological outlook, and its best expression, in many ways, is still to be found in Aristotle's philosophy, a philosophy which there is inherent in each natural kind of thing an appropriate way for things of that kind to behave.",11
1449,On that view it must be man's deepest desire — need?— purpose?— satisfaction?— to live in the way that is in this objective sense appropriate to him (the fact that modern words break up into these alternatives expresses the modern break-up of Aristotle's view).,11
1450,"Other naturalistic views, Marxist and some which indeed call themselves ‘evolutionary’, have often proclaimed themselves free from any such picture, but it is basically very hard for them to avoid some appeal to an implicit teleology, an order which there would be an existence that would satisfy all the most basic human needs .",11
1451,"The first and hardest lesson of Darwinism, that there is no such teleology , and that there is no orchestral score provided from anywhere which human beings have a special part to play, still has to find its way fully into ethical thought.",11

3,"Policy in Islington, 1983–8",12
4,"Margaret Boushel, Clare Debenham, Lisa Dresner and Anna Gorbach",12
5,"During the 1980s Margaret Boushel, Claire Debenham, Lisa Dresner and Anna Gorbach worked in the London borough of Islington within social services for pre-school children.",12
6,This chapter is an account of the way they perceived attempts to develop integrated provision for under fives and the barriers in attitudes and systems which were encountered.,12
7,The first section provides an overview of provision and services in 1983.,12
8,The next section describes attempts to create a clear under-fives policy.,12
9,The third section looks at the faltering progress towards integrated services.,12
10,"The fourth section examines the formidable barriers that were posed by reorganisation of social services, local authority cuts and the demise of the Inner London Education Authority.",12
11,The chapter concludes with a mixture of resignation and determination.,12
12,"BACKGROUND: UNDER-FIVES SERVICES IN ISLINGTON, 1983",12
13,"Islington is a multi-ethnic, inner city London borough with a child population of 29,000.",12
14,"In 1982, 44 of under fives in Islington had the use of an under-fives facility, 29 on a full-time and 15 on a part-time basis.",12
15,"Between 1982 and 1988 provision gradually increased, by 1988 there were 12 children's day centres, about 70 playgroups and 350 assisted child-minding places funded partially or totally by the Social Services Department, and 1,075 full-time and 824 part-time places in nursery schools funded by the Inner London Education Authority.",12
16,"The Beacon Nursery, a local Mencap project, offered care five days per week to children over one year of age categorised as having severe learning difficulties.",12
17,"Unlike council day centres, playgroups or community nurseries, the Beacon Nursery was free.",12
18,Children were collected from home by special bus and places were available on demand.,12
19,The Beacon had been in existence for many years and in the past had catered for thirty children with a wide range of disabilities and needs.,12
20,By 1983 it had half that number on roll.,12
21,Since 1983 numbers at the Beacon continued to fall as it was increasingly seen as a resource for children with severe and multiple disabilities.,12
22,"the Elfreda Rathbone  organisation, a voluntary organisation helping people with learning disabilities, ran a free day nursery in the borough for a small number of children with learning difficulties.",12
23,"Some integrated services emerged in the early 1980s — one playscheme was developed through a parent's initiative, and an integrated adventure playground was established by a voluntary organisation.",12
24,Workers from the integrated playscheme subsequently supported a local special school in integrating under fives into a playgroup.,12
25,"its mainstream schools, the borough included five special schools providing primary and secondary education to children with special needs from Islington and neighbouring boroughs — one for children with moderate learning difficulties, one for children with severe learning difficulties, one for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties, one for autistic children, and one for children with physical disabilities.",12
26,In 1983 three of these offered nursery places to children from the age of 2.,12
27,"The children using all of these services came from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds, though rarely was this actively and positively reflected in the type of care provided or the ethnic background of their carers.",12
28,Residential units,12
29,"By 1983 residential services were designed with ‘care in the community’ in mind, but most were based in specialist settings.",12
30,", Field End House had been open for three years as a specialist unit for children with learning difficulties, and was designed to offer respite ‘round the clock’ care.",12
31,Parents had fought for this as a local resource to prevent the need for children to be placed in long-stay placements far from home.,12
32,By 1988 Field End had been joined by another specialist children's respite care unit at Leigh Road.,12
33,"The Social Services Department also provided thirteen short-term and long-term residential units for children in care (by 1988 their number had been reduced to eleven), none with wheelchair access and only one with any experience of caring for children with learning difficulties.",12
34,The Community Health Team,12
35,The Community Health Team had major responsibility for assessing children and recommending provision.,12
36,"It included physiotherapists, occupational and speech therapists, doctors, psychologists and a specialist health visitor.",12
37,"They were joined in the network by specialist teachers, funded by the ILEA and based in the special schools, who visited children at home before they were due to start school.",12
38,This group of people met on a regular basis to coordinate services and discuss professional issues.,12
39,Discussion of services to individual children also took place.,12
40,"This included deciding between day care or school, and parents' attitudes  to different options.",12
41,Often a member of the group was delegated to advise parents on a course of action.,12
42,"The Community Health Team aim was to ensure a place of treatment for children from the earliest possible age, to enable them to develop to their fullest potential.",12
43,"They were, however, an all-White group, operating without directly involving parents and were generally committed to care in the community.",12
44,They gave support to the Beacon and Elfreda Rathbone nurseries and most members saw these settings as the best places to ‘treat’ children.,12
45,their early contact with parents they often had considerable influence in steering parents towards specialist provision.,12
46,The Special Services Team,12
47,In the early 1980s social workers were funded jointly by the ILEA and Islington Social Services Department to work with children attending two special schools and two specialist units for ‘partially hearing’ children.,12
48,These social workers were based in the borough's Special Services Team.,12
49,They all worked with some under fives attending the schools they covered.,12
50,They were aware of a number of pre-school children who did not have adequate access to resources or support when parents and professionals were becoming aware of the possible extent and implications of the disability.,12
51,When a vacancy arose within this group of social workers in 1983 it was decided to appoint someone specialising in work with under fives with special needs.,12
52,This might have had the effect of drawing families into the specialist system at an earlier stage.,12
53,"Instead, for a number of reasons, it proved to be a key step in the development of the debate about integration in Islington.",12
54,"First, the post was not attached to any specialist institution.",12
55,There was an expectation but not a contractual obligation that the postholder would work closely with the Beacon Nursery.,12
56,"Second, the worker had an alternative peer group of under-fives workers who were key figures in controlling access to all other under-fives facilities.",12
57,"Third, the worker was committed to the idea that treatment of a medical or disabling condition should not take precedence over the child's social, emotional and cultural needs.",12
58,There was now a new worker in the network who also made an early relationship with families but who could present a broader choice of day care to parents.,12
59,ATTEMPTING AN INTEGRATION POLICY,12
60,"The Labour Council, elected in 1982, had as a stated policy aim that every child whose parents so wished was entitled to a pre-school place of some sort.",12
61,This led to the initiation of an under-fives review.,12
62,"The review team, set up under the auspices of the Social Services Committee, included councillors, senior departmental management and representatives of the children's day centre organisers and under-fives social workers in its membership.",12
63,It proposed a network of  under-fives centres throughout the borough — an idea which the under-fives workers had been anxious to promote for some time.,12
64,"Day care in each area would be organised and coordinated through the children's day centres which would also provide information, support and resources to parents.",12
65,The review had made no mention of children with special needs.,12
66,The specialist social worker and another under-fives worker with a personal interest in the issues undertook a supplementary review to examine resources for these children.,12
67,"They interviewed parents, specialist professionals and mainstream day-care workers and they designed a questionnaire which was completed by workers in a large proportion of mainstream council services and voluntary organisations, by some child-minders.",12
68,"Broadly, the survey confirmed that parents of children with special needs had not been given a real choice of placement, and that they had to fight hard for mainstream provision if this was their choice.",12
69,Parents wanted to be part of the decision-making and did not feel that they were.,12
70,Many commented on lack of information about the range of facilities on offer.,12
71,"One Afro-Caribbean woman described how she felt that she was never given a choice of provision for her son, and objected to being told he should be in a specialist nursery for his own good.",12
72,She fought hard to get him a part-time playgroup place in the group his older brother attended.,12
73,Because the group had known her and her children for some time they agreed to ‘have a go’ and the placement went ahead.,12
74,She commented:,12
75,I had to fight every step of the way for this.,12
76,"told me about it, and wanted him to have it.",12
77,I knew it was right for him — this is where he learnt to join in and be like other children.,12
78,It doesn't matter that he's not like them.,12
79,"I know what is right for my child, but I'm not supposed to say.",12
80,"Parents also wanted an increased availability of specialist ‘therapy’ time, but wanted it to be used in a more flexible way.",12
81,Some parents were very worried that more integrated settings would lead to lack of attention for children with special needs.,12
82,"Definitions of ‘special needs’ varied widely in the questionnaire responses — some defining it as children with disabilities, some including children with behavioural and emotional problems and some including children whose first language was not English.",12
83,This made the survey difficult to interpret.,12
84,"The findings were documented in a report (CCUF 1983) and an analysis was prepared of the practical and bureaucratic problems in gaining an ordinary childcare place for a child with special needs, with suggestions for how these might be overcome.",12
85,"These ideas were informed by a paper which had already been produced by an active member of the local Mencap group, who had previously tried to generate the debate within the Community Health Service through the Mencap committee.",12
86,The conference: ‘A place for all our children',12
87,"As a result of this work the Coordinating Committee for Under Fives (CCUF), an umbrella organisation of statutory and voluntary sector groups and individuals providing a service to under fives, decided to organise a conference to look at the issues of integration of special needs children within mainstream provision.",12
88,the conference various groups met to produce short contributions to the debate.,12
89,"These included parents, under-fives workers, specialist workers, children's day centre organisers and playgroups organisers.",12
90,Each of these groups came up with a list of proposals which were sent to everyone attending.,12
91,"About 230 people attended the conference, held in April 1985.",12
92,"Workshops facilitated by the speakers and the conference organising group examined integration policies, overcoming practical problems for children in integrated provision and available sources of information.",12
93,The conference made the following recommendations:,12
94,1,12
95,"For a formal, universal information system, covering local and specialist resources.",12
96,2,12
97,For children's needs to be considered with parents and their wishes acknowledged and recognised.,12
98,3,12
99,"For employment of extra staff where needed, and employment of peripatetic special needs workers.",12
100,4,12
101,"For availability of money for equipment, toys and adaptations.",12
102,5,12
103,For enhanced payments to child-minders caring for children with special needs.,12
104,6,12
105,For priority status for children with special needs to facilitate access to ordinary provision.,12
106,7,12
107,"For training facilities for staff in ordinary provision, specialist provision and child-minders.",12
108,8,12
109,For greater communication and sharing of resources between ordinary and specialist provision.,12
110,9,12
111,"For therapeutic and professional staff to reflect the cultural backgrounds of the children, and that for all children, including those with special needs, their day-care environment and activities to express a consciousness of the multicultural society in Islington.",12
112,"It was made clear that all of the above areas needed funding from health, education and social services before they could be implemented.",12
113,"Finally, it was felt that unless the attitudes of advisers and information-givers became more positive towards integration, none of the recommendations could be effective.",12
114,The Social Services Department had responsibility for carrying out many of the recommendations of the conference.,12
115,"The message came loud and clear from all quarters that until council services were more welcoming to children with special needs, parents would continue to choose specialist provision caution.",12
116,"Unfortunately, at this point neither senior management staff in the Social  Services Department nor the local councillors involved in the conference presented the Conference Report to the Social Services Committee for ratification as council policy.",12
117,The core group who organised the conference were basic grade workers in the department who did not know the processes by which policy change is effected.,12
118,As a result there was no informed discussion within the department or at the Social Services Committee about resource issues and the status of the recommendations remained vague.,12
119,The sub-committee,12
120,"In the absence of official support we established a Special Needs Sub-committee of the Coordinating Committee for Under Fives to further the conference recommendations and the proposals of The Fish Report (ILEA 1985) on special education provision within ILEA, which favoured integration.",12
121,"The group eventually included representatives from health, education and social services with a small representation of parents and voluntary groups.",12
122,Battles were waged in meetings of the sub-committee and the level of organisational resistance to change became clear.,12
123,Many community health workers attended and expressed their scepticism about moves to greater integration.,12
124,They said children needed trained professionals to care for them and carry out their treatment programmes.,12
125,"They also felt that specialist workers could pass on skills and ideas to others, but it would take time.",12
126,"If children were integrated, workers would have to travel to many different centres and spend time training carers.",12
127,"Their aim was care in the community, but not anywhere in the community!",12
128,"Interestingly, few of the workers at the Beacon or Elfreda Rathbone had ‘specialist’ training, but they had experience of specialist segregated provision and an approach which focused on the ‘special needs’of a child on ‘total needs’.",12
129,THE PROGRESS OF INTEGRATION,12
130,"Despite professional and organisational inertia and resistance, some things did happen!",12
131,There were a number of areas where greater willingness was apparent to include children with special needs and make services more locally responsive.,12
132,Day-care provision,12
133,"Successful integrated day-care placements for under fives were negotiated by the specialist social worker and the parents, or sometimes the parents alone or the parents with another committed individual.",12
134,"It involved hard work and long discussions, dealing with fears, anxieties and practical problems, which needed to continue long after the child had been placed.",12
135,"day centres or playgroups were willing they were often still very nervous, and afraid of making mistakes.",12
136,This could lead to over-protectiveness and care had to be taken to ensure that a child was involved in all the group's activities.,12
137,Playgroups,12
138,Following the CCUF conference playgroups responded most rapidly.,12
139,To some degree they had already been catering for children with special needs.,12
140,"their small size and their close connections with local parents, playgroups were responsive and flexible in their way of working.",12
141,"Despite unsuitable premises, lack of funding and a dearth of promised support from the council, many groups tried hard to accommodate children's needs.",12
142,"Their staff were generally willing to ‘have a go’, and with some information and support went a long way in challenging their own attitudes and those of other children and parents.",12
143,"Some children moved specialist provision into playgroups (full or part time) and made considerable strides in social relationships, becoming part of a community and friendship network which continued into their schooldays, they went to special school at 5 years.",12
144,Day centres,12
145,Some individual placements were being made in children's day centres.,12
146,"Although it was policy for all children to be welcome in council provision, in reality this was highly variable.",12
147,"Access was dependent on parents receiving the information and encouragement to apply, experiencing the organiser and staff of the centre as welcoming and willing to learn about and accommodate the child's needs.",12
148,"They had to be willing, too, to wait for a place to become available.",12
149,Some extremely successful placements have been made in council day centres.,12
150,Sometimes centres were able to relieve any additional pressure on staff by allocating the equivalent of two places to one child.,12
151,In some cases extra support has been unnecessary.,12
152,Child-minding,12
153,"A few children were also placed with child-minders, who were awarded additional payments by the council if the child required sufficient extra attention that s/he needed to take up one place.",12
154,This led to battles with senior management who questioned the status of the policy decision to implement the new system.,12
155,The specialist nursery,12
156,"The Beacon Nursery was taken over by the council, as requested by Mencap.",12
157,This could have provided opportunities for structural change and review.,12
158,These never took place.,12
159,Senior management failed to take a lead in clarifying the role of the Beacon in the department's services to under fives.,12
160,What did happen was that the nursery staff felt themselves to be part of a wider childcare system and took advantage of formal and informal links.,12
161,There was exchange of information and  sometimes of staff and children.,12
162,"The nursery was also influenced by the council's equal opportunities policies — , staff took part in a conference considering anti-racist strategies with under fives.",12
163,"A consideration of these ideas fostered the recognition that the children had social, racial and cultural identities disabilities.",12
164,"As a result of more able children taking up integrated placements or moving into school, the Beacon was now catering for a very small number of multiply disabled children, who were highly segregated as a result.",12
165,Residential provision,12
166,"As a result of two consultation days held to examine possibilities for greater integration in residential provision for children and young people with special needs, a series of recommendations were made to and accepted by the Social Services Committee in January 1987.",12
167,"These included: developing a respite care service, improving mobility access in children's residential units, providing disability awareness training, developing a coordinated assessment and review system for all children arid developing services for young adults.",12
168,Most of these recommendations affected services for under fives.,12
169,Respite care,12
170,"The Family Care Scheme, which provided care for children in their own homes was from its inception open to children with disabilities and their families.",12
171,"Again this was possible, , because the scheme coordinator was personally committed to such provision.",12
172,"Following the consultation days a pilot respite care scheme was begun offering twenty days respite care per year to ten families, to be planned at times and in ways to suit the families concerned.",12
173,Priority is being given to children with physical disabilities for whom no other respite care service exists in the borough.,12
174,Access,12
175,At the time of the consultation exercise no children's home in the borough had mobility access.,12
176,Since then plans were drawn up to make one short-term unit and one longer-term unit accessible.,12
177,"On completion, the use of day and residential facilities, including a family flat, were to be available to parents and children with physical disabilities or sensory impairments.",12
178,Disability awareness,12
179,"A small group of specialist and non-specialist staff and a couple of parents of children with special needs together devised a two-day training course on disability awareness, directed in the first instance at staff working with young children.",12
180,"The course included information and discussions about discrimination, legal issues, support services, parents' views and shared care.",12
181,"Parents, staff with disabilities, and specialist and non-specialist staff from the department and from local voluntary organisations were involved in running the course.",12
182,"It was attended by workers with under fives, children's residential staff and Family Care Scheme staff and found very useful.",12
183,"Staff were particularly positive about the contributions from parents, the information on the support available from local specialist workers, and the practical information on such things as lifting techniques, epileptic attacks, which was provided.",12
184,BARRIERS IN THE SYSTEM,12
185,"From 1985 onwards a number of additional formidable barriers to progress towards a coherent, integrated under-fives policy began to emerge.",12
186,Reorganising social services,12
187,"After 1985 the Social Services Department underwent fundamental structural change as its ten area teams, including under-fives workers, were redistributed to twenty-four Neighbourhood Offices as part of the council's decentralisation policy.",12
188,"Field, day and residential services changed to an integrated line management structure, all day and residential services were managed through the Neighbourhood Office in which they were situated.",12
189,"The Department was reorganised into five geographical districts, each managed by an assistant director who also had a responsibility for particular service areas.",12
190,The way these responsibilities were divided presented particular difficulties in work on integration.,12
191,"Three different assistant directors had responsibilities relating to children with disabilities — one for under fives, another for older children and their families, and a third for adults with physical and learning disabilities!",12
192,"Each Neighbourhood Office was allocated a half-time under-fives worker post, despite a large increase in workload.",12
193,It was almost inevitable that this would have a negative effect on any innovative work.,12
194,The issue of integration began to lose its visibility.,12
195,"Attitudes, especially among new senior staff, were often at variance with the council's stated philosophy towards under fives generally and towards integration .",12
196,The cuts,12
197,"As a result of central government policies, Islington social services suffered 8 in 1987/8 and all departments were asked to produce proposals for cuts of a further 25 which they might have to achieve over the next two years.",12
198,"Cuts of that level would decimate the existing service and make it almost impossible for underdeveloped areas of the service facilities for children with physical disabilities, imaginative respite, and family-based care schemes and improved under-fives facilities to be developed.",12
199,Under-fives services were not identified as a priority.,12
200,"Instead, it proposed that the Beacon and six other children's day centres be closed over the next two years, with an increase in supported child-minding placements to compensate, , for this loss.",12
201,The care provided by the Beacon was to transfer to special units in the remaining children's day centres.,12
202,"It is ironic that radical proposals for the integration of the Beacon, resisted by some specialist staff at all levels in the past, were now to be enforced by the cuts exercise.",12
203,"The danger was that the department would end up with the worst of both worlds — an integrated service provided in a hastily planned way, foisted on staff unprepared for the challenge and lacking the positive commitment and support that is so necessary from specialist staff and their managers.",12
204,The abolition of the ILEA,12
205,"Legislation in 1988 brought with it the central government decision to abolish the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) by 1990, despite the opposition of 93 of parents in Inner London.",12
206,"For Islington this meant that taking over the day-to-day running and management of the pre-school, school and adult educational facilities in its area, the borough had to provide resources in areas previously funded by ILEA, London-wide.",12
207,these London-wide resources have been used to provide facilities for children with special needs in specialist day and boarding schools.,12
208,The borough brought in a group of consultants to produce topic papers on twelve of the major areas affected by abolition.,12
209,"These included issues of equality, special needs and services for under fives.",12
210,"Before the decision on its abolition, the ILEA had already virtually abandoned the recommendations of The Fish Report, although some of the topic papers continued to support the idea of integration , unspecified ways.",12
211,"The paper on however, written by a former director of the local ILEA division, raised the integration principle as one which was again open for discussion and decision.",12
212,The document stated that the arguments for and against would be set out in some detail.,12
213,"The only argument stated in its favour, however, was to refer to The Fish Report ideas on equality.",12
214,The author (Roy price) then went on to state that integration may not be ‘practicable’; and that ‘segregation is a way to later integration’.,12
215,He gave the example of a two-year Community Skills course in a local college that drew its recruits from the special schools.,12
216,He also argued that the Campaign for Choice in Education advocated specialism.,12
217,It so happened that a local head of a special school was very involved in this campaign.,12
218,"Finally, he suggested that opportunities for increased parent/governor control and ‘opting-out’ under the Education Reform Act might mean that schools would become more competitive and less likely to want to pursue integration.",12
219,"Most people in Islington, councillors included, were unlikely to have read The Fish Report or to be aware of the arguments put forward in it.",12
220,In such a context Roy Price's description of the issues involved struck us as extremely lopsided.,12
221,The abolition of the ILEA also had a direct impact in the under-fives field.,12
222,The under-fives topic paper suggested that all group provision for under fives should be organised through the new borough Education Department.,12
223,This would lead to the transfer of children's day centres from social work to education and their possible future demise.,12
224,It contained a plan to halve the number of places in children's day centres from 1989.,12
225,"The number of subsidised child-minding places was to be increased, but this would not provide the group experience that is such a valuable aspect of day centre provision.",12
226,Neither would it allow for flexible staff allocation to meet the needs of children with particular disabilities.,12
227,"It was unclear where responsibility for child-minders, registration of playgroups, etc. would rest in the new organisation, but it was possible that the new provisions in the Children Bill going through parliament would allow for those services to be provided through education departments.",12
228,"Despite the difficulties in changing attitudes outlined in this chapter, there is little doubt that workers in mainstream social services provision were more prepared to accept the idea and practical implications of integration provision than those in mainstream education.",12
229,In such a situation the future for integration looked bleak.,12
230,The transfer of ILEA responsibilities to the council meant that future decisions around integration and children would be mainly the brief of the new Education Committee.,12
231,This committee was likely to be more responsive to lobbying and pressure from parents of children already in ‘mainstream’ schools and from the huge workforce in mainstream and specialist education.,12
232,Such a powerbase is potentially much more difficult to change in the interests of a small discriminated-against group.,12
233,The cuts and internal reorganisation in the ILEA also resulted in a total turn-about on decisions concerning the specialist social worker post.,12
234,"When the postholder left in December 1987, the post was redesignated to a special school.",12
235,all social workers in the Special Services Team were to be attached to special schools with under fives inevitably drawn into the specialist system again.,12
236,Shortly after this regressive move the post was cut completely.,12
237,CONCLUDING REMARKS,12
238,"In 1988, integrated placements are still being achieved ‘against the tide’.",12
239,"There was still a lack of commitment to integration from social services, health and education, individuals within those services were becoming increasingly willing to help.",12
240,Parents were still placed under enormous pressure to choose specialist resources ‘in the interests of the child’: integrated placements were often presented as chiefly fulfilling a selfish need of the parents to deny their child's special needs.,12
241,A coordinated assessment and review system for all children had proved difficult to develop.,12
242,"Children with disabilities and their parents tend to have most contact with specialist health, education and social services during the child's  early years.",12
243,"Until the three agencies actively involve parents and staff from non-specialist areas in their assessment and review procedures and give equal weight to the promotion and consideration of integrated placements, such placements will remain a rarity.",12
244,Staff and parents need to be strongly motivated to seek an integrated placement in a children's day centre or nursery school.,12
245,The local specialist nursery for children with learning difficulties had a much shorter waiting list and took children from the age of 2.,12
246,"Within social services, respite care for children with learning difficulties was provided by the local specialist units.",12
247,It demanded interest and commitment the workers to try and set up respite fostering or other more integrated arrangements as an alternative.,12
248,Placements are most successful when the policy-makers and professionals involved have a positive attitude to exploring integrated care and are willing to support the care-givers and the parents.,12
249,"Too often, unnecessary organisational problems undermine the process.",12
250,"At the end of 1987, three years after the conference ‘A place For All Our Children’, one council day centre offered a place to a child with a ‘learning difficulty’.",12
251,Some days later some staff raised objections at a staff meeting and the offer was withdrawn.,12
252,Because council officers still fail to enforce council policy and because individuals involved in management are still unwilling to grasp the nettle and take up the argument the child lost the place.,12
253,Cost is not everything.,12
254,"It is very obvious from our experience that attitude is as crucial as cost, and arguments around cost sometimes act as a smoke-screen for negative attitudes.",12
255,"It is now more important than ever, as we endure and try to resist the demolition of the Welfare State, that children with special needs and their families do not suffer a disproportionate reduction in services.",12
256,"The shift in policy, attitudes and provision begun in the moves towards integration must a continued.",12
257,Community play,12
258,Veronica Hanson,12
259,"In this article, Veronica Hanson describes a scheme that was set up by the Welsh Pre-school Playgroups Association (PPA) to encourage the integration into local playgroups of children who experience difficulties in learning.",12
260,There is national funding for the scheme.,12
261,"Veronica Hanson describes the stages that the PPA proposal had to go through to be accepted by the Welsh Office and she goes on to describe how the county schemes are supported, managed and run they are in operation.",12
262,INTRODUCTION,12
263,Members of the Pre-School playgroups Association (PPA) in Wales (which became in independent association in 1987) are so convinced of each family's right to choice of provision for their children that they have taken positive steps to make this possible.,12
264,County ‘referral schemes’ have been established to ease the integration of children with special needs into the local playgroup or mother and toddler group.,12
265,Once a family contacts or is referred to the referral scheme coordinator every assistance is given to that family to link into their local community group to ensure that the group is physically suitable and that any special assistance needed to enable the child to attend the group and enjoy its activities is provided.,12
266,Playgroups and mother and toddler groups offer safe and stimulating play opportunities for the children and friendship for mother and child.,12
267,"Playgroups are set up and managed by parent members of the group, usually through a committee and employing a playgroup leader.",12
268,"The groups take place in a church or chapel hall or other community building and are supported by PPA voluntary area organisers and a network of volunteers at branch, county and Wales level.",12
269,FINDING THEIR WAY,12
270,"Children with special needs have long been welcomed into playgroups or mother and toddler groups but members have tended to worry on two counts — first, that only a minority of families with children with special needs were finding their  way to playgroup, and second that the playgroup was not fully able to meet the children's needs.",12
271,"Two counties, Clwyd and South Glamorgan, took the lead and the nucleus of a PPA special needs referral scheme was established in each county in the early 1980s.",12
272,In 1983 the Welsh Office produced a document —.,12
273,"This document proclaimed to the people of Wales that members of a society with mental handicap had a right to the same services as everyone else, had the right to be treated as individuals, and might need special assistance to make this possible.",12
274,The Welsh Office promised funding to initiatives developed by county social services departments voluntary organisations and families.,12
275,"Members of Wales PPA quickly realised that these published beliefs were the same as their own, and that here was perhaps an opportunity to avail themselves of much-needed funding to establish support systems which would enable families to take their rightful place in the local playgroup or mother and toddler group.",12
276,"Development of an All Wales Strategy has involved long discussions at county level between social services department personnel, representatives from voluntary organisations, parents and sometimes consumers.",12
277,PPA volunteers joined these discussions offering playgroups and mother and toddler groups as a resource for young children with mental handicap — an opportunity for integration right from the start.,12
278,"If integration at school age and afterwards is to be a real possibility a family with a handicapped child needs to be involved in the community, making friends and developing natural support systems from the beginning.",12
279,Every local authority was required to submit a county development plan for acceptance by the Welsh Office before funds were released.,12
280,PPA members sought to have their ‘referral schemes’ adopted and given high priority within the county plan.,12
281,"This involved PPA volunteers and staff in the tripartite consultations at county level, the preparation of budget submissions, agonising waits while plans were considered, elation when funding was agreed, disappointment when refused, months of hard work to set up a scheme or, when necessary, to re-draft the plan to try for funding again.",12
282,LIAISON,12
283,In 1985 the Welsh Office agreed to fund a Special Needs Liaison Officer for Wales PPA for three years to support the referral schemes in the counties.,12
284,By 1987 seven county-based PPA referral schemes had been established and a branch scheme set up in the eighth county.,12
285,Funding for the schemes is varied.,12
286,Every county his received some support from All Wales Strategy sources varying from core funding for a coordinator and placement costs for children with mental handicap to one-off grants or payment of incidental expenses.,12
287,Every county has had to seek additional funding to support placement costs for children who do  not have a mental handicap.,12
288,"Understandably there is reluctance within the authorities to diagnose a child under 5 as having a mental handicap, and there is a move to relax the criteria to include children with developmental delay amongst those eligible for funding.",12
289,"Alternative or additional funding has been sought from social services departments (non-Strategy), health authorities, education departments, Children in Need, trusts, and by fundraising.",12
290,Two schemes received grant aid from Under Fives Initiative (Wales) which came to an end in March 1988.,12
291,Each PPA county referral scheme is responsible for the finance and general administration of the scheme and employment of the coordinator.,12
292,"The financial requirements involve funding to employ a part-time coordinator and staff support for the scheme, expenses for coordinator and volunteers, training, publicity and placement costs for the child.",12
293,Placement costs vary need but are likely to involve token payment for an extra helper within the playgroups and may include transport cost and playgroup fees.,12
294,A toy library may be run the scheme.,12
295,The referral scheme works statutory bodies and professionals from the social services and education departments and health authorities who will be invited to referral scheme management groups.,12
296,"Coordinator and parent and playgroup will seek advice and support from the professionals involved with the child when this is appropriate — health visitor, social worker, physiotherapist, speech therapist, community mental handicap team.",12
297,"Essential equipment to enable a child to participate in a group may be provided, opportunities for training may be shared.",12
298,STATEMENTS,12
299,"The playgroup leader may be asked if she will support the parents' contribution to the Statement of special educational needs by describing the child's participation at playgroup, his needs and capabilities, adaptation and behaviour.",12
300,The playgroup leader will usually offer her observations as part of the parents' contribution to the Statement.,12
301,"She will not, indeed cannot, make any form of assessment but will, in discussion with the parent, describe the activities the child enjoys and his responses to playgroup life in a relaxed, familiar and friendly atmosphere.",12
302,"The educational psychologist may be invited to observe a child it playgroup should this be deemed useful hut will not, as a rule, carry out a formal assessment during playgroup time which would thus single the child out from his/her peers and probably deprive the other children of their leader's care.",12
303,PPA special needs referral schemes link into training courses organised generally by PPA within Wales and within the county — special needs is integrated into every foundation course and basic course.,12
304,"Training opportunities for helpers in the groups, for coordinators and management committees are offered.",12
305,Short ‘special needs’ courses or informal talks may be arranged to develop confidence and awareness and understanding of integration.,12
306,LIFE AFTER SCHOOL,12
307,An international perspective on transition,12
308,John Fish,12
309,"In this chapter John Fish draws on his experience working with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to provide an international perspective on the opportunities in work, training and education for young people with disabilities or learning difficulties.",12
310,He discusses the need for improving education and training and the way the contexts for transition to adult life have changed in the United Kingdom.,12
311,He argues for the coordination of agencies involved in supporting young people and considers the major issues these agencies need to address.,12
312,A number of initiatives in Europe and the United States are described.,12
313,Finally he considers the part education should play.,12
314,INTRODUCTION,12
315,Transition from school to adult and working life has been receiving increased attention in most developed countries over the last decade.,12
316,this was high levels of youth unemployment and latterly demographic trends.,12
317,These show a growing number of older people entering active retirement and much smaller youth age groups entering employment.,12
318,As a result it is important to create as many wage-earners and taxpayers as possible.,12
319,"A smaller labour market creates a window of employment opportunity for minority groups, including those who are disabled.",12
320,It presents a chance to establish employment as a natural conclusion to education and training for these groups.,12
321,In many instances expectations have been too low.,12
322,"When decisions about employability are based on school performance on work experience, training opportunities are often limited.",12
323,"Recent developments have shown that appropriate education, training and direct experience of work and living home, can enable a very significant proportion of those with severe disabilities to maintain themselves in employment and independent life.",12
324,For ten years the Centre for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has been studying aspects of integration and transition for young people who are disabled.,12
325,"A number of reports on issues and innovations have been published (OECD 1986, 1987, 1988).",12
326,Although the cultural traditions and education and social systems in OECD member countries vary there has been wide agreement about the importance of transition and the nature of the process.,12
327,The work has led to the development of a conceptual framework for a period which is both a phase and a process.,12
328,It is a time-phase between childhood and adulthood and a process of changing from a pupil to an independent working adult.,12
329,There is also agreement about many major issues which need to be addressed.,12
330,"Finally, there are a number of effective innovations which have been studied in detail.",12
331,"If the handicapping effects of disabilities are to be minimised, appropriate education, training and support been the early teens and the middle twenties is essential.",12
332,THE NEED FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING,12
333,The educational achievements of nearly half of all those completing the compulsory school period in the United Kingdom leave a lot to be desired.,12
334,", the academic standards of those receiving special education in secondary and special schools are not always impressive.",12
335,It is one of the inequalities of the education system that the more successful you are the longer you can remain in it and thus delay independence and entry to work.,12
336,Higher and flexible skill levels are now required in the labour market — an objective endorsed by both the CBI and TUC (CBI 1989).,12
337,This is a major reason for attention to transition.,12
338,"But, as a recent OECD publication (OECD 1990a) has shown, the United Kingdom, of all member countries, had the second lowest percentage of young people in full- or part-time education at the age of 17 in 1986 — 7.",12
339,"Although there has been some improvement, comprehensive preparation for an adult life, which includes employment, is not readily available to all who might need it.",12
340,In a European context there are many countries where a high proportion of the school population stay in school or technical education until after the age of 18.,12
341,In Scandinavia and North America it is rare for young people with severe disabilities to be expected to enter employment and to live independently until after education and training the early twenties.,12
342,THE CHANGING CONTEXTS,12
343,There is new legislation affecting every aspect of transition in the United Kingdom.,12
344,Those responsible for post-school education cannot ignore the changing context in which their work takes place.,12
345,"The Education Reform Act 1988 creates a new basis, the National Curriculum, from which to develop the further education contribution.",12
346,"It also creates a new framework for further and continuing education where marketing, effective performance and an appropriate response to community needs are increasingly important.",12
347,Social and Health Services have the Disabled persons Act 1986.,12
348,The parts  being implemented require that a life (transition) plan be prepared with individuals in collaboration with other agencies.,12
349,Sections concerned with the representation of disabled persons' interests are not being implemented .,12
350,The Children Act 1989 also requires greater cooperation between departments where the needs of children with disabilities are concerned.,12
351,This will be particularly true in the final years of school and in the initial preparation of an individual transition plan.,12
352,"‘Care in the community’, in whatever form it is introduced, will have a significant effect on transitions.",12
353,"The movement of individuals from institutional care to supporting arrangements in the community, the support of more people in their own homes, and the general management of disabilities by social services through individual care packages all create a new context to which a contribution from further education and training will be essential.",12
354,"Changes are also taking place in the benefit system which it is hoped may provide more flexible support for those who are disabled, and enhance their employment possibilities.",12
355,"Finally, new employment and training arrangements are being introduced through Training and Enterprise Councils.",12
356,"These will influence what education and training is available to support transition, how it is managed in an area, and who has access to it.",12
357,Education can only contribute one element to successful transition.,12
358,"To be really effective, lecturers and tutors must be sensitive to the contexts in which their institutions function and work closely with other training partners towards common ends.",12
359,COORDINATION AND CONTINUITY,12
360,"Although an individual makes many important transitions in a lifetime, that from school through adolescence to adult life is one of the most important.",12
361,For a young person with a disability or learning difficulty this transition is crucial.,12
362,"Transition is a personal and confused process for the individual but for national, local and voluntary departments and agencies it is a period of divided responsibilities and fragmentation.",12
363,"During the compulsory school period there are usually only two centres, home and school, which coordinate services for children.",12
364,After that period there are many independent contributors.,12
365,"The secondary school, the further education college and the adult education service, health, social and employment services, all have potential contributions to make as have voluntary agencies.",12
366,This confusion between providers is compounded by the different definitions used by departments and agencies to identify their clients.,12
367,", Education Acts use relative definitions of performance separating disability and performance but the 1986 Disabled persons Act uses 1948 social security definitions of disability.",12
368,"Some definitions may be administrative, others functional and some may encompass a wider group than others.",12
369,"After school, individuals can  move into and departmental definitions.",12
370,There are also attempts by agencies to establish an ownership of clients.,12
371,This is particularly evident where funding to agencies depends on clients served.,12
372,This may involve developing life plans with the individuals for whom they are responsible in isolation from other agencies.,12
373,"With so many players, the most important one — the young person — it is not surprising that there are no clear aims for the transition process.",12
374,"Indeed, in many countries, one government department may be paying huge sums to enable those with disabilities to become employable and to live independently while another is paying out larger sums they remain dependent and unemployable.",12
375,a coordinated approach to transition is difficult to achieve it should be possible for all concerned to agree a broad range of aims for transition.,12
376,The OECD/CERI programme (OECD 1986) has identified four general areas in which detailed objectives should be developed:,12
377,"Employment, useful work and valued activity.",12
378,"Personal autonomy, independent living and adult status.",12
379,"Social interaction, community participation, leisure and recreation.",12
380,Adult roles within the family including marriage.,12
381,Progress towards the achievement of these aims requires inter-agency collaboration.,12
382,"To pursue one aim, employment, in isolation from the others, the ability to travel to and from work and get on with other people, is ineffective.",12
383,Continuity is another significant ingredient in effective transition.,12
384,"OECD/ CERI work has identified three stages of the process — the final school years, further education and training, and the early years of employment and independent living — between which a continuity of approach is vital.",12
385,MAJOR ISSUES IN TRANSITION,12
386,A number of issues are common to national and international contexts.,12
387,They provide a useful agenda for discussion:,12
388,The starting point,12
389,Consideration of the process of transition needs to begin in the early years of secondary education.,12
390,The place of education is also important.,12
391,Attendance at a special school may automatically limit the choices subsequently offered to individuals when expectations are low and stereotyped.,12
392,The importance of further and continuing education is that valuable opportunities can be offered for individual self-appraisal and for the reassessment of potential together with the recognition of previous learning.,12
393,Inter-agency planning and collaboration,12
394,The United Kingdom is not alone in having traditional areas of responsibility and means of allocating resources which mitigate against joint planning and collaboration.,12
395,"Responsibility for individuals may be handed from one department or agency to another or individuals may be left to find their way through a maze of fragmented information, responsibilities and opportunities.",12
396,Empowerment,12
397,To fail to make a distinction between a disability and its handicapping effects at different times and in different situations may limit expectations.,12
398,"Effective education, experience and training can significantly reduce the handicaps which may arise from disabilities.",12
399,"Similarly, a lack of knowledge about the nature of transitions and uncertainty about relevant goals for those with disabilities may inhibit progress.",12
400,Professional and agency ownership of clients is also a major barrier to empowerment.,12
401,Transitional programmes should develop self-advocacy (FEU 1990a) and should result in the individual being supported and empowered to make decisions and plan his or her life.,12
402,"But the shift of power from parents and professionals to individuals with disabilities, especially those who require considerable physical care, is difficult to manage.",12
403,"Professionals and services have to manage the dual, and often conflicting, roles of support and empowerment.",12
404,"Ambivalence and uncertainty in departmental and agency policies and in the aspirations and practices of professionals, together with uncertainty about client demands, are all factors which work against empowerment.",12
405,Work with parents,12
406,Little professional work with parents is undertaken after the compulsory school period.,12
407,Parents have a crucial role to play in preparing their children for an independent adult life but may in practice unwittingly inhibit that progress.,12
408,"As work for the Further Education Unit (FEU 1990b) has shown, sensitive support is necessary to enable many parents to face the issues arising from their children's autonomy, empowerment and adulthood.",12
409,Supporting arrangements are rarely readily available.,12
410,The importance of parental support in effective transition cannot be overestimated.,12
411,Assessment,12
412,Transitional needs can only be met by assessment which both avoids categorisation and looks at the future needs of the individual.,12
413,"Assessment should be concerned with potential and the future education, training and support an individual might need.",12
414,"It is also important to recognise that, for many of those with disabilities, performance in one situation, school, is not always a good guide to performance in real living and working situations.",12
415,Too often decisions are:,12
416,1,12
417,based on past performance;,12
418,2,12
419,"confined to the requirements of one sector, e.g. education or employment; and",12
420,3,12
421,seldom based on experience and training in real situations.,12
422,New legislation lays particular stress on appropriate assessment.,12
423,"It is becoming increasingly clear that a transition plan, developed with the individual during the final years of schooling, to which all agencies agree to contribute is the only practical way of coordinating local services.",12
424,Continuity of support,12
425,"In the United Kingdom, as elsewhere, continuity of support for disabled individuals or their families through transition is rarely available.",12
426,The development of appropriate mechanisms to initiate and sustain the continuity of support and funding is a problem common to OECD member countries.,12
427,There is a need to provide a single point of reference (an individual guide or facilitator or a recognised team) for young people and their families throughout transition.,12
428,Professional rivalries often prevent a single person being the means by which services to meet individual needs are facilitated.,12
429,It is also necessary to understand that many people with disabilities are apprehensive of well-managed services providing continuity.,12
430,Such services may be seen as diminishing personal control and choice.,12
431,INNOVATIONS AND INITIATIVES,12
432,There are a number of interesting initiatives in the literature including those in the United Kingdom.,12
433,Those reported here are from other countries.,12
434,This is not because they are immediately transferable to this country but because they illustrate particular features of transition.,12
435,The final years of school,12
436,The work of Sailor and Wehman in the United States (Sailor .,12
437,"1989, Wehman .",12
438,1989) stresses the importance of an effective programme for individuals in high school.,12
439,(Sailor .,12
440,1989) gives details of school programmes.,12
441,Students with severe and profound disabilities and learning difficulties are entitled to attend high school the early twenties in the USA.,12
442,"Thus, the further education element in the United Kingdom is completed in the school  system although community colleges do similar work, often with an older age group, in the United States.",12
443,Sailor's book sets out a systematic training programme for young people with severe disabilities (SLD in this country) based on modified behavioural approaches.,12
444,This starts in the early teens and takes students into real living and working situations.,12
445,"Experiences in travelling, shopping and taking part in recreational activities in the community are carefully planned with clear behavioural objectives and criteria.",12
446,Vocational preparation is done in real situations in the community but use is also made of situations within schools to learn social and work skills.,12
447,An individual transition plan,12
448,The Individual Education plan (IEP) is a central feature of special education in the United States.,12
449,An Individual Transition plan is now being introduced to follow this.,12
450,The purpose of such plans is to coordinate the contributions of different agencies towards agreed transition goals which have been planned with young people and their families.,12
451,The features of such plans and examples of them can be found in the books of Wehman and Sailor.,12
452,A guide or point of reference,12
453,the variety and confusion of possibilities and responsibilities after the compulsory school period the need for a guide has been widely recognised by young people and their families.,12
454,In a study published by OECD/CERI a number of examples are given (OECD 1990b).,12
455,One which has received considerable attention is the Kurator system in Denmark.,12
456,A Kurator is similar to a specialist careers teacher with additional contributions to make after school.,12
457,The Kurator is a member of the school psychologist's team who teaches children with special educational needs and is responsible for their careers education and work experience.,12
458,He or she has a number of non-teaching hours for work with young people and their families after they leave school.,12
459,The time available and balance of the Kurator's work may vary from one municipality to another.,12
460,Support can be offered for four years after school.,12
461,The Kurator is a facilitator who works on request with young people and their families.,12
462,Supported employment,12
463,"One of the most significant developments has been the increasing open employment of young people with severe disabilities, particularly severe intellectual disabilities.",12
464,Research in the United States has shown the inadequacy of the sheltered workshop model where commercial objectives limit access for those with severe disabilities and where transfer to open employment is very limited.,12
465,Supported open employment is much more successful.,12
466,The Genoa approach is  one identified by the OECD but there are others in the United States.,12
467,The importance of the Genoa experience is that it has the backing of employers and trade union organisations.,12
468,Young people are placed in open employment and trained and supported by social service teams.,12
469,Salary is paid by the province or state for the first year after which the employer accepts responsibility.,12
470,Support teams work with employers and fellow workers in a training programme and are also on call if there are problems.,12
471,Results are impressive.,12
472,In a city with 12 unemployment 300 recent placements have resulted in an over 90 job retention rate after the first three years of employment.,12
473,THE ROLE OF POST-SCHOOL EDUCATION,12
474,It is important that those concerned with post-school education for young people with disabilities and learning difficulties are informed about the context in which they work and have a grasp of the essential features of transition.,12
475,They also need to be conversant with the main developments taking place in further and continuing education.,12
476,"Many of the features of effective special education, individual programmes and the management of a wide variety of learning rates and styles, are now expected in the mainstream of education and training — , work in the Teaching and Vocational Educational Initiative.",12
477,The labour market will need to make effective use of the smaller groups leaving school.,12
478,"To increase the labour force will require that the potential of minority groups, including those with disabilities and learning difficulties, is recognised and that appropriate training and support for them is made available.",12
479,The possible introduction of individual education and training vouchers for school leavers will also provide education and training with a new challenge.,12
480,"Unless the youth group has adequate guidance and counselling, individuals may find choice difficult.",12
481,Vouchers may also limit the opportunities of those with special needs unless their value is enhanced to make provision of good-quality training attractive.,12
482,A recognition that education post-school is a shared responsibility is vital.,12
483,"Parents, social workers and other carers have an educational role as do vocational training staff, employers and employees.",12
484,This means that lecturers and tutors should work with them to develop programmes and curricula.,12
485,"But, above all, responsibility must be shared with the young person.",12
486,"The development of self-presentation, self-advocacy and of self-directed learning should all be central features of this phase of education.",12
487,Supporters of those with special needs should be exemplars of such good practice.,12
488,"Developments of this kind have been initiated and sustained, in recent years, by the Further Education Unit.",12
489,"Its publications (FEU 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990c) are an important source of guidance and good practice.",12
490,CONCLUSIONS,12
491,Post-school education for young people with disabilities and learning difficulties has had to be fought for.,12
492,In the past the case has been based on the wish to delay in unstimulated life it home or admission to a training centre.,12
493,"Now the grounds are more positive, namely the right to be considered for employment and as a contributor to the economy.",12
494,"For the individual, employment may represent the most potent symbol of adult status and integration into the community.",12
495,What is being sought by many is equality of opportunity and access.,12
496,"However, there are also positive grounds for governments to invest in education and training for independence and employment.",12
497,Research in Scandinavia and the United States has identified the cost of lifelong dependent care for those with disabilities as something developed economies cannot sustain in the future.,12
498,"Only by enabling those with disabilities to contribute, if they wish, through independent living and paid employment, will the increased percentage of ageing people be able to receive the support they expect and need.",12
499,"Thus, the charity image of disability must disappear.",12
500,Higher expectations and effective post-school education for those who have received special education in school is not a luxury but an economic necessity.,12
501,The form that post-school education should take is a matter for major discussion beyond the scope of this review.,12
502,The rhetoric and reality of transition to adult life,12
503,Jenny Corbett and Len Barton,12
504,In this chapter Jenny Corbett and Len Barton take a critical look at the concept of ‘transition into adult life’ for young people with disabilities and those categorised as having learning difficulties.,12
505,They argue that the barriers to participation which exist in society should be given greater recognition.,12
506,They discuss the approaches and difficulties encountered in further education and youth training.,12
507,"They describe a reality in which pressures to exclude and marginalise young people with disabilities or those categorised as having learning difficulties, are still very strong.",12
508,INTRODUCTION,12
509,This chapter examines the currently popular notion of ‘transition to adulthood’ to illustrate the complex and contentious nature of integration into adult life.,12
510,"It is a process of transition which all young people have to pass through but which is experienced differently as a result of such key factors as class, race, gender and disability (Cross and Smith 1987, Griffin 1985, Willis 1977).",12
511,Integration into adult life is constricted within social and economic boundaries.,12
512,"‘Transition to adulthood’ involves a wide diversity of progressions beyond school into further education, training programmes, employment and community living.",12
513,"The extent to which individuals are able to participate in employment, leisure and social interaction, , will be an indicator of the reality of their ‘adulthood’.",12
514,This broad view offers a wider concept of ‘integration’ than the narrow educational framework which predominantly confines debate in this area.,12
515,It also places ‘transition’ in a political arena in which the tensions between rhetoric and reality are highlighted.,12
516,We are concerned to challenge the extent to which those involved in this restricted form of transition are offered any real choices in decision-making.,12
517,CONCEPTIONS OF ‘TRANSITION',12
518,A failure to address the nature of the society into which integration is being advocated reveals the fundamental weakness and inadequacy of much of the  literature dealing with this issue.,12
519,"If integration is seen merely as a response to individual needs, then the unequal, offensive and divisive nature of society remains unchallenged.",12
520,"Given the degree and stubbornness of such inequalities, the topics that concern us are those of power, choice, entitlement and social justice: issues of rights, not needs.",12
521,"The question of how to empower those people marginalised through disabilities and learning difficulties is, thus, a central one.",12
522,Government documents and official statements concerning integration are replete with romantic and ill-defined language.,12
523,"The Warnock Report, , contends that there is a",12
524,"widely held and still growing conviction that, so far as is humanly possible, handicapped people should share the opportunities for self-fulfilment enjoyed by other people.",12
525,(DES 1978: 99),12
526,and the Council of Europe's Report on states that:,12
527,The integration of mentally disabled people into society means that persons with mental handicaps of any degree should be able to live as normal a life as possible.,12
528,(Council of Europe 1986: 9),12
529,"just as with these statements about integration, an unchallenged view of ‘normality’ is subsumed within the rhetoric of ‘adulthood’.",12
530,"Adulthood is, thus, largely perceived in consensual terms with the emphasis being upon enabling the individual to be ‘as normal as possible’.",12
531,‘Normality’ is a nebulous concept unless we ask whose normality is to be valued and emulated?,12
532,"As it is professionals who generally define what they regard as ‘normality’, this allows limited scope to negotiate flexible boundaries to accommodate a range of perspectives.",12
533,Abberley (1989) argues that the specific form of normality being advocated becomes disabling in itself as it inhibits expressions of difference.,12
534,"He claims, moreover, that such a view is",12
535,"not only profoundly mistaken the source and nature of the multiple disadvantages experienced by disabled people, but that its propagation, in the context of modern Britain, serves not to combat but to perpetuate the oppression of disabled people.",12
536,(Abberley 1989: 56),12
537,The argument of achieving ‘self-fulfilment’ and of ‘living as normal a life as possible’is seriously flawed when set against the context of an environment that is essentially oppressive and unadaptive and in which professional power establishes and perpetuates patterns of dependency.,12
538,Opportunities for meaningful decision-making marginalised groups are largely cosmetic.,12
539,"Barnes (1990) made a recent study of the role of day  centres for disabled young people, in which few opportunities were offered for significant decision-making despite the operation of ostensibly progressive policies.",12
540,This research illuminated the contradictions of a transition from passive schooling to day centre provision.,12
541,"Where young people were not used to making independent decisions and had become conditioned by special education, they found this move into a more adult environment difficult to adjust to.",12
542,Staff encouraged debate but these users,12
543, to have little interest in the sort of discussion groups generally seen as furthering mutual support and understanding…,12
544,"The more able in the group felt they ‘couldn't tell us anything we don't already know’ or they were ‘depressing’, while the remainder said that they did not like them because they made them feel inadequate.",12
545,(Barnes 1990: 136),12
546,It is not only the limitations of the day centre model of care but also the legacy of segregated schooling which makes taking over control so difficult.,12
547,‘Transition to adulthood’ suggests a journey to a substantive destination to which we all travel.,12
548,"However, the real passage which most of us experience is unpredictable and irregular.",12
549,Griffiths argues that,12
550,Adulthood is not recognised as a single event evident to everyone.,12
551,"Instead, a number of small changes in status and recognitions of the progress towards adult status takes place over a number of years.",12
552,(Griffiths 1989: 5),12
553,There is not one form of adult status but a hierarchy which reflects the way in which society values different groups.,12
554,"for those at the lowest levels, the quality of this transition places them in a severely restricted form of ‘adulthood’.",12
555,"For an increasing number of young people, ‘transition’ is into vagrancy.",12
556,"Recent research has illustrated that the raising of the minimum age of entitlement for Income Support in 1988 has forced young people to be dependent on their families and has inhibited their transition to adulthood (Harris 1988, Whynes and ferris 1990).",12
557,"The majority of those young people who leave home to live rough are found not to have chosen this course but, rather, to have had it thrust upon them by circumstances.",12
558,Hostels which offer short-term care for the young homeless find their clients are usually the most vulnerable and difficult (Hutton and Liddiard 1990).,12
559,This form of ‘transition’ from residential care or the family into homelessness can instil a sense of despair and dependency which becomes habitual.,12
560,"Wallace and Cross (1990) suggest that young people in the 1990s are setters of trends but ‘have become to some objects of pity and concern’(Wallace and Cross 1990: 7), more vulnerable and dependent than in the recent past.",12
561,TRANSITION THROUGH FURTHER EDUCATION,12
562,The whole concept of ‘transition To adulthood’ is problematic.,12
563,"The period affects all young people and involves a series of stages over a number of years, which are influenced by social and economic status.",12
564,Yet for some it appears to form the focus of their curriculum.,12
565,The curriculum for most young people who have left school involves academic or vocational courses which prepare them for specific adult roles.,12
566,"By contrast, a curriculum for young people with disabilities or learning difficulties often centres around a ‘preparation for adulthood’ this constitutes a recognisable area of study.",12
567,"In the curriculum framework for students with severe disabilities called , Hutchinson and Tennyson (1986) acknowledge that, despite the title of their curriculum and their aim of extending choice, their actual capacity to change current opportunities for students on completion of the programme is negligible.",12
568,"Thus, the rhetoric of choice and entitlement is met by the reality of devalued citizenship.",12
569,The language of such curricula denies the real economic and cultural oppression experienced by disabled people.,12
570,Yet Hutchinson and Tennyson are well aware of the frustrations facing their students and seek to combat them:,12
571,Jealousy and resentment between the different agencies involved with disabled people are often deeply entrenched and extremely difficult to break down.,12
572,‘Who pays for what’ often results in essential facilities or care being postponed or withheld indefinitely whilst the ‘professionals’argue the case amongst themselves.,12
573,"Alternatively, in the present economic climate, the power relationships between the different agencies may result in professionals vying to serve the needs of prospective clients since they have vested interests in defining the needs of their clients and expanding the numbers they serve to safeguard their own jobs.",12
574,"It is all too easy for this system to lead to a ‘disabling’ an ‘enabling’context for students' adult lives, thus negating the benefits of a college-based ‘Transition to Adulthood’course.",12
575,(Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 68 — 9),12
576,The authors go on to offer examples of students whose transition from college has been one of experiencing limited choice and often unsuitable placements.,12
577,They even suggest that,12
578,Such problems lead us to question the purpose of a ‘Transition to Adulthood’ course.,12
579,It is felt that much of the progress students make whilst in college will be lost if they are not able to go on to meet fresh demands in new situations.,12
580,(Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 72),12
581,"If this form of ‘transition’ becomes simply a retrograde return to passivity, it can be seen as a complete negation of all that the college course sought to encourage:",12
582,"Indeed, it has been said by some professionals in the field that we are doing the students a disservice by attempting to break through their apathy since their main chance of happiness lies in their passive acceptance of traditional ‘care’ facilities.",12
583,"Naturally, we as a staff find this attitude totally unacceptable.",12
584,If nothing else we hope that by attending college the students will have gained the confidence and determination to go out into the community and demand that changes be made.,12
585,(Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 72),12
586,"Within this framework, ‘transition’ becomes a new form of responsibility and awareness, a way of viewing the situation.",12
587,A common practice of ‘transition’ is that from special school to college of further education.,12
588,"Despite a commitment to curriculum entitlement (FEU 1989), institutions have commonly narrowed opportunities by the provision of separate courses or by restricting the participation of disabled students in a full range of general education classes.",12
589,"Social and life skills classes have often been created with the overt intention of facilitating the integration of students with disabilities (Dee 1988), yet they may lack certification and have low academic status.",12
590,"Although notions of autonomy and self-advocacy are central to many courses, there is evident tension between the aims tutors and the constraints imposed by parents and post-college opportunities (Dee 1988, Wertheimer 1989).",12
591,Such ‘ghettoisation’ is supported by the familiar practice of transferring special school staff and a skills-based curriculum into special needs departments in colleges.,12
592,"A move towards student autonomy might be seen in an increasing emphasis upon the value of students entering into negotiation about their individual programmes, including the assessment process.",12
593,"However, Major (1990) argues that inequalities of power between student and teacher mitigate against any real negotiation.",12
594,"fay (1988) also argues that ‘negotiating’ with students can be personally intrusive and involve a hidden assessment of ‘qualities ‘willingness’, ‘drive’, ‘reliability’and even ‘self-awareness’(fay 1988: 27).",12
595,Fay contends that such activities ‘colonise private space’(Fay 1988: 27).,12
596,An invasion of privacy into the lives of vulnerable individuals is masked by the rhetoric of empowerment with the implication that it is being ‘done with to trainees’(fay 1988: 26).,12
597,TRANSITION TO YOUTH TRAINING,12
598,Another aspect of transition is that from school to youth training.,12
599,"This offers programmes in vocational areas carpentry, office skills, catering, hairdressing, building, word processing, banking, sport and the arts.",12
600,"These programmes are of two main kinds: the one based with employers offering the most favourable route to jobs; the other, workshop-based, simulating employment and with implications of unemployability.",12
601,Hollands (1990) illustrates the  way in which young people themselves challenge aspects of the training programmes:,12
602,Some young people refuse to accept that they are deficient in the skills and cultures necessary for many working-class jobs.,12
603,"As such, they often see through life and social skills training and develop common-sense critiques of the curriculum.",12
604,(Hollands 1990: 73),12
605,"In supporting a transition to adulthood, how does youth training differentiate between groups of young people? for some young Black trainees, disproportionately represented in workshop-based schemes, the programmes serve to shape them into acceptable employees within a market which discriminates against them and to ease them gently their aspirations into the reality of restricted choice (Corbett 1990).",12
606,"As this liaison officer recognised, the basic level of skills training equipped them only for unskilled work and they had to learn to cope with compromise:",12
607,"even if we get a young person coming the workshops that may not be the best electrician going, we can find them something in a related area — an electrical warehouse, where their knowledge of the bits that they know will be put to good use and they'll still be in that environment they want to work in.",12
608,"(Liaison Officer 1988, in Corbett 1990: 97)",12
609,This ‘transition’ is one of learning where you fit into society one of practising choice.,12
610,‘Life skills’ training supports this delicate process:,12
611,"Perhaps, not surprisingly, in a short space of time life skills training has become detached from the wider objectives associated with liberal humanist education: the point being that teaching young people society has been replaced by criteria designed to alter their with it.",12
612,(Gleeson 1990: 188),12
613,"Youth training can act as a form of ‘moral rescue’ from the penalty of unemployment, in which trainees perceive their transition into training itself as a form of moral superiority:",12
614,"George, a former school truant and now a construction trainee, said: ‘I did something…but the others, you saw them at school, just lazy.’",12
615,Others spoke of their gratitude to YTS and how it ‘worked for me’.,12
616,It was in this way that YTS helped to sustain an individualistic and divisive work ethic.,12
617,(Lee .,12
618,1990: 133),12
619,"Within this work ethic, girls are encouraged to accept tasks in Youth Training Scheme (YTS) institutional care programmes which prepare them for often  distasteful and uncomfortable future roles as unskilled care staff (Bates 1991).",12
620,"In exploring the ways in which young people are guided into employment, Bates recognises that.",12
621,Young people do not ‘go gently’ into employment.,12
622,The work required to bring them there is not a bloodless operation.,12
623,(Bates 1991: 1),12
624,"For some young people, especially those in areas of high youth unemployment who are attending special youth training programmes for trainees with learning difficulties, this operation may never succeed in bringing them into employment (Wilkinson 1990).",12
625,Transition through training is shown to be a process in which vulnerable young people are stratified into the slots allotted to them being engaged in real decision-making about future choices.,12
626,CONCLUDING REMARKS,12
627,Transition is shaped by different opportunities and experiences and is a development which highlights inequalities.,12
628,"for some young people with disabilities which require a high level of care, this stage can be one of experiencing frustration in the limits of housing provision and support services (Fiedler 1989).",12
629,Their ‘transition’ may be no more than being found a placement in residential care after the completion of an independence training college course (Corbett 1991).,12
630,The reality of their adulthood may include exclusion from the labour market (Oliver 1989).,12
631,"If they are fortunate enough to become involved in an initiative which supports their progress into employment, this can lead them into another level of experience.",12
632,Newman (1990) described a young man with cerebral palsy employed as a council clerical officer on a Sheltered placement Scheme.,12
633,He was assessed as only able to work at 50 of the rate for the job and only half his wages were paid under the scheme.,12
634,"As it turned out, his skills on the job have led to the department trying to regrade him into a more demanding post.",12
635,"Without initial support, this transition would have been impractical.",12
636,"Class, race and gender differences can determine the quality of transition what training is provided and where it leads.",12
637,"The level of support which young people receive from parents and mentors will also have a significant effect upon the process of transition, for it is a stage in which their dependency is visibly apparent.",12
638,The rise in youth homelessness is a testimony to the need for consistent support during this vulnerable period.,12
639,Much of the rhetoric of ‘transition’ fails to recognise the complexity of the social world.,12
640,It is only within this complexity that ‘transition to adulthood’ can be understood.,12
641,Supporting special needs in further education,12
642,Maureen Turnham,12
643,Since 1983 Maureen Turnham has been a lecturer in a college of further education with responsibility for a group of students categorised as having severe learning difficulties who are on a ‘life-preparation’ course at her college.,12
644,"In this chapter she discusses her preconceptions and first impressions of further education, then describes her own and her students' experience of their course and their attempts to participate with other students in the life of the college.",12
645,She questions the selection procedures for students with difficulties and disabilities and discusses the barriers to participation posed by the arrangement of the buildings and people's attitudes.,12
646,She reviews her own changing perceptions a commitment to equality of opportunity for all learners.,12
647,IMPRESSIONS OF FURTHER EDUCATION,12
648,My mother saw it.,12
649,My colleague saw it and cut it out for me.,12
650,I didn't see it but when I was presented with the job advert from a local newspaper the words leapt out at me: ‘Lecturer: Special needs’ in the college in the borough where I used to teach before becoming a peripatetic home teacher for pre-school children.,12
651,Lecturer!,12
652,"I remember, several weeks after my successful interview, discussing my impending change of job at a party with a neighbour who works at the local university.",12
653,"My quizzing about the intellectual world which I was about to enter with some trepidation left him with a wry smile, which puzzled me for some time after, as my naïvety about the world of further education lasted well into my early days in college.",12
654,"My initial perceptions of a college of further education might have begun on a lofty plane, but I was soon brought down to earth with a bump.",12
655,"Upon being introduced by the special needs coordinator as the new tutor to a group of students with severe learning difficulties, I heard several groans of ‘Oh no, we thought we'd got rid of you…’.",12
656,"Several of my ex-pupils, some of whom I'd first taught when they were 7 years old, grimaced at me as they carried on preparing their lunch.",12
657,They had made the transition to college ‘inhabitants’ in the two years since I had left the borough.,12
658,It was to take me some time longer to undergo the metamorphosis from a ‘teacher’ to a ‘lecturer’.,12
659,Some of that initial group of  students and myself already had known for several years and knew 's families.,12
660,"They all knew my younger sister, .",12
661,"She went to a special school, and continued to be a voluntary helper at the school where I taught when I left.",12
662,"Some first impressions and, early experiences of college life remain clearly in my mind — what was this new world where the academic staff all taught, but many of them were not ‘teachers’ like me but engineers or nurses or painters and decorators?",12
663,"My knowledge of the history of further education, and of how my college had evolved from a county technical college, was scant.",12
664,I was thrown into a jungle of new jargon.,12
665,"The language of special education had long been tucked under my belt, but now I was faced with filling in timetables with terms ‘DD’ time — departmental duties, to the uninitiated — in other words, time when I was not actually in direct teaching contact with students.",12
666,College induction programmes for staff new to FE were in their infancy at that time and I probably felt content in the knowledge of my own ‘expertise’.,12
667,"After all, I had nine years' experience in special education.",12
668,"Surely, further education could not be so different?",12
669,THE DEVELOPING ‘SPECIAL NEEDS’ PROVISION,12
670,"Seven years later, my experience of further education has grown and my perceptions of it have inevitably changed.",12
671,"Our college's initial provision for ‘students with special needs’ was established in 1978 — a ‘discrete’course for students with moderate learning difficulties or, in some instances, school leavers from high schools who needed extra support before joining training schemes.",12
672,"The lecturer appointed to teach the students, who was later to become the college's special needs coordinator, once told me about those early beginnings as ‘part of the Engineering Department, based in a hut on the field’.",12
673,"For a long time I assumed she was joking, but not only was I wrong, I was also ignorant of the hard facts of life about the value of students with special needs and the staff who work with them.",12
674,"Talking to colleagues from other establishments at a conference some years later, I was struck by the similarities in their early beginnings — often in a portacabin or separate annexe from the main college building, or in accommodation previously occupied by a school.",12
675,"Stories of inferior accommodation, equipment and materials, effectively deemed to be ‘good enough’ for students with special needs, seemed to far outweigh reports of a stated commitment for those students being backed up by provision that was dignified and appropriate.",12
676,The life preparation course,12
677,In 1983 we began to provide a course for students with severe learning difficulties.,12
678,"This provision was established as a result of several pressures, not least of  all parental lobbying for an alternative option to adult training centres.",12
679,For many young adults with severe learning difficulties this was not much more than a decade after they became ‘entitled’ to full-time education.,12
680,"A former school for children with severe learning difficulties, a single-storey building three miles from the main site, therefore became a college annexe.",12
681,"It began as, and has remained, the base for nursery nurse students and for ‘life preparation’ students (referred to not as ‘special needs’students but prefixed by the title of the course they are following — the same as other students!).",12
682,"The building also houses the relevant staff, including the senior lecturer who is the college's special needs coordinator.",12
683,Opportunities for the integration of students were present from the beginning.,12
684,", there is a shared student common room, shared toilet facilities for all students (there is one adapted toilet/bathroom), and equal access to facilities the juke box (donated by the Students' Union, but removed when it failed to show a profit!) and the vending machines.",12
685,"The annexe has few refectory facilities, and on some days it seems that the queue for the coffee machine snakes endlessly around the corridors.",12
686,"During queuing periods, there have been occasions when I have witnessed nursery nurse students, with the best of intentions, ‘helping’ life preparation students, by operating the machine for them or by ‘allowing’them to jump the queue.",12
687,"I have to admit that, in the early days, it was with mixed feelings that I intervened — suggesting, , that life preparation students really ought to take their turn the same as anyone else.",12
688,"The mixed feelings were, perhaps, cowardly on my part.",12
689,"While I saw no justification for positive discrimination in the coffee queue, I was aware that prejudice can stem from the most unexpected beginnings.",12
690,"Something as innocuous as suggesting to another student that a life preparation student should be allowed to take the coins her purse unaided may, inadvertently, upset the nursery nurse student in the short term.",12
691,"However, in the long term, I feel sure that continuing input (both formal and informal) into initial nursery nurse training can only serve to extend students' knowledge about the nature and implications of severe learning difficulties.",12
692,How nursery nurses and other students choose to use this knowledge is another matter entirely.,12
693,Joint craft,12
694,"Conscious of our lack of truly integrated teaching sessions, and freshly inspired by a successful ‘joint’ activity weekend at a local Outward Bound Centre, we made plans to change the structure of one particular curriculum area.",12
695,"It was decided that a double staffed session of craft, with one group of life preparation students and one group of nursery nurse students would be on the timetable once a week.",12
696,"The nursery nurses were initially given a talk on the nature of what was, in essence, a pilot scheme for functional integration.",12
697,"It was explained that it was hoped that they would ‘befriend’ a life preparation student for craft sessions, working alongside on a variety of projects.",12
698,"The projects were pitched at different levels, in the strictest sense the students were working in a parallel fashion.",12
699,"Although this pilot was not monitored formally, it was hailed by participating students and staff as an unreserved success, generating a substantial commitment to equality for students with severe learning difficulties, and a sound knowledge, on a practical level, of many of their needs.",12
700,One unexpected spin-off was the growth of a few genuine friendships.,12
701,The increase in confidence in many of the life preparation students was another benefit.,12
702,"Flushed with success we repeated this timetabled session, with the original members of staff, the following year with different students.",12
703,The results were disappointing.,12
704,"With hindsight, there ‘rumblings’ from some nursery nurses during the early stages of the course, but the matter only came to a head when a small group of nursery nurses made a formal complaint to a course tutor.",12
705,They felt that they were ‘not getting on’ with their craft work or were ‘held back by the students with severe learning difficulties’.,12
706,The outcome was that a second room was negotiated and the students returned to the pattern of separate and segregated groups.,12
707,"During a further meeting about the problems, some of the nursery nurse staff expressed their concern over the attitude of this group of students.",12
708,They felt that their students are in the caring field and ‘ought naturally to empathise with students with severe learning difficulties’.,12
709,"I would question this, as I feel we are treading on dangerous ground if we even contemplate trying to impose our values in this way, however strongly we feel personally.",12
710,It seems obvious to me several factors involved could have been given more thought.,12
711,There could have been greater consultation with both nursery nurse and life preparation students and due consideration given to the fact that completed craft projects are an important part of a nursery nurse's final assessment.,12
712,"We now have an opportunity to benefit from lessons learned, as, during the past year, we have undertaken a pilot scheme to integrate life preparation students with Sports and Leisure students who are following a City and Guilds course.",12
713,Feeling established,12
714,Our life preparation student numbers have grown continually and encompassed students from outside the district as happens on other such courses.,12
715,This was partly because our college's provision for students with severe learning difficulties was being recommended by careers officers from other authorities.,12
716,A pat on the back!,12
717,It felt like confirmation that we had got it right.,12
718,This seemed to be further corroborated when we were invited to join the second phase of a research project being undertaken by the National Foundation for Educational Research and the Further Education Unit.,12
719,"Other colleagues working in schools or adult training centres from our authority were also asked to participate, as together we had previously set up a voluntary curriculum development group to look at authority-wide provision for young people and adults with severe learning difficulties.",12
720,This  group had met almost every week for nearly two years.,12
721,The national research project resulted in the publication of in early 1988 (Dee 1988).,12
722,Curriculum principles,12
723,"From the very beginnings of the ‘life preparation’ course, we tried to write an independence curriculum, and to follow the principles of ‘normalisation’.",12
724,Every opportunity to maximise the differences between school and college life was seized.,12
725,", the college day for life preparation students is the same length as for other students.",12
726,"The possibilities for integration, that do not exist in a segregated, all-age special school, are many — as students begin to mix, sometimes for the first time, in a community setting with other adult learners.",12
727,"The college environment may offer less ‘protection’ than their school, but it offers the chance to broaden horizons.",12
728,One example of this is in the chance to meet and work with non ‘special needs’ staff.,12
729,Students have the opportunity to join the college library and are encouraged to join the Students' Union.,12
730,"They are given a copy of their own group's timetable, they can read, and they are timetabled in a variety of rooms, with different tutors on two different sites.",12
731,"Travelling is done on public transport — we have a college minibus which tutors can book for residentials, visits and regular timetabled activities, the Leisure Centre.",12
732,Supervisory duties at break and lunch-time are carried out by non-teaching assistants.,12
733,", the staff/student ratio is rarely as good as in a school for children and young people with severe learning difficulties.",12
734,"However, as our special needs coordinator rightly emphasises ‘we are a college — not an extended special school’.",12
735,The whole ethos of a college of further education is different to that of a special school — from the funding and the staffing to the size and complexity of the sites.,12
736,We share the annexe base with nursery nurse students and staff.,12
737,"An early rule of thumb became ‘if the nursery nurses don't do it, neither do we’.",12
738,"We talked with our students about the freedoms of college life, and suggested that they might judge certain behaviour was ‘age appropriate’ by looking at the nursery nurses (incorrectly and naïvely assuming the latter would unfailingly provide the models we sought!).",12
739,"This mechanism ended in total failure when, after lengthy and various attempts to persuade several female life preparation students to give up wearing white ankle socks tights, short socks, mostly white, suddenly became very fashionable and seemed to adorn every other pair of ankles in the building.",12
740,"With hindsight, I question some of my early motives and certainly now see different ways of exploring choices with students.",12
741,"One route for beginning to make informed choices is through self-advocacy, where students are encouraged either to speak up for themselves or to use an advocate who speaks on their behalf.",12
742,"Self-advocacy complements ‘normalisation’ and it is an issue which, recently, staff have actively begun to promote.",12
743,The Open University's has generated much interest in this area (Open University 1989).,12
744,Selection procedures,12
745,", we select students for the life preparation course, following a baseline assessment devised by myself and colleagues which is carried out during a links week when potential students attend college full time.",12
746,"We didn't have interviews, but a young person had to ‘gain' a place , as we had criteria for entry onto the course.",12
747,I suppose I felt that this fitted in neatly with the selection process for other students.,12
748,"Also, we had no ‘medical’ back-up, as is often the case in special schools, therefore we felt unable to meet the needs of students with profound multiple disabilities.",12
749,"I can recall talking to Lesley Dee, ‘New Directions’ project leader, about her teaching experience in South Thames college and her approach to ‘FE for all’.",12
750,"When she spoke about learning difficulties or special needs she included everyone, even young people with severe ‘challenging behaviour’.",12
751,"This represented a very different target group to the one with which I was familiar, and it seemed an alien approach to me.",12
752,I was worried that it could dilute or blunt our provision.,12
753,I thought that it undermined the satisfaction of ‘getting a place in college’ for students with severe learning difficulties.,12
754,"However, I now realise that perhaps the only person who felt intimidated by ‘FE for all’ was me.",12
755,Our selection procedure has resulted in no places being offered to students with profound or multiple disabilities or severe challenging behaviour.,12
756,"Our selection procedure still exists, but I want to see it changed to one which is more equitable.",12
757,National reflections currently focus upon the need for college to be ‘responsive’ to ensure that individuals can gain access to the curriculum ‘regardless of any disability or special learning need they may have’(FEU 1990: 11).,12
758,"In considering the issue of entitlement to access, my college would be required to look at two groups of learners hitherto excluded — students with profound or multiple disabilities and students with challenging behaviour.",12
759,"The life preparation course, in its present form, is unlikely to meet their specific needs, but the curricular content could serve as a starting point for designing new provision which would.",12
760,The possible stumbling blocks would be financial and attitudinal barriers to these learners.,12
761,"It is my belief that our life preparation students are not ‘valued’ by many colleagues, so how would they react to learners seen to be ‘less able’or more difficult to cope with?",12
762,COUNTERING OBSTACLES TO INCLUSION,12
763,"There are a number of issues which still concern me about continuing education for students with disabilities, just as they did when I entered college life — , the fear and ignorance that often surrounds this seemingly homogeneous condition known as ‘disability’, and the unmitigated prejudice and stereotyping of people who do not ‘fit’ into a mythical category commonly  known as ‘normal’.",12
764,"However, I hope I am not so complacent that I am unable to acknowledge the difficulties of trying to bring about change.",12
765,It is a lengthy and wearing process.,12
766,"Attempting to challenge and change the attitudes of individuals who feel discomfort or exhibit prejudice when faced with the possibility, or reality, of encountering people with disabilities is both a responsibility in my job and intrinsic to my personality.",12
767,"I believe in the precept of ‘person first, disability second’.",12
768,"I believe that students with disabilities need to be valued as people, and any establishment that implies this on paper needs to put policy into practice.",12
769,"Our college, and authority, now has an equal opportunities policy document.",12
770,I am departmental representative on the Equal Opportunities Sub-committee.,12
771,"When the college policy and the sub-committee was first constituted, I was enthusiastic — teeth !",12
772,"Unfortunately, two years later, we are trying to rectify an original omission — the word ‘disability’ does not appear in the policy document.",12
773,"Unfortunately, it is not possible to just insert the word ‘disability’ into the document, as there are several procedures which must be adhered to, not least of all submission to the governors appointed since financial delegation some months ago.",12
774,I failed to realise for some considerable time the importance of commitment from the top down.,12
775,it was during some exchanges with colleagues from other establishments that I began to realise the significance of ‘who is on your side’.,12
776,"Senior management who truly support the right to continuing education for all learners are worth their weight in gold to lecturers who may be struggling to persuade colleagues, in their own department/school/division or otherwise, that students with special needs are entitled to be included in the further education system.",12
777,"Negative statements ‘I don't know how you can work with them’ or ‘they don't belong here — this is a college’, which were once like a red rag to a bull to me, insult or injure as they did.",12
778,"I have grown used to the fact that I will never ‘convert’ some colleagues however enthusiastic, persuasive or reasoned I am.",12
779,"I vociferously challenge those who insult; instead, I may casually invite them to come for a coffee and see/meet some students.",12
780,"Alternatively, if faced with a determined ‘It's not on…",12
781,"I/we are not trained/paid/ supposed to teach these students’, I do not launch into a tirade on equal opportunities but try to draw breath instead and substitute a concerned ear about the anxieties of dealing with students seen to be different.",12
782,"It's not always easy or straightforward, and I still have difficulty in dealing with such sweeping generalisations as: ‘he's a Down's Syndrome — they can be very stubborn, can't they?’; ‘mentally handicapped…they can be quite violent if they don't get their own way’.",12
783,"the danger in such misconceptions, the terminology used by some colleagues when referring to anyone with a disability can be disturbing.",12
784,"I refer to my students by name and would never refer to any of them as ‘a Down's Syndrome’, just as I would never refer to any of my friends who wear contact lenses as ‘a myopic’.",12
785,"Students with learning difficulties do encounter prejudice, and confronting prejudice is rarely an easy task.",12
786,"As a group, they are marginalised in a society that places a high value on being clever and articulate.",12
787,Within a large establishment a college it is unlikely that they will avoid some name-calling or jokes at their expense.,12
788,"We do have strategies that can be used — from advising the students with learning difficulties to ignore insults, to implementing the equal opportunities policy which finds such discrimination to be indefensible.",12
789,Questions of physical access,12
790,"The physical barriers to integration for students who have special needs will undoubtedly continue to pose problems in my own establishment, and those of colleagues, and are due, not least of all, to the ever-increasing constraints of finances.",12
791,"At the time of writing, plans to join two buildings with a walkway to improve access to the second building, which has no lift, have been scrapped.",12
792,"In the current financial climate, which sees us wrestling with colleges managing their own budgets and, in our own authority, reeling from the outcome of poll-capping, the expenses involved in improving physical access are likely to be competing with numerous other worthy but expensive causes.",12
793,Physical barriers to integration often receive much publicity.,12
794,"However, it is not good enough to assume that physical restrictions to access to college buildings can be removed, in one fell swoop, by the construction of a ramp or the fitting of a handrail.",12
795,"The ramp, , needs to be of the correct gradient, something which, in my experience of discussing such matters with colleagues, appears to be overlooked with alarming frequency!",12
796,"I discovered that, , one of our students was unable to propel her wheelchair up the ramped entrance to our annexe, a former special school building, without the dangerous likelihood of tipping backwards.",12
797,"A subsequent ramp built a fire exit one of the rooms was better, though the aforementioned student had long since left.",12
798,"Any ‘make do and mend’ philosophy which applies to facilities and provision for any group of learners, including students with disabilities, is regrettable and short-sighted.",12
799,Regrettable because it compounds a belief that there is a group of learners with lower status that the rest because they have been labelled as having ‘special needs’.,12
800,"Short-sighted because no amount of patchwork planning can be a substitute for a blueprint for services that has commitment, consultation and collaboration ingrained, like a name through candy rock.",12
801,THE FUTURE,12
802,"There are new developments ahead in FE, new funding arrangements, which I hope will not add to the difficulties of access for any student who may require specific support for learning.",12
803,There are also planned changes within community living which are likely to have significant implications as ‘different’ client groups ex-patients from long-stay hospitals move into the community.,12
804,"The need for a student-centred approach, perhaps not always present in some sectors of FE, is likely to become increasingly vital to tailoring programmes to meet the individual needs of those learners not traditionally seen as ‘student material’.",12
805,"Very recently, some of ‘our’ students have, like many of their peers, ‘voted with their feet’.",12
806,They did not turn up for sessions they considered boring and did not meet their needs.,12
807,"They are speaking up for themselves and expecting, rightly, that they will be listened to by staff and that their opinions will have the same validity as those of the next person.",12
808,"The current emphasis upon ‘empowerment’, and the belief that ‘the more self-empowered a person becomes, the more able he or she will be to enable others to be the same’(Fenton and Hughes 1989: 19), is effecting a shift in approach generally, and in my own personal practice, from a passive model of students.",12
809,My earlier justifications of an elitist selection procedure for our target group of students are incompatible with my commitment to equality of opportunity.,12
810,I obviously cannot swear allegiance to the principles of equal opportunities then justify the exclusion of some students purely the severity of their disability.,12
811,"However, the access route to our college for these students with additional difficulties seems likely to be long and winding, requiring commitment not only from staff myself, but also from those senior staff who are the policy-makers and who control the purse strings.",12
812,Many changes would need to be made to meet the needs of those learners.,12
813,"These are likely to range from an amendment to our current equal opportunities policy document (correcting the omission of ‘disability’) to a need to employ more staff, possibly from another discipline health.",12
814,"In a climate of radical spending cuts, the latter seems highly unlikely.",12
815,Putting theory into practice is simple.,12
816,"Nevertheless, my beliefs have changed over the last years and the message is clear: I think ‘further education for not quite all’ but of providing access to learning for everyone.",12
817,A hard journey in the right direction,12

819,Linda Shaw,12
820,"In this chapter, Linda Shaw describes her experiences of supporting Elizabeth and Helen in their South London flat — initially as a member of their team of workers and later as a friend.",12
821,Her knowledge of and friendship with the two women also enable her to describe what life was like from their point of view.,12
822,Elizabeth and Helen were living in the community after many years in an institution for people classified as ‘mentally handicapped’.,12
823,"Linda describes the details of their daily lives, the problems that arose in trying to set up a network of support that was sufficient, stable and yet not undermining of the women's growing independence, and the different reactions of Elizabeth and Helen to their new life.",12
824,"Despite the difficulties and the continuing insecurity of support, Linda concludes that life for Elizabeth and Helen has been improved by their time in the community and that the hard journey is worth it.",12
825,INTRODUCTION,12
826,Elizabeth and Helen moved into their own basement flat in an inner-city suburb in 1987. they are middle-aged and spent nearly thirty years together at the same mental handicap hospital but lived separately for the two years before the move into the community because Helen was transferred to a smaller institution.,12
827,The move was part of the ‘community care’ initiative adopted by health authorities to provide housing and support services in ordinary settings for people with learning difficulties.,12
828,"I was a member of the health service team supporting Elizabeth and Helen at the time of the move and I have stayed them since, as a friend and advocate.",12
829,"I have written this account on their behalf, based on my knowledge of the women, observations of their lifestyle, and discussions with them and their support workers.",12
830,The women's real names and some details about their lives have been disguised to protect their privacy.,12
831,STARTING AN ORDINARY LIFE,12
832,"two years after the move from institution to ordinary housing, Elizabeth and Helen are still learning about community living and adjusting to its demands and possibilities.",12
833,"The women's days are beginning to include the mix of activities, experiences and relationships which make up ordinary life for most people.",12
834,Their daily routines are starting to reflect their preferences and abilities and to include a level of personal responsibility.,12
835,"having to adapt to major changes in their status, environment, lifestyle and relationships, Elizabeth and Helen have to cope with the adjustments made by the people on whom they depend.",12
836,Health service staff and managers are still developing the new skills and the framework necessary to offer a quality community care service.,12
837,"Neighbours and business people, many of whom are confronting disability for the first time, have yet to work out ways of behaving with respect towards them and ways of making links which are welcome and helpful.",12
838,The women's long separation from the mainstream means that increasing their participation in ordinary life is an inevitable learning process for everybody involved.,12
839,The realisation that the transition from exclusion to inclusion is a slow manoeuvre and that community care evolves happens became clear soon after Elizabeth and Helen arrived at their new home.,12
840,"The first few months of life in the community were dominated by support workers' sense of heavy responsibility about the twin tasks of meeting the women's physical and medical needs and, at the same time, enabling them to be as independent as possible.",12
841,One member of the staff team of nine had nursing training; two had been teachers and the rest were from a variety of other backgrounds.,12
842,"The balance between doing too much and doing too little for Elizabeth and Helen, who both use wheelchairs, had to be continuously readjusted.",12
843,"Staff received basic instructions, but the appropriate ways to help each woman with personal care, diet and medication (for epilepsy) had to be worked out through discussion with the helpers.",12
844,From the beginning of her tenancy Helen took pride in having a home of her own.,12
845,She coped well with the change-over and immediately welcomed any opportunity to take part in household activities.,12
846,"‘It's my job’, is her prompt response to any attempt to take over tasks she wants to do herself.",12
847,"Helen's ability to enjoy herself and express her objections effectively make her an easy person to help, although she is sometimes criticised for being demanding.",12
848,Elizabeth found the move to community living much more difficult.,12
849,"On many occasions during those first few months, she was moody, tearful and uncommunicative.",12
850,"At the worst times she refused to leave her armchair in the lounge all day and occasionally overnight, saying she was too frightened to go to bed or to the bathroom.",12
851,"She cut herself off from comfort by clenching her fists, screaming and occasionally kicking when people approached.",12
852,"She was also frightened of doing housework and passed on jobs to a support worker, announcing: ‘She can do it.’",12
853,professional advice about Elizabeth's unhappiness  was that she was in a state of ‘mourning’ and that time would improve matters.,12
854,"In those early stages, support workers, who were highly motivated to give Elizabeth and Helen a ‘better life’, felt that the demands of the women's physical needs, together with Elizabeth's state of mind, undermined hopes for their social progress.",12
855,The basic business of looking after them felt so demanding and emotionally wearing that there seemed little rime left to introduce them to ‘real living’.,12
856,WIDENING HORIZONS,12
857,"Looking back, there's no doubt that we were too impatient and were unprepared for the major impact of the change from institution to community care on all concerned.",12
858,"As the third anniversary of the women's arrival in the community approaches, there is a marked improvement in Elizabeth's sense of well-being and greater participation by both women in activities beyond domestic and care routines.",12
859,"The women may spend large parts of the day on personal care, preparing and clearing up after meals and doing their laundry.",12
860,They have to overcome difficulties to accomplish these tasks so the amount of time involved increases the more the women participate and the less support workers take over.,12
861,"Although lengthy domestic and care routines are to some extent a reality of disability, it is necessary to work out a level of sharing between the women and their staff which allows a varied day and does not make a drudge anybody.",12
862,"A typical day for Elizabeth and Helen includes the usual range of personal and domestic tasks involved in looking after themselves and their flat with support, together with popular leisure activities watching television and listening to music.",12
863,Helen may do some painting and Elizabeth likes to work at drawing shapes and picking out words as first steps in reading and writing.,12
864,Some form of keep fit exercises or dancing in the flat is a feature on most days as are trips out to pursue activities their developing social programme.,12
865,"Such social activities as going to adult education classes, taking trips out in their car, going to church, visiting friends and being visited, now happen on a more regular basis.",12
866,"Around the time I was compiling this report the women attended three adult education classes a week — for music, keep-fit and self-advocacy.",12
867,"They had recently been on separate holidays, met support workers' families at their homes, danced at a party and had their photographs taken cuddling the few weeks' old daughter of a woman Elizabeth met at church.",12
868,A trip to London was planned and they were expecting two visits — one from an elderly relative who'd been in touch after receiving a holiday postcard and another from two people who used to live in the flat upstairs and had telephoned asking if they could call by.,12
869,"Elizabeth compiled the following list, with support, of what she likes about living in her own home.",12
870,Helen.,12
871,Going out.,12
872,Likes seeing Linda.,12
873,Likes the workers.,12
874,my car.,12
875,Going to church.,12
876,Having visitors.,12
877,Having a fish tank.,12
878,Elizabeth was also asked if she would like to make a list of what she does not like about community living but could not think of anything for the moment.,12
879,"She says that in the future, her current activities, she wants to learn to read and write and to plant flowers in the garden.",12
880,She does not want to do housework.,12
881,"Helen is not interested in making lists about her life, preferring to talk about the more immediate experiences of her recent holiday and birthday.",12
882,Her speech is not easy to understand but she effectively communicates her complete approval and enjoyment of the busy week when she went away.,12
883,"She'd been ‘everywhere’, she says, raising her arms and pointing in many different directions.",12
884,"She is an outgoing, cheerful person with an ability to communicate her feelings, to get along, and find enjoyment in most situations.",12
885,"She often opens conversations by telling people brightly: ‘I got up this morning’, which seems to reflect her talent for being delighted by what is deeply ordinary.",12
886,"Helen's main problems since she moved into her own home have been a period of illness, which caused her much discomfort, and a spate of difficulties in accepting personal care from temporary staff.",12
887,"Helen's personality does not seem to have altered significantly since her move into the community, although she has become more tolerant.",12
888,", she has simply become more herself; opportunities to participate have increased and she has responded to most of them enthusiastically.",12
889,"Elizabeth, on the other hand, has changed significantly.",12
890,For a start she looks different.,12
891,"She is slimmer and looks more of a woman, in clothes which are appropriate for her age.",12
892,"She slouches less in her wheelchair, raises her head more and looks at people in a more direct manner.",12
893,She says she does not like housework but she can manage some tasks.,12
894,She can count out and administer her own drugs and explain her own needs during visits to the doctor.,12
895,She is exceptionally good company when she is happy.,12
896,"She is curious and asks many questions about people and situations around her, including her own disabilities and difficulties.",12
897,"She works hard to understand issues which confuse her and is learning to be patient with herself when, as she puts it, her brain ‘gets stuck’.",12
898,She expresses much appreciation for what she considers beautiful and is beginning to show and receive affection.,12
899,How to tell when a person has become a friend is the latest of many difficult questions to which Elizabeth struggles to find answers.,12
900,Elizabeth is learning to speak up for herself.,12
901,"She says ‘no’ more often, suffering or withdrawing, and she is able to remind people of her difficulty in concentrating on one thing at a time.",12
902,I received a straightforward message recently when I telephoned her flat for a chat: ‘Elizabeth says she's busy.’,12
903,She is sorting out the conundrum of being a ‘high grade’ in hospital and a ‘person with a disability’in the community.,12
904,At times it surely is very difficult for her.,12
905,She still has periods of withdrawal and sadness but they are decreasing.,12
906,A SHAKY SUPPORT NETWORK,12
907,Community care for Elizabeth and Helen involves an extraordinary network of services which has yet to operate to full capacity and efficiency.,12
908,"Elizabeth and Helen have made progress despite the weakness and unpredictability of this shaky, official safety net.",12
909,It is a constant concern that they might have achieved much more if services had been better and that they may regress if services don't improve.,12
910,The women's direct support comes from a staff team working in twos at their flat during the day with one person sleeping overnight.,12
911,"Behind this front line is a complicated structure of health, social, housing and financial services, management and monitoring systems.",12
912,"During the first years of the women's life in the community, the full-time team of health authority support workers has been regularly understaffed, with temporary cover being provided by a private nursing agency.",12
913,None of the original team who were with the women at the time of the move still work at their flat.,12
914,"I left the team because the low pay would not cover the cost of my share in a mortgage to buy my own flat, and because I found it difficult to reconcile the separate roles of paid worker and friend, when Helen and Elizabeth recognised no such distinction.",12
915,I was sad to leave but felt that a turnover of paid staff was unavoidable with the present pay and conditions.,12
916,"I reassured myself that nothing could stop me keeping the women on a voluntary basis, provided they wished to remain friends.",12
917,The period during which I have been writing this chapter has seen one of the worst staffing levels ever at the women's flat.,12
918,At one stage half the permanent health service posts were unfilled and agency staff worked in the flat on a daily basis.,12
919,"The consortium responsible for looking after the women's housing and financial affairs, providing some monitoring of the quality of service, had temporarily to reduce its operations staff shortages.",12
920,"Members of the health authority team set up to give advice on the ‘physical, psychological, communication and mental health needs’ of people with learning difficulties are often difficult to contact when support workers want to discuss problems relating to the women.",12
921,"It is only recently that Elizabeth and Helen have had the benefit of a full-time manager whose job is to provide support, supervision and leadership to staff working in their home.",12
922,The effective operation of an Individual programme plan (IPP) for each woman is a major casualty of the haphazard delivery of services.,12
923,"The IPP is a system for mapping out individual goals, specifying means of achievement and assigning responsibility for progress.",12
924,"It is the most reliable method available for trying to ensure that the principles of community care policy agreed by the health authority — community presence, community participation, competence, respect and choice — are actually made available to the users of a service.",12
925,"The system aims to involve service users, and their friends and relatives, in planning individual lifestyles in the community, working out strategy and reviewing progress.",12
926,The written document produced in the process belongs to service users and provides them with necessary information to challenge service providers if they don't fulfil their contributions to the plan.,12
927,"The Individual Programme Plans of Elizabeth and Helen, which took two attempts to get off the ground staff changes and inadequate training, have been virtually suspended — even before the first reviews — the latest staffing upheaval.",12
928,Support staff who remain with the women worry increasingly about the lack of continuity.,12
929,"They are concerned that agency staff and new staff who don't know what the women have achieved will undermine progress, or even reverse it, by underestimating their capabilities.",12
930,"The lack of fully operational IPPs, which could have provided a safeguard against inconsistency, adds to workers' anxiety that Elizabeth and Helen are being let down.",12
931,"While the community care service sorts out its shortfalls, Elizabeth's enthusiasm to learn to read and write could be overtaken by boredom and depression.",12
932,Helen's frustration with people who don't appreciate her could result in a marked reduction in her tolerance level.,12
933,"one worker there had already been an occasion when she found Helen being ‘fed, wiped and pushed round the house’.",12
934,Support workers also worry about the effect of setbacks on the generally negative attitudes of many people in the community to people with learning difficulties.,12
935,"‘It's a vicious circle’, explained one worker.",12
936,"‘people with learning difficulties are not respected to begin with and because the women's Individual Programmes, including skills training, are not in place, they are not progressing as well as they could and they are not getting respect.’",12
937,"A senior manager agreed that staff shortages in the flat, planning and development for the women had taken second place to ‘keeping people afloat’.",12
938,When new staff were appointed development could move ahead again.,12
939,"Regarding community care in the authority the manager insisted, ‘We haven't got there yet, but we are certainly going in the right direction.’",12
940,Elizabeth and Helen express rather similar sentiments about their new way of life.,12
941,"‘It's ’, ‘I feel ’, they say.",12
942,"‘I'm happy’, ‘I'm settled’, ‘Now I know what it feels like’, ‘I got out on the right side’.",12
943,"They have not expressed any wish to return to living in an institution full time, although Helen occasionally likes to visit the hospital where she was a resident immediately before the move into the community.",12
944,"And while support staff are adamant about the need for  improvements in services and organisation, nobody believes the women would be better off returning to institutional care.",12
945,CONCLUSION,12
946,Elizabeth and Helen's initial experience of life in the community has brought them unhappiness and difficulties.,12
947,"There has also been much learning, laughter and warmth which has extended the enjoyment and understanding of everybody involved.",12
948,The new community care service has enabled the women to claim their places as citizens in their neighbourhood and take a tentative hold of a share in the goodness of ordinary life.,12
949,Opportunities have become available to them which would have been impossible in hospital.,12
950,"From the women's point of view, the need in the future is for a more reliable and responsive support network and a wider circle of friends and acquaintances to help them strengthen their hold on, and increase their share of, life in the community.",12

954,Chris Goodey,12
955,"In this chapter Chris Goodey reflects on the diagnosis, assessment and categorisation procedures employed by ‘professionals’: doctors, psychologists, teachers and administrators.",12
956,"He argues that such procedures and the decisions about a child's acceptability within mainstream education which may follow from them, are underpinned by competing philosophies about a child's acceptability as a human being.",12
957,"It is this philosophy, he argues, a body of technical knowledge, which drives the behaviour of professionals in their interactions with parents.",12
958,"He supports these contentions with the words of parents of children with trisomy 21 whose reactions to, and following, the birth of their children belie the simplified professional stereotypes which he sets beside them.",12
959,"He concludes by suggesting that membership of the group that accepts children with disabilities as full members of the human tribe, is open to all.",12
960,A HUMAN FAILING,12
961,What is it to be human?,12
962,The segregation of school pupils who have disabilities or learning difficulties poses this question immediately.,12
963,"Professionals segregate expert criteria, but ‘what is it to be human?’ sounds like a philosophical question — in which case it is also a political one — something for experts to decide.",12
964,"We as a group, defining ourselves as human, decide whom to include and whom to exclude as members of this group.",12
965,We do it when we decide what it is acceptable for people to be able or unable to do.,12
966,We do it when we decide that someone is unable to attend a school we have already described as ‘comprehensive’.,12
967,We do it when we decide that the sibling rule — that a child can attend the same school as a brother or sister — does not apply (the assumption here must surely be that siblings can belong to different species).,12
968,"Alongside the ideal common sense of the saying, ‘Nothing human is alien to me’, we operate the opposite principle too: nothing alien is human to me.",12
969,"In our own society we leave it to certain specialised people to decide, in practice, who is alien to the species and where the alien should be put.",12
970,"Expert classifications of disability and difficulty, and the apparatus of assessment that goes with them, appear to be scientifically objective.",12
971,But in fact this  appearance is only the distorted mirror-image of the reality I have described.,12
972,"We have already , more or less deliberately, whom we want to belong and whom not.",12
973,"We then criteria to back up the choice, delegating our responsibility to professional specialists.",12
974,The appearance of scientific objectivity is painted on afterwards.,12
975,"It gives credibility to the particular choice we as a self-defining ‘human’ group have made, and reinforces the validity of that choice by obscuring the fact that we make it voluntarily, have it imposed on us by scientific laws which are unquestionable and necessary.",12
976,"If it is all just a matter of philosophy, then anyone can voice an opinion on it, and there may be differing views of what ‘humanity’ consists of behind it all.",12
977,Philosophies clash and compete.,12
978,As far as those who experience difficulties in learning or have disabilities are concerned there are ‘excluders’ and ‘includers’.,12
979,"The excluders, since theirs is the prevailing view in our educational and other institutions, want to keep convincing the world that their choice who belongs is the only possible one.",12
980,This necessitates them saying something about the rival philosophy of the includers conveying the appearance of expertise.,12
981,"History has shown that the favourite way of dealing with any fundamental philosophy opposed to your own is to abuse its advocates as being fools and heretics — , to exclude the people their philosophy.",12
982,"The Catholic Church and the Soviet state under Stalin, , found ways of doing this to people who advocated different theological positions from the established one.",12
983,"In our case, the excluders want to keep out kinds of fool: people with learning difficulties themselves and their fool advocates, those people who represent the rival philosophy and advocate their inclusion.",12
984,Natural experts?,12
985,"The includers are not always merely disinterested advocates of a philosophy, but people who have become so through experience, through the sheer amount of time they spend with members of the excluded social group.",12
986,"‘parents’ are the best example, though not the only possible one.",12
987,I put the word in inverted commas to highlight a mystique about parenthood.,12
988,"There is no reason why having some coincidental sperm-and-egg relationship with a child should entitle someone for that reason to be seen as a ‘natural expert’, as distinct from a very clever, highly qualified one.",12
989,"But if criteria for inclusion and exclusion are not technical and professional but based on a philosophy about what human beings are, then parental expertise cannot be different in kind from that of professional (unnatural?) experts.",12
990,"As one of the parents in the interviews described later says, ‘When they say, you're the experts, parents are experts, what they really mean is — you get on with that little bit , and we'll get on with the really important stuff .’",12
991,"Conversely, , not all parents of children with disabilities see their children as members of the human species.",12
992,"Most parents, though, have a world-view which as you may expect does include ‘their’ children as fully paid-up members of the species.",12
993,"This observation  has occasionally even found its way into the specialist literature, but it is easy to miss its full significance.",12
994,"For parents, this world-view may not be ‘philosophical’ in the sense of something that is calculated, worked out and argued, though it can be and often is.",12
995,It is a way of life.,12
996,"Deny or threaten it, and you deny and threaten someone's existence.",12
997,"They will strive to validate it, and even prescribe it for you and everyone else: not just ‘this is how we live’, but ‘this is how one to live’.",12
998,"In the prevailing exclusionist literature, which is controlled by the professionally intelligent, the attitude that what professionals define as ‘intelligence’ does not matter, and that their child's humanity does, may be seen as a symptom of pathology as severe as (and similar to) a child's intellectual disabilities.",12
999,"It is a lack, a disqualification, an inability to face the reality of their child's disability.",12
1000,Because it is pathological it must not be allowed to appear in its own form.,12
1001,"To borrow from the classic language of the history of slavery, parents in this sense are ‘physically alive but socially dead’: we do not see them.",12
1002,"They contain endlessly frustrated plantation slaves who are rebellious at assessments and in encounters with professionals, but whose views only reach daylight in fragmented and unvalidated form; and they contain house slaves who agree with everything that goes on and use ‘massa's’ language and concepts, but who believe something else all the time and are waiting for the day.",12
1003,", they are a colonised people.",12
1004,"But other colonised people the Algerians under French rule described by Frantz Fanon or the Black Americans by Stokely Carmichael in the 1960s, they believe that they and their children should themselves be the civilising force to overcome the ‘civilisation’, the predominant philosophy and way of life, that has colonised them.",12
1005,"The stakes are high: it is not just a question of particular social groups (‘What is it to be Black?’,",12
1006,"‘What is it to be a woman?’), but of the very qualifications for inclusion in the human species.",12
1007,"They believe they have a different and better answer to the question, ‘What is it to be human?’",12
1008,WORDS OF EXPERIENCE: A RESEARCH PROJECT,12
1009,"My opening observations are not random reflections, but arise directly from a piece of research.",12
1010,Between 1987 and 1989 I conducted in-depth interviews with nearly forty parents of children with trisomy 21 (so-called Down's Syndrome) who were between the ages of 2 and 7.,12
1011,"I had several interviews with each parent individually, speaking to nearly 90 of the total population group in a borough with a wide class distribution and a large ethnic minority population (see Goodey 1991).",12
1012,Before I began the formal research I had been aware from the few parents of children with trisomy 21 I knew that there was more disquiet about their negotiations with professionals and the treatment of their children than had made its way into the academic and professional literature on parents and families.,12
1013,"Second, I also knew that this disquiet existed alongside other more conventional attitudes which perfectly fitted the portrayal of parents usually found in that literature.",12
1014,"After beginning to interview people in depth, I realised that, to explain this juxtaposition of apparently contradictory values within  individuals, I needed to go beyond the conceptual framework set by clinicians and sociologists alike.",12
1015,A shared language between parents and professionals did not necessarily mean shared attitudes.,12
1016,"It may be that when we express our opinions, we only have available to us ready-made sets of ideas, ‘discourses’, other people's words which we choose from, string together in different ways and think (mistakenly) to be our own; these include ‘expert’ ideas and the colloquial, common-sense versions of them absorbed by ordinary people in one way or another.",12
1017,"But we have something else too which is genuinely our own, we don't choose it, and that is experience.",12
1018,"It became clear from talking to parents that I had to see what they said actually hooked up with their experience, the fine detail of it, and not to assume that I knew exactly what kind of lived experience lay behind a familiar form of words.",12
1019,Parents as truth tellers,12
1020,"Even to get this far, I had to believe that what I was being told by people about their experiences and feelings was the truth, or essentially the truth.",12
1021,"I may have been wrong proportionately as many times as the result of an amniocentesis turns out to have been wrong: , being wrong in both cases amounts to a hypothetical possibility, but is not normal.",12
1022,"I decided, , that if a parent told me they had dreamt about having a ‘Down's baby’ before the birth — in the medical literature, this is a classic after-the-event self-deception — they had in fact had such a dream.",12
1023,"If they said they had not been upset on being told the diagnosis, this actually was the case; they were not suffering from amnesia.",12
1024,"If they became angry at things said to them by professionals, as a majority of them did at some point, the horrifying causes of their anger were true, and were not projections of their own distress the professional concerned.",12
1025,"To accept the truth of these accounts is a simple but giant step, and one which the academic and professional community is by its own self-definition incapable of taking: a social group which bases its very existence on its own claims to cleverness would risk its life if it opened even one ear to the voices of fools and heretics, especially when the topic itself is about foolishness in the form of ‘learning difficulties’.",12
1026,In what follows I have used my interviews with parents as a counterpoint to a professional judgement.,12
1027,"SHOCK, HORROR AND DEMYSTIFICATION",12
1028,‘When parents are first told that the baby has Down's Syndrome they are deeply shocked’(Cunningham 1982: 28).,12
1029,": With my other babies they've mostly left them quite close to me, but she was put over to the side, the doctor was slow in coming, and she went over and checked her over, coming to speak to me as they usually do — she went out again and didn't even look at me  [laughs]…",12
1030,I had an instant bond with Marie — I thought she was beautiful the moment she was born — I can really say that.,12
1031,"I thought she was beautiful, and I didn't mind about her being Down's Syndrome.",12
1032,"Mentally I was prepared to cope with it you see, I'd made my mind up right through my marriage that I would.",12
1033,"Every one of these parents can recount stories of being not believed, not looked at, not spoken to: that is what dead people experience, if the dead have experiences.",12
1034,"For Bernadette, it's amusing.",12
1035,"From this paediatrician's reaction, it seems the clinical notion of deep shock as a natural reaction is itself a projection of that professional's anxiety the parent.",12
1036,": He was six months old and I'd gone down for his second immunisation and I mean the doctor I went to see was a family doctor — I've known him since I was a baby — and he just, he was looking at him and he just said, ‘Is your husband Chinese?’",12
1037,"And I said, ‘No.’",12
1038,"And he just stuck the needle in his arm, and he said, ‘Well, I think the baby's a mongol’, and he showed me the door and that was it.",12
1039,He wasn't looking at me.,12
1040,"He was looking down and twiddling his pen, you know…and I mean I know it sounds stupid, but I didn't mind, I think I knew anyway.",12
1041,"I mean when he was born they laid him on me, he'd had the cord round his neck three times and he looked like a tortoise with his long neck and this little tiny head [laughs].",12
1042,"And I thought blimey, he's a mongol, you know, when you're looking at them, and then I was looking at the nurses and waiting for everyone to say something, and nobody said nothing.",12
1043,"And then I thought, I couldn't say ‘Here, is this baby a mongol?’ Stan, I think he would have fell over.",12
1044,Pat has reasons not to mind.,12
1045,"The baby is already six months old, and she has already made the diagnosis herself, at birth.",12
1046,", both her own parents had considerable physical disabilities.",12
1047,Both she and Bernadette have realised beforehand that the boundaries of human experience are wider than those indicated in the Mothercare catalogue.,12
1048,What about those who haven't?,12
1049,": Well the doctor was crying, she had tears in her eyes, and she said, ‘We've got some news.’",12
1050,"And then the stupid thing, the doctor said to me, ‘Does she look like anybody in your family?’",12
1051,"I said, ‘Well you don't have to tell me, I know she's a mongol.’",12
1052,"She said, ‘Oh — you a nurse?’",12
1053,"I said, ‘No, I can just tell by her face’…",12
1054,So I went back and see the baby in the incubator and then I went back to the ward.,12
1055,"None of the nurses spoke to me, nothing, till 2 o'clock that afternoon, which I'd had her at 7.30 in the morning…",12
1056,"Yeah, yeah, well I completely rejected her.",12
1057,"I knew she wasn't a hundred , I just didn't want to know her…",12
1058,The exact feelings…,12
1059,I wanted her to die…,12
1060,And I'll tell you the only reason I took the baby home was because Martin wanted her.,12
1061,"Now this looks more like it: a normal, natural reaction, I do have to search through several of the transcripts on my desk to find one.",12
1062,‘Natural’: does this mean that we all have a gene that determines we will be shocked?,12
1063,"In the clinical literature, the word ‘natural’ is left undefined (the medical description of this kind of shock goes back to the nineteenth-century discovery of ‘hysteria’and its symptoms in women).",12
1064,"Rita, however, takes care to define it, and is aware of the surrounding social circumstances.",12
1065,The baby had been taken away immediately and wired up in an incubator for three days.,12
1066,"Since Rita has been sent to Coventry, she has not been told that it is physically possible for her to open up the incubator herself and put her hands in.",12
1067,"Eventually a nurse does show her, and then ‘Once I'd touched her, she was mine.’",12
1068,She is further handicapped by having a sister-in-law (a nurse herself) who visits immediately after the diagnosis has been made and starts discussing fostering and adoption procedures.,12
1069,"Most importantly, Rita, just as she makes her own diagnosis, knows — unlike the professionals — exactly what the ‘shock’ is and that it comes from somewhere:",12
1070,": You know, the old story, my first thoughts when I had her, well one of my first thoughts, was Oh, I've got one of them kids that have silly haircuts, silly anoraks, spend all day on buses or all day in a home, weaving baskets, and that was my first thought…",12
1071,"I don't know, I always said I'd never took the piss these children, but I'm sure I must have done at school, but I must admit I embarrassed.",12
1072,I was embarrassed giving birth to a mongol.,12
1073,"If we was educated with handicapped, you know, if we'd mixed with them…but we never saw them.",12
1074,"I'd never spoken to one till we had Louise, you know, which is not fair on us normal people…",12
1075,"They're anti-social, handicapped people, and they're kept that way.",12
1076,"They're all at a different school all day, and they shop at different times…but you never see them in restaurants and why shouldn't they be?",12
1077,"They're just , you know.",12
1078,"Like many of the parents, Rita readily agrees with the professional maxim that ‘It's natural to feel shocked’, but she clearly does not take this to be some scientific and objective concomitant of the situation, something in her genes.",12
1079,"Such parents know that it is something they have been socialised into by a segregated society, and that things could have been otherwise: that they to be otherwise (It's not fair…’).",12
1080,Between the apparent extremes of these examples lie all sorts of individual circumstances.,12
1081,"Some parents' reaction to the diagnosis is nullified by the additional diagnosis of some life-threatening physical condition meningitis or a heart defect, which to them is more distressing.",12
1082,Some may have previously had a miscarriage or an infant who died.,12
1083,"For others who went through distress, over and over again the feelings behind the abstraction of ‘shock’ have to do, not with newly existent beings whom one doesn't know, but with existing people in one's life — partners, family, etc.",12
1084,"And none of them fails to recognise where these negative feelings come from, that such feelings have been  by a particular upbringing and environment.",12
1085,‘Shock’ and ‘trauma’must be seen as an example of what psychologists call reification: sets of concrete interpersonal and societal relationships are turned into an abstract ‘thing’which dominates our language and hence our way of thinking.,12
1086,"This self-perpetuating process of mystification that denies real feelings and experiences is a necessary prop to the status, power and basic philosophical values of a way of life; the teaching of negative feelings must go on.",12
1087,"What needs to be emphasised, though, is that direct experience — becoming part of a way of life that includes the alien in a wider definition of what it is to be human — seems to be almost the only way of achieving demystification.",12
1088,The only problem I had was people thinking I had problems.,12
1089,‘COMING TO TERMS’: WHOSE AND WHAT TERMS?,12
1090,For many parents it is the child they were expecting is dead.,12
1091,Many doctors think that it is important for parents to recognize these feelings and to go through a period of mourning for their lost imaginary baby…,12
1092,These feelings…may diminish in time the parent can come to terms with the fact that the baby has Down's Syndrome.,12
1093,"(Cunningham 1982: 31, 39)",12
1094,"A couple of hours after drafting this, I receive a call from a local health visitor asking advice about a child who has just been diagnosed.",12
1095,"She tells me that ‘the mother is just going through the process of grieving for the child she hasn't had’(the child is already eight months old): the health visitor's instruction in the art of creating unpersons has been exemplary, and she is keen to pass this the mother.",12
1096,": At school when you have these, you have lessons about childbirth and babies and things, nobody ever says like not all children are born, you know, normal.",12
1097,Antenatal classes should talk about it.,12
1098,"Although I said to my husband when I was pregnant, what if I have a handicapped baby?",12
1099,"And he said he wouldn't be able to cope, but it was in the pretext that it would never happen to us.",12
1100,But you've got to think about it if it happen to you.,12
1101,"I mean if it does, you, I think you find a way of coping with it.",12
1102,"There's no connection between the thought beforehand, and when it happens to you something different happens.",12
1103,": I'd always tended to shy them, like, because like I say I think it's the fear of the unknown, what you've been told.",12
1104,"If you don't understand something you normally tend to be aggressive towards it, don't you?…",12
1105,"Looking at what Micky's like and everything, when I thought before what it would be like and what the situation actually is, I think basically you're in another world, you know what I mean?",12
1106,Because it another world.,12
1107,Because what you're thinking it's going to be like is completely the opposite of what is happening.,12
1108,"For both ways of life and for both sets of values, excluders and includers, the language of ‘coping’ and ‘coming to terms’describes the transition between one world and another world; this much they agree on, the values they attach to these worlds are totally opposite.",12
1109,"Many parents can put their finger on a moment or incident when they experienced this transition, which they often mark as rebellion.",12
1110,": When the paediatrician come in next morning, I mean he only was in there two seconds, he looked her up and said ‘Typical mongol’, either ‘Typical mongol features’ or ‘Typical mongol face’, it was one of the two he said, and I could have killed him…",12
1111,"They put Jenny [Phil's wife]in a grotty old side ward she didn't upset any other of the patients, come in and tell us anything.",12
1112,"I grabbed one of the midwives, the senior one there, and I said to her, what happens now?",12
1113,"And they reiterated that they would like Becky to stay in for tests but Jenny could come home, and Becky was jaundiced you see.",12
1114,"I said what happens if she hadn't had Down's Syndrome, they said she could have gone home, so I said: ‘That's it, wrap her up, we're going home.",12
1115,"Start life as we mean to go on, we'll go home.’",12
1116,"That afternoon a friend came round, Ruth and Jim, and they come round with a bottle of champagne, the best you could buy, and it was just like we'd had a baby…",12
1117,"I mean I'd had a sort of cry I suppose, but at the actual time I was glad I had a daughter [after two sons].",12
1118,"And after he said typical mongol, I think, I don't know, it's awkward to explain: everything seemed to fall into place.",12
1119,"Just as the clinical professions can provide parents with the language and the concepts with which to take a negative view of the child, so they can provide the unwitting stimulus for the parent to enter a new, positive world in which things ‘fall into place’.",12
1120,": For some reason I thought of it that they've given me this monster of a baby that I wasn't going to be able to love, and some woman came round — she may have been the hospital social worker or an almoner — and spent about an hour telling me how this was going to completely change the course of my life, I was going to be saddled with this child that would need twenty-four hour care and attention, and I had to think carefully about whether I wanted that for the rest of my life, i.e. was I going to keep him — virtually talking me into not keeping him, and I think the turning-point was that I felt there was something coming from the outside that was, , really trying to urge me to reject him, and that I rebelled against it.",12
1121,"I can't say I had any positive feelings in the first place, but the realisation that everybody else had negative feelings made me love him.",12
1122,"The majority of parents reported being presented covertly or overtly with an opt-out clause when the diagnosis was first made, often couched : ‘Leave  the baby here for a couple of days, go home and think about it’(‘it’ being unspecified).",12
1123,"Cunningham (1982) reports that if parents decide to give up the baby permanently, it is ‘for the parents who make it, the right decision,.",12
1124,"It is important to note here than a parent is gripped by those negative fantasies that the textbooks claim to be real and universal, she is also immediately capable of embracing a critique of the values she is confronted with.",12
1125,"Perhaps we are now in a position to give, from a parental perspective, an alternative interpretation of what exactly it means to ‘come to terms with’ a child's disability.",12
1126,"For the clinical and educational professions (and the lay notions which derive their values from them), their very practice makes it clear what fact it is that you ‘come to terms’ with: you have not given birth to a member of the human species as we define it, and to which we allocate certain rights and social roles, but to an object of pathology — a ‘monster’, to use a technical term employed in medical anatomy.",12
1127,"For the parent, the same phrase means the inverse: I have not given birth to the monster which my upbringing and socialisation led me to believe I'd had, but to a normal member of the human species as I now define it.",12
1128,"This widening definition of what it is to be human, couched in sociologically aware terms, runs throughout the responses, and is further expressed in attitudes to amniocentesis and abortion in subsequent pregnancies.",12

1180,"Let us skirt round professor Joan Bicknell, a major authority in child psychiatry.",12

1182,"Following a time-honoured tradition of psychiatric categories, she elaborates the ‘bereavement response’ to diagnosis into a farrago of stages (none of whose terms, as far as I can make out, has ever been defined):(1)‘Shock’,(2)‘panic’,(3)‘Denial’,(4)‘Grief’,(5)‘Guilt’,(6)‘Anger’(),(7)‘Anger Against professionals’,(8)‘Bargaining’and finally (9)‘Acceptance’.",12

1195,A Statement for Balbinder,12
1196,Elizabeth Grugeon,12
1197,Elizabeth Grugeon provides a detailed account of her association with Balbinder Singh and his family.,12
1198,She was a friend and adviser for the family as they tried to negotiate a path through an education system which was not always easy to understand.,12
1199,Balbinder was the subject of a Statement and Elizabeth Grugeon charts the process from an initial expression of concern about Balbinder's lack of progress by the primary school to his transfer to a special school for pupils categorised as having ‘moderate learning difficulties’.,12
1200,MY INVOLVEMENT WITH THE FAMILY,12
1201,"A long-standing friendship with an Asian family who were neighbours of mine led to my being involved in the process of Statementing their youngest child, Balbinder Singh.",12
1202,"He was 6 years old and had been at the school for three terms when the head, knowing that I was a neighbour and friend of Balbinder's mother, invited me to go with Mrs Singh to a meeting with the educational psychologist.",12
1203,The head explained that he and the class teacher felt that Balbinder was making little progress and they were worried about his lack of concentration and poor language.,12
1204,They were considering the possibility of a place in a special school for children with moderate learning difficulties which could offer ‘smaller classes and more individual attention’.,12
1205,"His transfer would involve a lengthy and complicated assessment procedure, and they wanted me to help to explain this to Balbinder's parents and to reassure them.",12
1206,This chapter is an account of the process and is an attempt to see it from the family's perspective.,12
1207,I had known the family for some years as I had been Mrs Singh's English tutor on a local authority adult literacy programme.,12
1208,"Balbinder was 3 years old when I first started visiting the house, a very sociable child who eagerly awaited my arrival and the chance to play with the bag of toys I always brought with me.",12
1209,"Over the years, in my role as home tutor to his mother, I had had a privileged relationship with Balbinder and his family.",12
1210,"By the time he started school I had already been an intermediary between the family and the town hall, the DHSS, the local social services, the medical profession and school.",12
1211,"Mr and Mrs Singh kept most of their official correspondence between the pages of their telephone directory and on my weekly visits we sorted out the milk tokens, rates demands, post office giros, all of which made linguistic demands which were beyond the level of their competence.",12
1212,"Mr Singh, a Kenyan Asian, confessed to me, after I had been a friend of the family for several years, that he was neither fluent in Swahili, the language of his education 13, nor in Punjabi, his mother tongue.",12
1213,"However, the family spoke Punjabi exclusively at home and had very strong views on the need to do this.",12
1214,They were concerned that the boys should not lose touch with their language and culture.,12
1215,"The two older boys, aged 5 and 7, were competent in both languages.",12
1216,Balbinder seemed slower to talk and his mother was worried about his reluctance to speak English.,12
1217,As both parents spoke to him in Punjabi for most of the time this did not seem surprising.,12
1218,I reassured Mrs Singh that once he started playgroup there would be an improvement.,12
1219,"In fact the health visitor diagnosed a problem with speech at his screening at age 3, and he began attending the local health clinic for speech therapy.",12
1220,Mrs Singh mentioned this once or twice but did not seem to set much store by it.,12
1221,She continued to express concern at what she felt to be his backwardness at speaking English.,12
1222,I wondered how many people he had the opportunity to speak to outside his family.,12
1223,"However, the playgroup run by local parents had not been the success for Balbinder that we had hoped.",12
1224,There were complaints about his behaviour.,12
1225,"He did not seem to know how to play, would not settle down, ran about too much and fought with the other children.",12
1226,"At home, whenever I visited, he always seemed the same docile, attractive child sitting silently watching TV in the impeccably tidy and attractive furnished living room of the very small, terraced house.",12
1227,"In the house, the lives of the three young boys seemed quiet, calm and disciplined.",12
1228,"But the large hall at playgroup, the number of activities, different experiences and other children seemed to produce excitable and often aggressive behaviour in Balbinder.",12
1229,"The staff were also worried about his speech, not seeming to take into account the fact that this was the first time he had come a Punjabi-speaking environment and was having to cope with new experiences in a foreign language.",12
1230,"His mother's fluent, though inaccurate, English and confident manner may have led them to expect more of him.",12
1231,"Mrs Singh worried about him , and was often very angry at his apparent lack of progress.",12
1232,"She wanted him to learn to count, begin to write, and above all to speak English.",12
1233,"She and the children visited my house regularly at this period, I could hear the oldest boy, Ravi, read.",12
1234,He had already overtaken his mother and she did not know how to cope with the graded readers he brought home from school or his teacher's request that she should hear him read.,12
1235,Whenever they visited me I listened to him reading.,12
1236,He was quite fluent but seemed to read without comprehension.,12
1237,I felt that the texts he was reading did not speak of familiar experiences or vocabulary.,12
1238,I remember him struggling with a story where understanding of the narrative depended on the reader knowing about canals.,12
1239,"He could read the  words —— but the illustrations of an urban canal with tall, industrial buildings and long painted boats portrayed an unknown landscape.",12
1240,At 8 he was rapidly becoming a non-reader.,12
1241,The idea that reading might be for pleasure had not occurred to him.,12
1242,"Balbinder was always pleased to come along for these sessions, to play with my children's toys and run in the garden.",12
1243,Mrs Singh brought her letters and forms for me to elucidate.,12
1244,I was constantly surprised at the extent to which she needed explanations for even the most taken-for-granted aspects of junior school life.,12
1245,The list of clothing for a school trip included ‘night-dress’ and ‘sponge-bag’.,12
1246,"The Singh children slept in their underpants, and she wondered whether I could lend her a ‘night-dress’ for Ravi and also a sponge.",12
1247,Almost all documents sent home from school were incomprehensible.,12
1248,"Letters inviting parents to join the parent — teacher association, visit the ‘Spring Fayre’, to volunteer for ‘parent-governor elections’, or attend a ‘Maths Workshop’ were put in the bin after my attempts to explain them.",12
1249,Schools unwittingly erect a language barrier which must exclude great numbers of parents.,12
1250,"End of term reports contained phrases like ‘his development of spatial awareness, or ‘his confidence on the apparatus’.",12
1251,"However phrases like ‘is working hard’, ‘always tries his best’, ‘is beginning to show some improvement, did not fool her.",12
1252,She interpreted them quite accurately to mean that her children were under-achieving and the message she took from them was almost always a negative one.,12
1253,On one occasion Mrs Singh had asked me to go with her to visit one of the boy's teachers.,12
1254,The teacher was brusque and busy.,12
1255,"She brushed aside Mrs Singh's assertions that her son was not making progress by telling her repeatedly that it was unreasonable to expect anything more; she used phrases like ‘He is well below average’, ‘He is slow’, ‘He is in the bottom set, you must accept that.",12
1256,You can't put it there if it's not there.’,12
1257,Mrs Singh was not satisfied.,12
1258,"She wanted to know why he never brought anything home, why he had no reading book.",12
1259,His teacher explained that homework for 8 year olds was not school policy and Jeetinder was called in to show his mother that he could read.,12
1260,"He produced his reading book, one of the ‘pirate series’ by Sheila Mccullagh, and read quite fluently.",12
1261,"The teacher suggested that Mrs Singh could help by reading with him, Mrs Singh to read one line, Jeetinder the next; she was evidently unaware of the possibility that Jeetinder's reading could be more competent than his mother's.",12
1262,Looking at a piece of work on the board Mrs Singh said she wanted her son to write like that.,12
1263,"The teacher, worn down by Mrs Singh's refusal to accept Jeetinder's limitations, told her that it had been written by ‘a highly intelligent girl’.",12
1264,She continued to try to convince Mrs Singh that although Jeetinder was in the bottom set he was doing well and was not ‘the bottom of the bottom set’.,12
1265,"None of this convinced Mrs Singh who left the classroom saying in an unusually dictatorial tone to the class teacher, ‘I want you to sort him out and bring homework home.’",12
1266,"Later, I tried to mollify her by pointing out that the teacher had said what a nice boy he was.",12
1267,"Looking me straight in the eye she replied, ‘Nice is in every child.’",12
1268,"The school's educational psychologist had made contact with the family when he had been involved in an assessment of Jeetinder, the second son, now in the fourth year at the school.",12
1269,There had been concern about his progress at the same stage as there now was for Balbinder's.,12
1270,Mrs Singh had been visited at home and the head had arranged for me to be present I could explain and reinforce any suggestions.,12
1271,"In the event, I found this difficult as they seemed inappropriate.",12
1272,The psychologist had suggested among other things that Mrs Singh could help to improve Jeetinder's spoken and written language by reading to him at bedtime and could help to improve his numeracy by encouraging him to spend and account for his pocket money.,12
1273,Both ideas were culturally alien to Mrs Singh.,12
1274,"There were no English children's books in the house, and the boys did not shop on their own nor have regular pocket money.",12
1275,Neither parent was fully literate in English or their mother tongue.,12
1276,"Mrs Singh had seemed mystified by the advice, as she believed the school should be responsible for progress in English and mathematics and shrugged helplessly when I suggested that parents also had an important role.",12
1277,THE STATEMENTS PROCESS FOR BALBINDER,12
1278,My contact with the family had lapsed for a while when the head asked to see me to request help in explaining the Statementing procedures to Mrs Singh.,12
1279,The head told me that Mrs Singh had been coming to school regularly to express concern about Balbinder's lack of progress.,12
1280,"The class teacher and the head were also worried; they felt that, ‘after four terms at school, he is the slowest in the class’.",12
1281,"Their concern was that in September, when he should be moving into the second year infants with his age cohort, he would be far behind.",12
1282,The head had asked the educational psychologist to come and assess him producing a formal Statement of Special Educational Needs.,12
1283,"Standardised tests had shown that ‘whereas his two older brothers had scored better on verbal ability than on visual motor ability, Balbinder had performed equally poorly on both’.",12
1284,As a result the educational psychologist had been investigating the possibility of a place at a local special school for Balbinder.,12
1285,They now wanted to explain all this to Mrs Singh and hoped that I would be able to explain the implications of what they were going to say.,12
1286,"The same morning Mrs Singh had approached me in the school foyer, handed me a bag full of letters, and burst into tears.",12
1287,I realised that I hadn't visited her for some weeks and agreed to go to her house after school.,12
1288,"As an outside observer drawn into the Statementing process by the professionals involved, I had a neutral but not disinterested role.",12
1289,I kept a diary of events and attempted to chart the process by which 6-year-old Balbinder was removed from mainstream education.,12
1290,March 3: The initial meeting,12
1291,"Meeting with the head, the school's educational psychologist, Mrs Singh and myself at school.",12
1292,The head explained to Mrs Singh that Balbinder was not making much progress and that class sizes he would be unlikely to receive the kind of attention he needed.,12
1293,"He explained that at Cedars (the local authority's school for children ‘with learning difficulties’) where classes are small and the teachers are specialists at coping with Balbinder's sort of problems, he might do better.",12
1294,"He stressed that it was essential for Balbinder to start at Cedars as soon as possible, if he was going to catch up.",12
1295,"He seemed to be suggesting that once Balbinder had been at Cedars for a while, he might be capable of re-entering mainstream education at middle school transfer.",12
1296,This was an idea she was to hold on to throughout the process.,12
1297,"Both the head and the educational psychologist stressed the positive value of Cedars and the likely problems for Balbinder if he stayed on at his present school, which they told her did not have the expertise to cope with his needs.",12
1298,By suggesting this they began quite unwittingly to undermine her confidence in the school and in herself.,12
1299,"She became very upset and confused, clearly feeling that Balbinder's failure was her fault.",12
1300,She cried repeatedly saying ‘He always wants to play…he just wants toys.’,12
1301,"When she was calmer, she also made it clear that she felt that a stricter approach that forced Balbinder to concentrate and work harder was all that was needed.",12
1302,"She felt that he was not doing well because he was not trying hard enough, and that his teachers were not making him try hard enough.",12
1303,She listened intently as they explained the Statementing procedure.,12
1304,They stressed that the decision to send Balbinder to Cedars would be made by Mrs Singh and her husband.,12
1305,The first stage would be to visit the school and then return to discuss the matter again.,12
1306,A date was arranged for the following week for both events and I agreed to go with them.,12
1307,"What I did not realise at the time, but discovered later, was that Mrs Singh had no idea that transfer next September had been suggested — she expected that it would happen .",12
1308,"After she had left, the head and educational psychologist explained the Statementing procedure in more detail.",12
1309,In the past they had waited until after the school screening tests at 7-plus but felt that this was leaving it too late.,12
1310,In Balbinder's case it was not simply that he was a slow learner.,12
1311,There were what the head called ‘social concerns’ behind his transfer.,12
1312,"He was developing self-control in the classroom, but found it harder on the playground where it seemed that he was easily influenced by other children to behave badly.",12
1313,"As he put it, ‘He reverts when he is with naughty children.’",12
1314,They had not given these reasons for transfer to his parents.,12
1315,Yet they were clearly important considerations as far as the school was concerned.,12
1316,It was not a foregone conclusion that there would be a place available at Cedars since there is a lot of pressure on special school places in the county.,12
1317,"As the head of Cedars was making his entry list for September already, and would have to submit it by the end of the week, the educational psychologist was going to request a place for Balbinder before Statementing him.",12
1318,Thus it was essential to get Mr and Mrs Singh's agreement as soon as possible.,12
1319,"Later on the same day, I visited Mr and Mrs Singh at home.",12
1320,Over tea and food we talked about the school's suggestion.,12
1321,Mrs Singh was upset; she felt rejected by the school her children had been attending for five years.,12
1322,She was depressed and angry with Balbinder.,12
1323,She had been crying and said that she had been ‘feeling awful’ all day.,12
1324,She clearly found it hard to sort out the implications of what was being suggested.,12
1325,However we agreed to visit Cedars together in a few days' time.,12
1326,The difficulty she was having in making sense of the boys' education was illustrated by the packet of letters she had brought to school in the morning.,12
1327,"One from the LEA was about her 8-year-old son's transfer to middle school, an event generating a great deal of paper including a list of the available schools; another letter from the LEA explained parents' rights of choice and appeal, also dates of open evenings; yet another letter from the school to which he had been allocated required the parents to sign the tear-off slip and return it to their present school.",12
1328,"Fortunately, I noticed that he had been given a place at a different school from his older brother and that it was actually a matter of filling in the appeal form requesting a place at another school.",12
1329,I suggested that they should also accept the invitation to take him to visit his new school's Open Evening.,12
1330,Mrs Singh said she would go if I came too but not otherwise.,12
1331,Another letter from the middle school was about a visiting theatre group and asked for money a tear-off slip.,12
1332,We discussed with her 10-year-old son whether he wanted to see the play and we put the money for a ticket in an envelope.,12
1333,To his chagrin we threw away the letter about a skiing holiday.,12
1334,At nearly £400 for a week in Austria his parents were not interested.,12
1335,In the evening I consulted a friend who is also a local head teacher.,12
1336,Her school has a high proportion of ethnic minority children where I felt Balbinder might not have seemed such a problem.,12
1337,"In her opinion, it was unlikely that he would get a place at Cedars at such a late stage in the year.",12
1338,She also felt that age 6 was too early to make what she saw as a drastic decision — once mainstream education she felt he would be unlikely to get back.,12
1339,"At this stage in the proceedings, my own feelings were mixed.",12
1340,If the school felt it could not cope with Balbinder then maybe he would be better in a more sympathetic environment.,12
1341,On the other hand Mrs Singh would lose all her social contacts in the local community once she did not have to take him to school every day.,12
1342,The school gave her a point of reference and contact with other mothers.,12
1343,The middle school which both her older boys attended was a long walk from her home and made little or no attempt to involve parents.,12
1344,"If Balbinder was bussed to Cedars every day she would be effectively cut off from any real involvement in her children's schooling, and from an important part of her own role  within the community as the mother of a young child at the local school.",12
1345,On the other hand I knew that her confidence in Balbinder's school had been profoundly shaken by the interview with the head and educational psychologist.,12
1346,If Balbinder didn't get a place at Cedars this year she would become even more anxious about his progress.,12
1347,March 9: Visiting Cedars School,12
1348,The head made us very welcome.,12
1349,He began by talking to Mr and Mrs Singh about the school.,12
1350,He stressed the normality of the children who attended it.,12
1351,He explained that children came to Cedars when their own school could not give them the individual help with basic skills which they needed.,12
1352,He explained that when a child becomes anxious he or she may stop learning.,12
1353,"Cedars, he told them, was a special school because it had special teachers with special skills and training.",12
1354,All of the sixteen teachers in the school were experienced in teaching children with learning difficulties.,12
1355,"Another special feature was the size of the groups, ten in the first year, twelve in the second and fifteen thereafter.",12
1356,Balbinder would be in a group with ten children.,12
1357,Mrs Singh seemed to be listening intently but I guess that a lot of what was being said went over her head.,12
1358,"I am not sure that she even knows the word ‘special’; and phrases like ‘learning difficulties’, ‘becomes anxious’, ‘experienced’ are not necessarily familiar.",12
1359,"After a while she asked, ‘These children, do they learn it at the end?’",12
1360,The head replied that the school offered ideal circumstances and that most children responded positively.,12
1361,There is an annual review in which a report is made on the child's progress.,12
1362,"All parents, he told them, have the right to say, ‘I want my child to leave’, and he said, ‘Our job is to help the child go back.’",12
1363,They review this possibility annually and he explained that when they have identified children who will go back they let them go into mainstream school for a morning and then one day a week.,12
1364,At the moment six children would be going back into middle school in September.,12
1365,"At this point Mrs Singh said comfortably, ‘They have learnt, that's nice.’",12
1366,The head went on to explain that the school's job was to understand each child's problem.,12
1367,He told them that many children learned more slowly.,12
1368,"He illustrated different ways in which reading, , could be taught, and how some children may not be ‘mature’ enough to cope with a ‘look and say’approach, or may not develop that way.",12
1369,"He explained how ‘look and say’ uses eyes, while phonics uses ears.",12
1370,"Mr and Mrs Singh listened politely but, possibly, were confused by all this specialist terminology.",12
1371,He went on to tell them about the school.,12
1372,The children started at 5 and could stay until 16.,12
1373,They could also leave at any time.,12
1374,"Each part of the school — lower/ middle/upper — resembled mainstream school, the difference lying in the size of the teaching group.",12
1375,At 16-plus they go on to college for two years and follow courses which will lead to work.,12
1376,Several of the 15 year olds were on work experience at the moment.,12
1377,He then took us round the school.,12
1378,The lower school had its own grassed and paved play area with plentiful equipment.,12
1379,"The rooms were small, purpose built, had carpeted floors, and each teacher had a non-teaching assistant.",12
1380,It was an intimate small-scale non-threatening environment.,12
1381,I was particularly impressed by the art room.,12
1382,"The workshop and home economics area were also impressive, and the school had three computers.",12
1383,Outside was very pleasant with views over open fields and a local park.,12
1384,Part of the senior side had been landscaped to make an attractive outdoor work area with wooden table and benches made in the workshop.,12
1385,There was a swimming pool and a distant view of the donkey field.,12
1386,"There seemed to be few ethnic minority children, one in each class perhaps, certainly none in the youngest group.",12
1387,After the visit the head talked about the importance of parental involvement.,12
1388,"He explained that regular contact and discussion of ways in which parents can help at home was vital: ‘Together, we can achieve more.’",12
1389,The school had an open-door policy.,12
1390,He then put it to Mr and Mrs Singh that they would have to think about whether they would like Balbinder to come to the school.,12
1391,"He explained that there were a limited number of places, with sixteen or seventeen taken up for September already (I wondered whether this meant Balbinder might be unlucky, but did not like to ask).",12
1392,He explained the procedure by which Balbinder would be given a place.,12
1393,The educational psychologist would prepare notes on Balbinder.,12
1394,He himself would visit Balbinder at his present school.,12
1395,"He stressed, ‘We only want him to come if it's right.",12
1396,Nothing happens until you say yes.’,12
1397,"Then Mr and Mrs Singh would come again with Balbinder, and finally they would receive a letter from County Hall.",12
1398,"Again, he stressed that the final decision lay with them: ‘He will not come until you sign it…in the end you decide.’",12
1399,Mr Singh asked his first question: ‘Would it be next September?’,12
1400,The head said that that would be the case and that Balbinder would stay for as long as he needed their help.,12
1401,However they could make the decision to take him away ‘at any time’.,12
1402,Mrs Singh asked ‘Do you have the same holiday?’ and then spoke for the first time about Balbinder.,12
1403,"She seemed distressed, ‘I mean Balbinder, he used to just sit by the telly, even now he still…he wants toys…he doesn't want to do the things, he wants to do all the time what he wants to do…’",12
1404,"The head nodded reassuringly, seeming to listen, but he did not encourage her to talk about Balbinder any more.",12
1405,Instead he went on to tell them that the shortest time they kept pupils was for two years but that usually they tried to move people back into mainstream at the time for transfer to middle/upper school.,12
1406,He told them that the educational psychologist was very good and really knew the children.,12
1407,"Mrs Singh, still pursuing her own thoughts, said, ‘I wish he was just like other children, like my other children.’",12
1408,"The head said it was important to think about ‘whatever is best’ for Balbinder, and went back to what the school catered for —‘people think it's for mentally handicapped’.",12
1409,"‘It doesn't look like one’, said Mrs Singh very positively.",12
1410,"The head told them that there were many different special schools in the county and explained where and what each one  was for, reassuring them that Cedars is ‘a school for children who have difficulty getting started with basic skills’.",12
1411,Its job is to help children ‘who are struggling’.,12
1412,He gave Mr and Mrs Singh a school booklet and saw us out.,12
1413,"We rang for a taxi and while we waited, looked at books of photographs of school plays, trips, art work and sports days.",12
1414,Both Mr and Mrs Singh seemed surprised and relieved by the normality of the school.,12
1415,Mr Singh told me that one of his brothers-in-law had told them it was a school for mentally handicapped.,12
1416,This had clearly been worrying them both.,12
1417,When we got home I could see that they were ready to agree to the move.,12
1418,It was also evident that they had not weighed up the consequences.,12
1419,It all seemed easy — they sign on the dotted line and Balbinder would be virtually taken their hands.,12
1420,"Despite the school's stated intention to involve parents as far as possible, I seriously doubted whether Mr or Mrs Singh would be capable or prepared to enter into the kind of partnership the school envisaged.",12
1421,"Looking through the booklet the head had given them, I guessed that they would have some difficulty making sense of it.",12
1422,"They would probably need help with sentences like, ‘class teachers, together with the help of the remedial specialist, ensure that there is a detailed understanding of the learning difficulties of each individual child.’",12
1423,"Terms like, ‘environmental work’, ‘a full curriculum’, ‘special programmes of work for language development’ would need to be explained to them.",12
1424,The school's expressed intention is that ‘parents are helped to understand the nature of the learning difficulties of their child and are encouraged to visit the school frequently to develop that understanding and to continue that approach at home.’,12
1425,Neither Mr nor Mrs Singh have the confidence to take on such a role.,12
1426,March 12: Coping with the procedure,12
1427,I met with Mrs Singh and the educational psychologist in the head's room.,12
1428,Mrs Singh was very certain — she and her husband had decided that they both want Balbinder to go to Cedars.,12
1429,I tried to explore the problems Mrs Singh would have in attempting to be a fully participating parent but the educational psychologist seemed to feel that this was a problem common to many Cedars parents.,12
1430,"The educational psychologist spent some time explaining the legal side of Statementing, which is complex.",12
1431,"He told us that it would take many weeks to sort out and would involve a variety of procedures, a medical, reports from the school and visits.",12
1432,There would be twenty-nine days between the initial letter from County Hall and any action.,12
1433,The sheer amount of information seemed daunting.,12
1434,I arranged to visit that afternoon and to go through it with Mr and Mrs Singh.,12
1435,When I arrived they showed me the letter they had received from the Chief Education Officer that morning which explained the proposed Statementing procedure:,12
1436,The learning difficulties being experienced by your child were discussed and  you agreed that your child probably has a special educational need which requires further investigation.,12
1437,Therefore it is proposed to carry out an assessment of your child's needs under the Education Act 1981 with your agreement.,12
1438,The letter was at pains to stress the parents' involvement and their rights: ‘If it is agreed that the Authority should determine the special educational provision for your child…your further rights under the Education Act 1981 will be explained to you.’,12
1439,An enclosed booklet gave further general information about the provision of special education with an addendum summarising the legal rights of parents the assessment process.,12
1440,"In this, the mysterious twenty-nine days was explained: ‘parents will have a period of 29 days in which to seek further information from the Chief Education Officer and to make representations and submit written evidence.’",12
1441,"Since they had evidently made up their minds, none of this seemed important to them.",12
1442,"Going through the Cedars' brochure with them, however, they were pleased to find a statement which they could relate to, namely that the school sets out to help children, ‘who are having problems in learning to read, find spelling and writing difficult, are unable to express themselves well, are unable to settle and concentrate…’",12
1443,All these seemed to relate to Balbinder's needs as his parents saw them and Mr and Mrs Singh were beginning to seem happier.,12
1444,"As they understood it, after a short while Balbinder might be sorted out and returned to mainstream.",12
1445,I did not feel so optimistic.,12
1446,"The brochure stated clearly that while some children transferred back to mainstream schools, ‘the majority remain until they are 16 years of age’.",12
1447,June 5: Testing,12
1448,Visited Mrs Singh at home.,12
1449,She told me that she had been present when Balbinder was tested by the educational psychologist.,12
1450,Balbinder had had to do a lot of puzzles.,12
1451,The psychologist had said he was good with his hands.,12
1452,Mrs Singh said he would not sit down and kept walking about.,12
1453,"She said he was the same at home, only wanted to play with toys and watch TV, he wouldn't do any ‘work’.",12
1454,I was not sure what she meant by ‘work’.,12
1455,She went on to her worries about Jeetinder who still wasn't bringing anything home from school.,12
1456,She was being racially harassed and was afraid to go out into her garden.,12
1457,Her husband was away in India for three weeks.,12
1458,People were throwing things over her garden wall and someone had painted on the front door.,12
1459,We spent a lot of time discussing this.,12
1460,In some ways Balbinder seemed the least of her problems at the time.,12
1461,Perhaps it was a relief that matters were being taken her hands.,12
1462,We agreed to meet at school the following week.,12
1463,June 10: The information for the Statement,12
1464,"First, the head went through the school report, details of birth, address, etc.",12
1465,There was a brief account of professional intervention to date.,12
1466,"Before starting school he had attended the child development centre, received speech therapy and since had been seen on several occasions by the educational psychologist.",12
1467,"Then, there was a description of the child's functioning: he had taken a long time to settle into school, e.g. routine and order of the class.",12
1468,He had communication problems — speech and English language were not good.,12
1469,"He had difficulty ‘sounding’ this, and it was thought to be affecting his progress in learning to read.",12
1470,The head attempted to explain to Mrs Singh how children have to learn the initial sounds of words and how having two languages can impede this.,12
1471,I think Mrs Singh understood.,12
1472,"Balbinder has also had difficulty learning colours, numbers and sounds.",12
1473,His progress was slow because his retention was poor.,12
1474,"At this point Mrs Singh looking concerned said, ‘You think there's something wrong with him inside of him?’",12
1475,"The head said, ‘No, he's not ill.’",12
1476,Mrs Singh agreed that it must be the way he forgot things.,12
1477,"The head said ‘Yes, he does have difficulty remembering — particularly sounding’, and felt that this could be because he was perhaps more fluent in Punjabi.",12
1478,There were discrepancies in the report.,12
1479,"On the one hand Mrs Singh was told that his drawing and writing were immature, that he was still drawing and writing like a very young child; yet later she was told that he was very good with a pencil and talented at art!",12
1480,"Having said that he was very immature the report added that there had been considerable improvement, but it had taken a long time (he had only been at school for four terms and had had a change of teacher).",12
1481,"The head stressed that what Balbinder needed was to be in a small group, not in a class of twenty-three.",12
1482,for him to maintain interest he needed to work in short spurts.,12
1483,"In his present situation, his difficulty in concentrating took up a lot of the teacher's time.",12
1484,The head then commented on his social development.,12
1485,Here they felt there had been much progress.,12
1486,"Balbinder used to be ‘wild’, but he had learned to share and to take part in group work, despite still being a very lively child.",12
1487,The head then went on to describe the aims and provision of special education.,12
1488,"Since Balbinder clearly made more progress in a small group where he could have a lot of attention, and where all worked at the same pace, this could be an answer.",12
1489,The head felt that the boy needed somebody permanently watching him.,12
1490,"Also he needed a lot of talking in English, as he was still not sounding words clearly.",12
1491,"Further he was a very active child, and needed specialist apparatus.",12
1492,They had all the necessary facilities and resources at Cedars.,12
1493,"The head was very persuasive, showing concern for the way Balbinder would react when (or if) he fell behind.",12
1494,"As he was already behind in mastering the basic skills which lay the foundation for all further work, he felt that Balbinder needed a lot of help if he was to do justice to his abilities.",12
1495,"And he said very kindly, ‘That's our view of Balbinder.’",12
1496,The educational psychologist gave his report.,12
1497,He reiterated that Balbinder's problems with language had needed attention before school.,12
1498,He stressed that he was a very likeable little boy.,12
1499,"However, observing him in the classroom he had noticed his immature behaviour.",12
1500,"He ran about a lot, and found concentration difficult.",12
1501,Despite much improvement in pencil and art work there had been none in reading and other school work.,12
1502,He was fidgety and in a dream world when being given instruction in a group.,12
1503,Often he watched other children and then followed and copied them.,12
1504,The psychologist commented that Balbinder had liked having a reading book and clearly wanted to read but when it came to reading he did not understand what he was doing but relied on guessing.,12
1505,"He clearly wanted to do well, wanted to read but needed a lot of extra help.",12
1506,"When asked questions he gave one word answers, though he used two words on occasion, as in ‘boys swimming’, ‘wet play’.",12
1507,"On the tests he gave him he was better on puzzles and patterns, poor on those involving speaking and understanding.",12
1508,He felt that Balbinder needed to work slowly and not be pushed — he needed more time and specific help to speak in sentences.,12
1509,"At this point Mrs Singh said, ‘They are not allowed to speak English at home.’",12
1510,She felt that he spoke better in Punjabi and that he remembered better in Punjabi.,12
1511,"She referred to her own family: parents, brother and sisters who all spoke English at home.",12
1512,She found this very odd.,12
1513,"At the weekend when she had taken Balbinder to stay with his grandparents in Coventry, her brother had been trying to teach Balbinder to say ‘can I’, or ‘May I’ ‘I want to’.",12
1514,"The educational psychologist listened tolerantly to Mrs Singh's comments, did not respond to them but simply repeated that Balbinder needed to be with teachers who were experienced in working with small groups.",12
1515,Mrs Singh said that she felt that Balbinder would always do what was wanted if it suited him.,12
1516,The educational psychologist told her that one of the teachers from Cedars had visited Balbinder in school and made very positive comments.,12
1517,It seemed that a place was available but that all the complex procedures had to be completed before it could be offered to them.,12
1518,He still had to have a medical.,12
1519,The head would speak to the school doctor that same day.,12
1520,Social Services would write to Mrs Singh.,12
1521,The procedure was necessarily long-winded but it could be completed by the end of term.,12
1522,Mrs Singh expressed a worry about Balbinder refusing to dress himself and ordering her to get him ready for school when he could do this perfectly well if he wanted to.,12
1523,The educational psychologist said this was understandable while he was feeling rather unsettled.,12
1524,The head said he would chase up the documents.,12
1525,Mrs Singh seemed bewildered by the amount of information she had been given.,12
1526,I promised to go and see her again on Friday morning.,12
1527,"Throughout this interview Mrs Singh, who was still struggling to grasp the implications of what the head and educational psychologist were telling her, attempted to contribute.",12
1528,Her anecdotes were treated courteously but no real response was made.,12
1529,It seemed that now the process was her contribution was not required.,12
1530,June 12,12
1531,I visited Mr and Mrs Singh.,12
1532,"Mrs Singh and I talked Mr Singh through the meeting, point by point.",12
1533,"He agreed with the head's account of Balbinder's lack of concentration, which obviously worried them both .",12
1534,He listened to what I had to say about the procedure still to be gone through and hoped that they would soon hear whether Balbinder had a place.,12
1535,I said that this was almost certain but the process was rather slow.,12
1536,Mrs Singh agreed to tell me when she heard from the doctor.,12
1537,They both understood that this was a formality and that he was not thought to be ‘ill’.,12
1538,What particularly concerned me was their feeling that Balbinder seemed to understand and respond better in Punjabi.,12
1539,Mrs Singh expressed her feelings that it was very important for all her children to speak Punjabi and she was afraid that they might not do this if she and Mr Singh spoke English.,12
1540,Both parents were very concerned that he should get more appropriate help and were now convinced that this would be provided at Cedars.,12
1541,June 22: Acceptance,12
1542,Mrs and Mrs Singh had received a letter offering Balbinder a place at Cedars.,12
1543,They had understood the gist but needed help.,12
1544,We filled in the acceptance form and phoned the school about a visit.,12
1545,The school secretary said all the September intake would be invited for a morning before the end of term.,12
1546,"Balbinder, who had been excluded from all deliberations about his future, had not seen his new school yet.",12
1547,July 15: Balbinder visits his new school,12
1548,"Mrs Singh, Balbinder and I set off to visit Cedars School.",12
1549,Balbinder was very subdued.,12
1550,"His mother said he was not happy about the new school, and wanted to stay where he was.",12
1551,"He had, after all, had five terms there, he would be 7 in December.",12
1552,He did not speak all the way.,12
1553,Mrs Singh remarked what a long way it seemed.,12
1554,We were early and stood in the playground.,12
1555,Balbinder looked around but clung to Mrs Singh.,12
1556,We went in and were ushered into the hall where a number of other new children were looking at books of photos of school trips and events.,12
1557,We were asked to sit in the third and fourth rows and the lower school children filed in.,12
1558,The head explained that the school had a lower/middle/ upper division and the lower school head briefly explained that the children were going to show the parents and new children what they had been doing.,12
1559,Each year group described a recent trip and showed photos and work they had done.,12
1560,"The classes were small, as was the number of ethnic minority children.",12
1561,"There were one, or possibly two, Afro-Caribbean children overall and one or two Asian children in each group.",12
1562,Mrs Singh and Balbinder noticed each one and commented.,12
1563,"It was hot and the demonstration went on much too long, but it  gave us all some idea of how caring the teachers were and it was a practical illustration of what the school was trying to do.",12
1564,The children were then asked to go out to play.,12
1565,Balbinder was very reluctant and clung to his mother.,12
1566,He had lost interest in the activities.,12
1567,"There had been too much ‘talk and show’ early on and he had been wriggling about, scraping his chair back and causing Mrs Singh to reprimand him constantly.",12
1568,"It looked we would have to take him out but an older Asian boy came and took him away, and he went quite confidently.",12
1569,"The head then told the parents about travel, uniform, swimming (once a week all the year round), the PTA, illnesses, notes for absence or non-swimming and, above all, contacting the school whenever in doubt.",12
1570,We were then taken to have coffee and the school secretary handed out official forms for the parents to fill in.,12
1571,Mrs Singh filled them in although she had already expressed alarm at the number of notes she was going to have to write to the school.,12
1572,Classes were allocated and Balbinder was to be in class 1 with a Mrs Allinson and a nursery assistant.,12
1573,"It was small, with its own toilets and washbasins and an entirely private playground.",12
1574,"Balbinder ran outside , gesturing to me to come and look at it.",12
1575,"In the playground they had a sturdy wooden house with door and windows, climbing and swinging equipment and lots of small bicycles and tricycles.",12
1576,"In the classroom, photos of the trip to the seaside were on display and there were small circular tables.",12
1577,It was all on a scale much more appropriate for children than the high vaulting of his previous school and there was much more play equipment.,12
1578,This filled Mrs Singh with horror.,12
1579,"She was worried by the way he roamed about touching everything, and during a long chat to Mrs Allinson expressed her concern that he could not get on with anything, and could not write or read.",12
1580,Mrs Allinson was very reassuring.,12
1581,"However, Mrs Singh clearly saw Cedars as a temporary phase.",12
1582,"Earlier on, in the playground, as Balbinder had gradually gained confidence and begun to explore and use things Mrs Singh had said, wistfully, ‘I do hope Balbinder learn so quickly he will soon go back to his school.’",12
1583,"On the way out the head knelt down to say goodbye to Balbinder, who was still looking rather mystified but was much less clinging and was smiling more.",12
1584,"In the car on the way home he sat alone, opened the window and put his head out.",12
1585,It was very hard to imagine what he made of what was going on.,12
1586,had consulted him and he didn't seem to want to talk about it.,12
1587,In all these transactions Balbinder seemed a shadowy figure.,12
1588,Decisions were being taken about his future which could explain to him.,12
1589,Over the last few months he had become rather withdrawn and mistrustful; a subdued version of his former self.,12
1590,At Cedars Mrs Singh had instantly made friends with a young Asian woman (wearing trousers and a shirt) with a little girl who was evidently a year older than Balbinder.,12
1591,She and Mrs Singh spoke in Punjabi but her English sounded local and I suspected that she preferred to speak English.,12
1592,"However, Mrs Singh was pleased to meet her and generally liked all the teachers and what she saw.",12
1593,I wondered whether she had any misgivings.,12
1594,The distance will certainly be a  problem.,12
1595,What she was making of this experience was also hard to imagine.,12
1596,"Choice seemed to have been taken her, but some of her anxieties had also been allayed.",12
1597,PROGRESS REPORT,12
1598,In September Balbinder started at Cedars.,12
1599,My contact with the family became much less frequent.,12
1600,"Their circumstances had changed: Mr Singh had a full-time job, they had taken a big step and purchased their council house and Mrs Singh now felt that she needed permanent work herself.",12
1601,The job she finally acquired during the summer holidays meant leaving home before the children and returning after them.,12
1602,The coach which picked up the Cedars' children stopped about five minutes' walk their home.,12
1603,"Balbinder had to be seen onto it, and met at the end of the day.",12
1604,For the first few weeks of term this was a problem.,12
1605,Mr Singh could take him to the bus when he was on late shifts and collect him on early shifts.,12
1606,"His brothers aged 8 and 10, whose school was a long walk in the opposite direction, had to be relied take this responsibility when their father could not.",12
1607,The whole operation caused Mrs Singh a great deal of anxiety.,12
1608,"By half-term, a local parent with a child at Cedars had offered to put Balbinder on the coach in the morning and let him stay at her house until he could be picked up in the evening.",12
1609,Mrs Singh had now effectively become cut off from her children's education just as Balbinder had been cut off from local peer group relationships.,12
1610,"She occasionally contacted me, and for a Christmas present gave me a photograph of Balbinder taken at school and made into a calendar.",12
1611,"This showed him sitting at a desk, pencil in hand: his mother's vision of what school should be about.",12
1612,She and Mr Singh had visited the school for a Christmas event and had been pleased to hear that Balbinder was being moved into the second class.,12
1613,She had been worried that he was still playing too much and not learning anything.,12
1614,From January to July my contacts with the family were infrequent and concerned the progress of the two older boys.,12
1615,My advice was sought on several occasions when the family did not know how to cope with quite serious problems concerning the behaviour of one of them.,12
1616,Balbinder was a worry.,12
1617,"However, in July Mrs Singh phoned to ask whether I could go with her to Cedars' open evening.",12
1618,She wanted my opinion on Balbinder's progress.,12
1619,"I was not able to go with her, but, as I was the school's section XI teacher at the time, I arranged to visit on my own.",12
1620,"The section XI teacher, who had particular responsibility for Balbinder, said that he was the least of her worries.",12
1621,"He had been moved to a higher class, seemed well adjusted and chatted when she worked with him.",12
1622,His class teacher also felt that he was making progress.,12
1623,Both parents had come to the open evening and she had been able to talk to them.,12
1624,"They had also come to school earlier in the year for the annual assessment meeting, a statutory requirement for children who are the subject of Statements.",12
1625,"Looking back to her first encounter with Balbinder a year ago, when she had visited him at his previous school, she said that she had been shocked.",12
1626,He had been on the periphery of a large class and little attempt was being made to involve him in what was going on.,12
1627,She had felt at the time that he was ‘pretty borderline for special school’.,12
1628,"It seemed that in a school where he was in such a minority, his language and ethnicity had been defined as particular problems requiring the rather Draconian solution of Statementing.",12
1629,"His present class teacher and the section XI teacher both agreed that he was a slow learner, but felt that he did not exhibit the behavioural problems nor degrees of learning difficulty that characterised many of the children in the school.",12
1630,"This was borne out by observing him in the classroom, where he was sitting quietly working, in contrast with the much less controlled behaviour of other children in this small group.",12
1631,In this environment he appeared to have become a model pupil.,12
1632,"However, despite the small class and the specialist attention he was still considered far behind for a 7 year old.",12
1633,He could not read or write independently.,12
1634,"His written work, like both his brothers', was neat and controlled, consisting of short accounts of daily events which the teacher had transcribed and he had carefully illustrated and copied.",12
1635,The question of return to mainstream schooling was not being considered.,12
1636,"Later, talking to his teacher after a year and two terms at Cedars, it seemed that Balbinder's conversational language was developing well; he could hold his own in a small group often initiating topics of interest, describing, explaining and enquiring.",12
1637,"However, his teacher warned that proficiency in conversational language should not be assumed to equate with proficiency in cognitive or ‘academic’ language.",12
1638,"She reported on his ‘good imagination, something which shows up particularly in his drawings which always contain fine detail,.",12
1639,"mainstream education perhaps for the rest of his school career, Balbinder is defined as a problem.",12
1640,"His re-entry, however, either to mainstream or to the start of adult working life, may not be achieved so smoothly.",12
1641,The process of Statementing has disrupted his normal development.,12
1642,It has not taken into account the evident disjuncture between the cultural norms of his home and community and those of the school.,12
1643,In a more recent conversation with his mother she was still worried about him despite good reports from the school and the fact that ‘he now speaks both languages ’.,12
1644,"Her lack of contact with the school, the distance and her work made her feel helpless: ‘I can't rely on myself — I don't know — working all the time — how could I know.’",12
1645,Balbinder would be 8 at Christmas and she saw no evidence of the improvement in learning to read and write that she was hoping for.,12
1646,On being a client,12
1647,Conflicting perspectives on assessment,12
1648,Derrick Armstrong and David Galloway,12
1649,This chapter looks at the perceptions of parents of their role in the assessment of their child's special educational needs as part of the Statementing process carried out under the 1981 Education Act.,12
1650,The analysis is based on observations of professional — parent and professional — child interactions during the assessments of thirty children referred to the Schools Psychological Service in three LEAs because they were thought to have emotional and behavioural difficulties.,12
1651,In each case these observations were complemented by interviews held with the participants.,12
1652,INTRODUCTION: PERCEPTIONS DIFFER,12
1653,"Perhaps it is not surprising that, without exception, the professionals to whom we talked stated emphatically that their overriding concern was to act in the interests of their child clients.",12
1654,"Likewise, they expressed a desire to involve parents at the centre of decision-making.",12
1655,The former is consistent with the ethical codes of their professional associations (e.g. Association of Educational psychologists (1984) Members Handbook).,12
1656,"The latter, recommended by The Warnock Report (DES 1978), was established in law by the 1981 Education Act and supported by subsequent advice to professionals issued by the DES (1983, 1989).",12
1657,Does the 1981 Act assist or inhibit cooperation between professionals and parents?,12
1658,On face value the Act formalises a cooperative framework.,12
1659,"In practice, however, the bureaucratisation of the professional — parent relationship and the assessment process may lead to a situation in which the primary function of parental involvement is to legitimise professional decisions.",12
1660,Many parents felt that their own contribution to the assessment was only taken seriously when it supported what the professionals were saying.,12
1661,"On many occasions in our study we found a sharp contrast between the professionals' perception that a high degree of consensus had been reached and the parents' perception that they had agreed to a course of action because they saw no other real choice, particularly if the urgent needs of the child and other family members were to be quickly met.",12
1662,In the following section we use case history data to identify ways in which the professional — parent relationship operates within the context of the 1981 Act.,12
1663,This is followed by a discussion of the impact the 1981 Act has had on the notion of partnership.,12
1664,CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: THREE CASE STUDIES,12
1665,Each of the examples in this section illustrate the complexities which lie behind the definition of problem and special need by professionals in what they believe to be a collaborative relationship with parents.,12
1666,John: defining parents as part of ‘the problem',12
1667,Cooperation with parents may be made particularly difficult where the professional identifies a conflict of interests between parents and child.,12
1668,", the home situation may be seen as the single most important factor ‘causing’ the child's behaviour problems.",12
1669,"being seen as partners in the search for a solution parents may be seen as part of the problem (Moses and Croll 1987, Wood 1988).",12
1670,Because they are viewed in this light parents may respond with diffidence to those carrying out the assessment of their child and simply reflect back and reinforce professional perceptions.,12
1671,In John's case the stated reason for referral for formal assessment was his behaviour in school.,12
1672,"However, underlying this was his teachers' deeper concern that he might be a victim of physical and sexual abuse.",12
1673,The evidence these allegations was vague and in the event unsubstantiated despite in extensive Social Services investigation which ran parallel to the Statementing procedures.,12
1674,In drawing her conclusions about the family situation the head teacher pointed to the ‘fact’ that John's parents were only cooperative on the surface.,12
1675,‘Mum was initially cooperative…and Mr Peel was likewise ‘quite cooperative’’ until the decision was made to Statement…after that he opted out and didn't contact me.’,12
1676,"Mrs Peel, however, saw things differently, saying of the head, ‘She seemed to be assessing me John…it's like she's shifting the blame me…she used to speak to me like I was a really bad mother.",12
1677,I used to come home in tears.’,12
1678,"The school found some support for their interpretation of Mrs Peel's behaviour from a community nurse who tried to work with the family: ‘She thinks there's evidence of sexual abuse; soiling, language and sexually overt behaviour.’",12
1679,"the nurse, too, thought that the parents were uncooperative and that they were hiding something.",12
1680,She stated in her report: ‘On the occasions of visiting home I have felt most unwelcome and am therefore limited in the intervention I can provide.’,12
1681,She recommended that a meeting with Social Services would be helpful to alert them to the ‘dynamics’ of this family and to advise them that ‘as professionals we were anxious that we had not managed to engage and intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role’.,12
1682,Following the nurse's report a meeting was held with Social Services.,12
1683,Mrs Peel who was invited to attend:,12
1684,"All different people went in the meeting — the health visitor, the doctor, teachers — but I couldn't go in.",12
1685,When I was allowed in the child abuse officer was in the chair and he told me that his behaviour was the behaviour of a child who was being sexually abused.,12
1686,"They said they were not saying it was, but it was the behaviour.",12
1687,I went home in tears.,12
1688,They asked me to take the children for a full medical.,12
1689,"I didn't want to but I was frightened they would think it was true, so I let them do it.",12
1690,I felt because they couldn't come up with anything else they brought this up to show it was something it home…it's all been dropped now I think.,12
1691,From the perspectives of both professionals and parents the attempt to build a cooperative framework directed towards meeting John's needs had broken down.,12
1692,the professionals the breakdown happened because the parents were the cause of the child's special needs.,12
1693,"Consequently, cooperation was defined by the professionals in terms that allowed them, in the words of the community nurse, to ‘intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role’.",12
1694,The parents were expected to accept the authority of the professionals there is little evidence to support their judgement.,12
1695,The parents' sense of disempowerment was at this stage complete.,12
1696,Cooperation with the professionals required acceptance of the framework within which John's needs had been professionally cast: that it was their deficits as parents which had created John's needs.,12
1697,"On the other hand, refusal to cooperate would have been perceived by the professionals as reinforcing the latter's initial perceptions.",12
1698,"The definition of a problem, its source and the ‘needs, that arise from it are frequently established by professionals at an early stage and as we see here the parents, because they lack information and power, may find it very difficult to challenge such assumptions.",12
1699,"John's case also suggests how the perceptions of those professionals involved at an early stage of an assessment and the actions that follow may influence, direct or constrain the later perceptions and actions of other professionals.",12
1700,The educational psychologist (EP) expressed surprise that on every occasion he had met John the latter had always been attentive and cooperative but felt that ‘We have to accept what we are told about his behaviour by his teachers.’,12
1701,For this reason when the head teacher eventually excluded John permanently from school his behaviour the EP accepted that the school were acting reasonably in the circumstances and that they had made every effort with John.,12
1702,The EP observed that ‘John's language is so adult and behaviour so violent to other people that the school could not put up with it .’,12
1703,"On the other hand, the psychologist also recognised how the scope for his own intervention was restricted by the school's actions.",12
1704,‘The exclusion shuts doors possible recommendation.’,12
1705,"Likewise, the EP, after visiting the family on a number of occasions, said that the community nurse's impressions ‘don't ring true with my  own experience’.",12
1706,He also felt that the evidence of abuse was unconvincing but given the involvement of other agencies in this area it was beyond his remit to challenge it in compiling his advice for the Statement.,12
1707,Mrs Peel thought the EP to be more sympathetic than the other professionals she had encountered and that made it easier for her to convey her views to him.,12
1708,her experiences with those other professionals led her to believe that she could nut affect the result of their deliberations.,12
1709,She felt she had no power to determine or influence the decisions taken by the LEA and its professional advisers.,12
1710,To her the prospect of a Statement is ‘a load of rubbish.,12
1711,It's a legal document…but they've been telling me that all along.,12
1712,I get a bit of paper and it's more official but I still don't get anywhere.’,12
1713,However strongly she felt about the rights and wrongs of her situation she had no sense of power over its outcome.,12
1714,"George: who needs support?, what support is needed?",12
1715,"In this section, by looking at the case of George, we examine the interactive process and power relationships underlying the development of an apparent consensus.",12
1716,"We show how this consensus was identified as strong from the perspective of a professional, yet fragile and disempowering from the perspective of George's parents.",12
1717,George is a 9 year old attending a primary school in a working-class part of town.,12
1718,the head teacher ‘It may look very nice but we have a lot of difficult families and children.’,12
1719,George comes from a large family and the home situation is acknowledged by his parents to be stressful overcrowding and financial difficulties.,12
1720,One of George's brothers was recently placed in a residential school for children with moderate learning difficulties as a weekly boarder.,12
1721,"The family have experienced a lot of conflict with George's school and since moving home some twelve months ago have made efforts, unsuccessfully, to transfer their children to a different primary school.",12
1722,George was referred to the LEA for formal assessment under the Act on the grounds of emotional and behavioural difficulties as an ‘urgent case’.,12
1723,His teachers reported that the problem was ‘behaviour in class and at home’.,12
1724,"In school, George was described as ‘aggressive…he wanders about getting on with his work…he won't conform…he's like his brother…generally he disturbs other children.",12
1725,He disturbs their work.’,12
1726,Those behaviours were identified by his teachers as arising directly from the problems George faced in the home.,12
1727,At the outset the willingness of George's parents to cooperate with the school staff in discussing the home situation and how this might affect George's behaviour in school was used by the teaching staff as evidence their case that George's needs could not be met within a mainstream school.,12
1728,As the assessment progressed those two factors were at the forefront of the school's case to the educational psychologist:,12
1729,(a),12
1730,Disruptive behaviour in school.,12
1731,(b),12
1732,Management problems at home identified by the parents themselves.,12
1733,"We can see here how, at an early stage, the discourse of needs was established.",12
1734,The main feature of this discourse was that George's needs were conceptualised within the framework of the teachers' perceptions of their own needs: the threat George was seen as presenting to order and discipline within the school.,12
1735,The EP's role was seen by the teaching staff as being to advise the school.,12
1736,The EP was ‘brought in’ the teachers' perception that they lacked the skills to manage George's behaviour.,12
1737,"However, despite the way teachers represented their views Mr and Mrs Shod doubted the severity of the problem: ‘I don't think he's any worse than other kids — he's picked on by the school.’",12
1738,Their stated wish was for him to be moved to another mainstream school.,12
1739,the home situation their perspective was subtly and significantly different from that of the school.,12
1740,They acknowledged the stressfulness of the family situation but wanted help toward removing the stresses to have George removed from the home.,12
1741,It is important to recognise their willingness to consider residential school in this context.,12
1742,When it was suggested to them as a possibility it was understood by them as an opportunity for a breathing space .,12
1743,It was a of the parental perspective that was used by the professionals to legitimise the latter's recommendations.,12
1744,This is illustrated in the following exchange:,12
1745,: There used to be a place in Scotland where kids could go to give parents a break.,12
1746,I don't know if there's anything like that round here.,12
1747,You've got to think of the kids .,12
1748,They've never had any holiday.,12
1749,: I'll try to make some enquiries about holidays.,12
1750,I do feel that George will need some special schooling — he's not getting what he needs.,12
1751,Not anything to do with the school but he needs special help — I think we should think about your feelings.,12
1752,Let's try and get some help for you and the family.,12
1753,Thus the EP links parental desire for respite from family stress with the notion of special schooling.,12
1754,Once this link is established Mrs Shott is asked to consider a residential placement and the parents' own anxieties about their family situation and needs are used to justify the proposal being put forward.,12
1755,The different perspectives of EP and parents were reflected in the confusion over what had been decided at that meeting.,12
1756,The EP wrote in a memorandum to the LEA: ‘I feel that George would benefit from placement in a residential school for pupils with emotional and behavioural problems.,12
1757,Mr and Mrs Short would be happy with a weekly boarding place.’,12
1758,When questioned by a researcher Mr and Mrs Short restated their preference for a placement in an alternative mainstream school.,12
1759,They also reaffirmed their opposition to a residential school placement.,12
1760,: I couldn't handle George at weekends if he was away all week.,12
1761,":[referring to John, George's brother, who boards at an MLD school].",12
1762,It makes him worse.,12
1763,John says ‘You've sent me away and don't love me.’,12
1764,"Yet Mrs Short, despite her strongly held views, expressed resignation in playing little part in the decision-making process, a resignation based upon experience.",12
1765,‘We didn't bet much to do with John's assessment.,12
1766,I didn't want him to go to residential school .’,12
1767,The professionals were seen by Mrs Short as decision-makers and therefore when asked about the outcome of the meeting with the EP she was unclear because ‘I haven't been told.’,12
1768,"The parents believed, however, that the outcome of the assessment would be a placement in a special school whatever their own views.",12
1769,"In a later meeting between parents and psychologist the former, the psychologist's efforts to identify/impose a consensus, again attempted to articulate their own understanding of George's needs.",12
1770,: Last time I saw you we felt that we should be looking at some kind of school with weekly boarding.,12
1771,Mrs Short said she would prefer George to attend a mainstream school.,12
1772,: That's where you would like him to go?,12
1773,: Yes.,12
1774,: One possible school would be weekly boarding — if you visited there would be no guarantee.,12
1775,: To be honest with you we have one child already at one of those schools and when he comes home he's worse.,12
1776,The psychologist in a separate interview with the researcher expressed the belief that this ‘fact’ was evidence of the unsuitability of the home situation.,12
1777,This contrasted sharply with the parents' belief that the child's poor behaviour at home was a consequence of the latter perceiving himself to have been rejected by the family because he had been sent to a boarding school.,12
1778,The psychologist suggested that the parents themselves really wanted George to be placed in a residential school but did not wish to appear that they were rejecting him.,12
1779,‘They see residential school as an alternative to ‘care’ but it has less stigma for them.,12
1780,I think that's what they've really wanted all the way along.’,12
1781,The psychologist justified his own persuasive efforts with this belief that he was actually helping the parents to come to terms with a decision ‘’.,12
1782,: What I suggest we do — nothing's going to be decided today — I can arrange for you to have a look at one of these weekly residential schools — at this stage we're saying let's look.,12
1783,: That's OK.,12
1784,The validity of the psychologist's interpretation of parental motives in this case is  difficult to assess.,12
1785,In the end it depends upon ‘professional judgement’.,12
1786,"it is correct, it quite clearly differs from the parents' explicit account of their perception of how the decision has been reached and the implications it will have for George.",12
1787,: As far as I'm concerned they give up too soon.,12
1788,: The way they were talking at that meeting George is going to residential school.,12
1789,It's going to make him worse.,12
1790,Tom: refusing to play the game,12
1791,Our third example focuses upon conflicting perceptions of the purpose of assessment under the 1981 Act and the relationship between information and control.,12
1792,It raises questions about how the Act itself can become a controlling force to limit parental action.,12
1793,Twelve months ago Tom had been placed two half-days each week in an off-site unit for disruptive children.,12
1794,"This placement followed the breakup of his parents' marriage which was acknowledged by his mother, but not his father, as having a serious effect upon Tom's behaviour.",12
1795,After the breakup the parents were awarded joint custody and Tom resided for part of the week with each.,12
1796,Mrs Jones felt that this arrangement was itself disruptive and should be changed.,12
1797,Mr Jones did not agree.,12
1798,He felt that Tom caused him no problems and it was Tom's relationship with his mother that was at the root of the difficulties he had.,12
1799,Tom had recently been referred by his mainstream school to the psychological Service for assessment under the 1981 Act because teachers felt they should receive additional support for Tom's periods in mainstream school.,12
1800,The EP in this case felt that even more drastic measures might be required.,12
1801,"In his view Tom was being used as a pawn in the relationship between his parents and unless his parents did come to an arrangement whereby ‘a more stable home situation’ was provided, Tom would benefit from a residential school placement.",12
1802,Tom's mother was highly critical of the way the mainstream school was handling him but agreed to the assessment because she felt it might help him.,12
1803,Initially she welcomed the professionals' involvement because she believed this might result in help and advice in identifying the reasons for Tom's deteriorating behaviour.,12
1804,Once the assessment had begun Mrs Jones soon became disillusioned.,12
1805,She complained bitterly about the lack of information she was receiving.,12
1806,Perhaps this reflected a lack of clarity about the purpose of the assessment and the conflicting expectations participants held of its outcome.,12
1807,Mrs Jones expected feedback and dialogue about the development of an intervention strategy.,12
1808,When she later challenged the EP she was told she should have contacted the Education Welfare Officer (EWO) designated by the LEA as being the ‘named person’.,12
1809,She couldn't recollect having been informed of this.,12
1810,"In any case she had not expected that her role in the assessment would be limited to receiving information back from an  EWO: ‘We didn't ask for it [the assessment]— it was the education system who said it should be done — if I accept them into my home I don't expect them to disappear for twelve months, if they invited themselves in.’",12
1811,Mrs Jones felt that the slow progress of the assessment and the limited information she received created new problems resolving existing ones: ‘It introduces so much trauma — you're getting all the criticism all the time but you're not getting any information because it takes so long.’,12
1812,"Access to information, however, was not the only problem Mrs Jones faced.",12
1813,A lack of common agreement over the objectives of the assessment was something Mrs Jones had not anticipated.,12
1814,"Whereas she had seen the assessment as a way of addressing Tom's unsettled home situation, establishing an objective base line from which she and her ex-husband could identify how their differences were affecting Tom, the EP refused to become involved in this area.",12
1815,‘It's difficult if I'm to remain neutral.’,12
1816,Yet the EP was willing to use this dispute as a justification for his recommendation for residential schooling.,12
1817,", Mrs Jones was dissatisfied that little attention appeared to have been given to Tom's problems in school.",12
1818,She had been told on one occasion by the EP that Tom's behaviour problems might have been the result of frustration over reading difficulties.,12
1819,"She had found this information to be very positive ‘because they can focus on dealing with it now, it spells out a lot of hope’.",12
1820,Yet she felt little had been done to address this problem in school and if in these circumstances she now accepted residential school she would be giving up on Tom.,12
1821,the EP continued to recommend residential schooling.,12
1822,Mrs Jones's response was ‘No way am I going to agree with that.’,12
1823,"On the other hand, on a different occasion she expressed feelings of depression and powerlessness in the face of professional opinion, conceding that she might allow him to go to residential school if it could be shown that it was in his best interests.",12
1824,Once the EP had recommended residential schooling in his report Mrs Jones expressed little confidence in her ‘rights’ under the law.,12
1825,But she remained determined to play an equal part in defining the nature of her child's needs.,12
1826,She had seen the initial stage of the assessment process as an opportunity to enhance her role in the decision-making but saw it as restricting her power.,12
1827,She therefore decided to abandon reliance on official procedures.,12
1828,"She moved house and with the cooperation of the new local head teacher changed Tom's mainstream school, and withdrew him from the off-site unit.",12
1829,The EP and LEA were now presented with a .,12
1830,Mrs Jones they had little option in the circumstances but to allow her decision a ‘chance to fail’.,12
1831,DISCUSSION: DISEMPOWERMENT BY PARTNERSHIP,12
1832,The 1981 Education Act clearly states the procedures that must be followed to maximise parental involvement in the decision-making process.,12
1833,It identifies the range of information that must be made available to parents and the right of  parents to contribute their own advice and evidence to the assessment.,12
1834,"Moreover, procedures are established for parents to seek clarification, state objections and appeal against recommendations.",12
1835,A strong case can be put forward to demonstrate that no decision can be taken without full consultation with parents and due deference to their views.,12
1836,In practice there is increasing evidence that the rights of parents under the Act are not always given prominence.,12
1837,A number of commentators have suggested that once the assessment procedures have been initiated parents become increasingly marginalised in the process.,12
1838,"Dyson (1986), , drew attention to the ways in which professionals' confidential files often contain materials contributing to the social stereotyping of children and their families.",12
1839,This information might be circulated informally amongst professionals but parents remain ignorant of its existence.,12
1840,Chaudhury (1986) and Rehal (1989) identified how parents of ethnic minority children may be disadvantaged during special needs assessments by the failure of LEAs and professionals to take account of language and cultural factors.,12
1841,Goacher .,12
1842,(1988) found marked differences between LEAs in the role parents are allowed to play.,12
1843,‘It seems certain that even the small change in the balance of power between professionals and parents brought about by the Act have yet to be realized in a number of Authorities’(Goacher .,12
1844,1988: 59).,12
1845,It might be suggested that the disempowerment of parents arises from a combination of LEAs seeking to maintain control over the distribution of resources and professionals seeking to secure the autonomy of their professional role.,12
1846,"Yet we can find evidence of LEAs taking their responsibilities under the Act for involving parents very seriously, presenting information and reports in ways designed to make the assessment meaningful and accessible to parents.",12
1847,", even in these cases parents may find the concepts of ‘disclosure’ and ‘involvement’to operate implicitly as disempowering forces.",12
1848,Mittler and Mittler (1982) make a similar point when they argue that a clear distinction should be drawn between the concepts of ‘partnership’ and ‘involvement’.,12
1849,"Whilst the former emphasises the sharing of power expertise, the latter contains an implicit assumption of professional expertise and control.",12
1850,"Swann (1987) has argued that segregated provision exists, a means to select and allocate children will be needed.",12
1851,"This, he suggests, is the main purpose of Statementing.",12
1852,Because Statementing is concerned with the allocation of resources with the identification of needs strict limits are placed on the power of parents to affect the Statementing process.,12
1853,If Swann is correct the identification of needs will be resource-led.,12
1854,"The 1981 Act itself may be read as implicitly setting out this principle, and Galloway and Goodwin (1987) have demonstrated its operation in practice.",12
1855,"As Swann (1987) argues, without the power to make decisions about resources, parent involvement within the 1981 Act is concerned ‘with recruiting parents as resources in the education of their children, pursuing goals defined by professionals’(Swann 1987: 193).",12
1856,The way in which the concept of ‘need’ is defined by the 1981 Act may also  serve to reinforce the limits on parental power.,12
1857,The Act abolished the ten categories of handicap identified under the 1945 Handicapped pupils and School Health Regulations (DES 1945) and replaced them with the concept of ‘special educational need’.,12
1858,‘Need’ was redefined learning difficulties significantly greater than those of the majority of children.,12
1859,This shifted the conceptual focus needs as defined the child's handicap towards educational needs arising from learning difficulties.,12
1860,", there remains a focus upon the child as having needs upon the situation as creating needs (Oliver 1988).",12
1861,"An important implication of this is that while a particular situation may give rise to various differing, and sometimes conflicting needs (the needs of teachers, parents, other pupils, the LEA and indeed the LEA's professional advisers), the conceptual focus upon the child encouraged by the Act inhibits the development of a theoretical framework within which the interplay of needs can be examined.",12
1862,"On the other hand, psychologists frequently have the task of mediating between the needs and interests of the different participants involved with the child and their key role in the decision-making process.",12
1863,Despite the ‘rights’ parents are given under the Act this is a form of power that parents are rarely able to exercise.,12
1864,Parental involvement in decision-making is often restricted to identifying those aspects of the child's behaviour that fit or do not fit with the views of the professionals.,12
1865,"Parents are marginalised, not because professionals deliberately exclude them but because they are denied the opportunity to influence how need is conceptualised.",12
1866,"Moreover, in practice, they may lack the power to negotiate on equal terms with professionals about the interrelationship between the needs of different participants in the assessment.",12
1867,By conceptualising the child's needs in a way that fails to acknowledge the significance of this wider context the Act reinforces and legitimises the disempowerment of parents.,12
1868,We can see how this occurred in our first two case studies.,12
1869,In both cases the parents' resignation to the inevitability of the assessment outcome arose from their having no opportunity to determine or seriously influence the objectives of the assessment nor to contribute to the conceptual framework within which their children's needs were being assessed.,12
1870,In the third case Mrs Jones refused to accept the proposals put forward by the professionals for meeting Tom's needs.,12
1871,Whereas she had welcomed the assessment she later came to the view that she was being given no say in the objectives of the assessment.,12
1872,"She, too, felt that she was denied the opportunity to make a genuine contribution, the professionals, to the understanding of Tom's needs and the circumstances in which they were being created.",12
1873,"Ultimately, this led her to challenge the way the professionals conceived Tom's needs.",12
1874,"In her eyes, she could only do so by stepping outside the framework imposed by the Act.",12
1875,Her direct challenge to the authority of the professionals forced them to acknowledge an alternative conceptualisation of Tom's needs which carried with it quite different implications for the outcome of the formal assessment of those needs.,12
1876,her action outside the assessment  procedures also gave Mrs Jones the power to negotiate with other participants.,12
1877,By securing the support of the head teacher and staff of a different mainstream school she was able to place her opposition to a recommendation for residential schooling on a firm footing and insist that her understanding of Tom's needs be tested in practice.,12
1878,Thus Mrs Jones's power inside the assessment process was increased by her having identified and pursued sources of strength outside that process.,12

2,"t If so-called ‘so-called poststructuralism’ is the product of a single historical moment, then that moment is probably not May 1968 but rather the Algerian War of Independence — itself both a symptom and a product.",13
3,"In this respect it is significant that Sartre, Althusser, Derrida and Lyotard, among others, were all either born in Algeria or personally involved with the events of the war.",13
4,But let us begin instead with Héléne Cixous's remarkable account of what it was like to grow up as an Algerian French Jewish girl at that time:,13
5,"I learned everything from this first spectacle: I saw how the white (French), superior, plutocratic, civilized world founded its power on the repression of populations who had suddenly become ‘invisible’, like proletarians, immigrant workers, minorities who are not the right ‘colour’.",13
6,Women.,13
7,Invisible as humans.,13
8,"But, , perceived as tools — dirty, stupid, lazy, underhanded, etc.",13
9,some annihilating dialectical magic.,13
10,"I saw that the great, noble, ‘advanced’ countries established themselves by expelling what was ‘strange’; excluding it but not dismissing it; enslaving it.",13
11,A commonplace gesture of History: there have to be two races — the masters and the slaves.,13
12,Cixous has been criticized for lacking a politics and a theory of the social.,13
13,"some criteria perhaps, but if so they would have to exclude from ‘the political, considerations those described here.",13
14,"Which is precisely the point: if there is a politics to what has become known as poststructuralism, then it is articulated in this passage which unnervingly weaves capitalist economic exploitation, racism, colonialism, sexism, together with, perhaps unexpectedly, ‘History’ and the structure of the Hegelian dialectic.",13
15,"A lot has been said already in the English-speaking world about poststructuralism and politics, much of it in the accusatory mode voiced from the opposing class-based verities of ‘tradition’ or ‘History’.",13
16,Such apparently secure grounds of objection amount to two narratives; their intriguing similarity brings out the extent to which poststructuralism challenges not  just the politics and institutions of the right but also the politics and theoretical systems of the left.,13
17,"Disturbing conventional assumptions about what constitutes ‘the political’, poststructuralism is correspondingly difficult to place itself.",13
18,In the passage just cited it is striking that Cixous includes the Hegelian dialectic in the forms of political oppression which she describes.,13
19,It is not a question of showing that such an allegation misinterprets or simplifies Hegel's texts.,13
20,it does.,13
21,"The problem involves rather the ways in which Hegel has been read, absorbed and adapted.",13
22,"Nor is it just the Hegelian dialectic as such: Cixous includes ‘History’, and by implication therefore Marxism .",13
23,"This cannot simply be dismissed as another New Right invocation of the Gulag, for Cixous is arguing something much more specific: that Marxism, it inherits the system of the Hegelian dialectic, is also implicated in the link between the structures of knowledge and the forms of oppression of the last two hundred years: a phenomenon that has become known as Eurocentrism.",13
24,"To this extent, Marxism's universalizing narrative of the unfolding of a rational system of world history is simply a negative form of the history of European imperialism: it was Hegel, after all, who declared that ‘Africa has no history’, and it was Marx who, though critical of British imperialism, concluded that the British colonization of India was ultimately for the best because it brought India into the evolutionary narrative of Western history, thus creating the conditions for future class struggle there.",13
25,"Such an arrogant and arrogating narrative means that the story of ‘world history’ not only involves what Fredric Jameson describes as the wresting of freedom from the realm of necessity but always also the creation, subjection and final appropriation of Europe's ‘others’.",13
26,"This is why ‘History’, which for Marxism promises liberation, for Cixous also entails another forgotten story of oppression:",13
27,"Already I know all about the ‘reality’ that supports History's progress: everything throughout the centuries depends on the distinction between the Selfsame, the ownself…and that which limits it: so now what menaces my-own-good…is the ‘other’.",13
28,What is the ‘Other’?,13
29,"If it is truly the ‘other’, there is nothing to say; it cannot be theorized.",13
30,The ‘other’ escapes me.,13
31,"It is elsewhere, outside: absolutely other.",13
32,It doesn't settle down.,13
33,"But in History, , what is called, other' is an alterity that does settle down, that falls into the dialectical circle.",13
34,"It is the other in a hierarchically organized relationship in which the same is what rules, names, defines, and assigns ‘its’ other.",13
35,"With the dreadful simplicity that orders the movement Hegel erected as a system, society trots along before my eyes reproducing to perfection the mechanism of the death struggle: the reduction of a ‘person, to a ‘nobody’ to the position of ‘other’— the inexorable plot of racism.",13
36,"There has to be some ‘other’— no master  without a slave, no economico-political power without exploitation, no dominant class without cattle under the yoke, no ‘Frenchmen’ without wogs, no Nazis without Jews, no property without exclusion — an exclusion that has its limits and is part of the dialectic.",13
37,(70–1),13
38,Not that Hegel himself is responsible.,13
39,"Rather the problem, Cixous argues, is that unfortunately Hegel wasn't inventing things.",13
40,"The entire Hegelian machinery simply lays down the operation of a system already in place, already operating in everyday life.",13
41,"Politics and knowledge have worked the same Hegelian dialectic, with its ‘phallo-logocentric ’— whether it be Marxism's History, Europe's colonial annexations and accompanying racism or orientalist scholarship, or, in a typical conflation of patriarchy and colonialism, Freud's characterization of femininity as the dark unexplored continent (’ within his economy, she is the strangeness he likes to appropriate' [68]).",13
42,"For even Freud, Cixous, has not helped in any project to separate history from the history of appropriation or that of phallocentrism.",13
43,The patriarchal structures of psychoanalytic theory have often been defended on the grounds that they only describe the current customs of a patriarchal society.,13
44,"But this does not alter the fact that psychoanalysis therefore repeats the same masculine ‘Empire of the Selfsame’, and that such descriptions become institutionalized — as a structure of knowledge, or as psychoanalytic practice — then they become agents of the system they describe.",13
45,The point is to change it.,13
46,But why this emphasis on Hegel?,13
47,"The problem of the Hegelian model, particularly of a historicism which presupposes a governing structure of self-realization in all historical process, is confined to post-war French Marxism, but the dominance of Hegelian Marxism from the thirties to the fifties does explain the particular context for the French poststructuralist assault.",13
48,"Here it is not a question of suggesting that Hegel is somehow answerable for the excesses of capitalism or even socialism in the past two hundred years: rather what is at stake is the argument that the dominant force of opposition to capitalism, Marxism, as a body of knowledge itself remains complicit with, and even extends, the system to which it is opposed.",13
49,Hegel articulates a philosophical structure of the appropriation of the other as a form of knowledge which uncannily simulates the project of nineteenth-century imperialism; the construction of knowledges which all operate through forms of expropriation and incorporation of the other mimics it a conceptual level the geographical and economic absorption of the non-European world by the West.,13
50,"Marxism's standing Hegel on his head may have reversed his idealism, but it did not change the mode of operation of a conceptual system which remains collusively Eurocentric.",13
51,It is thus entirely appropriate that Hegelian Marxism has become generally known as ‘Western Marxism’.,13
52,"As Cixous suggests, the mode of knowledge as a politics of arrogation  pivots at a theoretical level on the dialectic of the same and the other.",13
53,"Such knowledge is always centred in a self it is outward looking, searching for power and control of what is other to it.",13
54,"Anthropology has always provided the clearest symptomatic instance, as was foreseen by Rousseau from the outset.",13
55,"History, with a capital H, similarly cannot tolerate otherness or leave it outside its economy of inclusion.",13
56,"The appropriation of the other as a form of knowledge within a totalizing system can thus be set alongside the history (if not the project) of European imperialism, and the constitution of the other as ‘other’ alongside racism and sexism.",13
57,The reaction against this structure has produced forms of politics that do not fit into traditional political categories.,13
58,"Here the problem rests on the fact that for orthodox Marxism there can be only one ‘other’, that of the working class, into which all other oppressed groups, so-called ‘minorities’, must in the last instance be subsumed.",13
59,Such a position is confined to a Marxism of a Stalinist past.,13
60,"In , published in 1987, , Alex Callinicos argues that the so-called poststructuralist critique of the category of the subject can be avoided by shifting the subject the problematic realm of consciousness into a theory of human agency.",13
61,"This provides something closer to historical Marxism, although it does mean that he quickly becomes involved in assumptions about rationality and intentionality, and has to propose a ‘principle of Humanity’, that is a common human nature, to hold them all together.",13
62,"Perhaps not unexpectedly, the ‘Principle of Humanity’ also turns out to involve the assumption that class is the primary form of collective agency, because, we are told, it is more fundamental than any other interests or forms of social power.",13
63,Callinicos writes:,13
64,Feminists and black nationalists [sic]often complain that the concepts of Marxist class theory are ‘gender-blind’ and ‘race-blind’.,13
65,This is indeed true.,13
66,"Agents' class position derives from their place in production relations, not their gender or supposed race.",13
67,"But of itself this does not provide grounds for rejecting Marxism, since its chief theoretical claim is precisely to explain power-relations and forms of conflict those denoted by the terms ‘nation’, ‘gender’ and ‘race’the forces and relations of production.",13
68,"The mere existence of national, sexual and racial oppression does not refute historical materialism, but rather constitutes its .",13
69,The only interesting question is Marxism can actually explain these phenomena.,13
70,The only interesting question?,13
71,"So gender and race can be satisfactorily subordinated to class then Marxism does not need refuting, and history can be reasserted as the single narrative of the Third International.",13
72,"Conversely, as Callinicos implicitly recognizes, the problem with  contemporary politics for the left is that the dialectic of class depends on a historicist History and ; any failure of the former necessarily also involves a waning of the latter.",13
73,Marxism's inability to deal with the political interventions of other oppositional groups has meant that its History can claim to subsume all processes of change.,13
74,"The straightforward oppositional structure of capital and class does not necessarily work any more: if we think Hegel's master/slave dialectic, then the working class being the obvious universal subject-victim, many others are also oppressed: particularly women, black people, and all other so-called ethnic and minority groups.",13
75,"Any single individual may belong to several of these, but the forms of oppression, resistance or change, may not only overlap but may also differ or even conflict.",13
76,"there is a single master and no single slave, then the classic Hegelian reversal model on which Marxism depends and on which it bases its theory of revolution (literally, an overturning) is adequate.",13
77,In fact it is arguable whether such dualistic conditions ever existed anyway: marginal groups which could not be assimilated into the category of the working class were merely relegated by Marx to the .,13
78,"Even the formulation of a dualistic class division, Laclau and Mouffe have argued persuasively, is itself nothing less than a nostalgic attempt to recreate for the nineteenth century the imagined simplicity of the conditions of the aristocracy/bourgeoisie conflict of the French Revolution which had originally inspired Hegel.",13
79,"A similarly straightforward opposition also provides much of the attraction which has fuelled the recent growth of interest in the historical analysis of colonialism — in which you apparently have the simple binary of master and slave, colonizer and colonized.",13
80,"With colonialism it's easy to tell the good guys from the bad guys, which makes it tempting to substitute the colonized for the lost working class.",13
81,Already in 1957 Roland Barthes was claiming that ‘today it is the colonized peoples who assume the full ethical and political condition described by Marx as being that of the proletariat’.,13
82,"But politics today are much more complex, much more difficult to disentangle.",13
83,The dialectical structure of oppositional politics works for the micro-politics of the post-war period in the West.,13
84,"This is the context of Foucault's critique of what he calls the sovereign model of power, of the idea that power has a single source in a master, king, or class — and can thus easily be reversed.",13
85,"This shift from a conflictual dyadic political structure is not simply a question of historical change, of the recent appearance of ‘minorities’: after all the slave was already constituted simultaneously different groups (male or female), the always had to be excluded.",13
86,"The problem begins at a conceptual level with the initial division between master and slave as such, relations of power work the binary opposition of Hegel's fight to the death between two individuals.",13
87,"This structure is not, as might be imagined, derived from a fantasy of power relations modelled on a medieval joust but from the phenomenological account of the constitution of knowledge that works the structure of a subject perceiving an object, a same/other dialectic in which the other is first constituted by the same through its negation as other before being incorporated within it.",13
88,No possibility of dialogue or exchange here.,13
89,"As Cixous argues, nor can there be any place in this schema for the other as other, unless it becomes, like God, an absolute other, literally unknowable.",13
90,"The difficulties which arise from this structure are familiar from the debates in feminism, where, woman, seems to be offered an alternative of either being the ‘other’ as constituted by man, , conforming to the stereotypes of patriarchy, or, if she is to avoid this, of being an absolute ‘other’outside knowledge, necessarily confined to inarticulate expressions of mysticism or .",13
91,"The only way to side-step these alternatives seems to be to reject the other altogether and become the same, , equal to men — but then with no difference from them.",13
92,Exactly the same double bind is encountered in any theorization of racial difference.,13
93,"In his influential Vincent Descombes has described the entire history of twentieth-century philosophy in France as a succession of moves which attempt to get this Hegelian dialectic: the recent phenomenon of poststructuralism is part of a long philosophical story and distinguished only by what appears to be a certain success, or an avoidance of failure to the extent that it has managed to keep the game with Hegel in play.",13
94,"The real difficulty has always been to find an alternative to the Hegelian dialectic — difficult because strictly speaking it is impossible, the operation of the dialectic already includes its negation.",13
95,"You cannot get Hegel by simply contradicting him, any more than you can get those other Hegelian systems, Marxism and psychoanalysis, by simply opposing them: for in both your opposition is likewise always recuperable, as the workings of ideology or psychic resistance.",13
96,"Nor can you get Hegel by simply removing him, like the excision of Trotsky from the side of Lenin in certain official Soviet photographs.",13
97,This is the lesson of Althusser.,13
98,"Althusser's historical interest derives from the fact that he represents the only orthodox Marxist theorist who has tried to get Hegel while remaining a Marxist — though for many Marxists he did sacrifice Marxism in the process, which only suggests how closely Marxism and Hegelianism are intertwined.",13
99,"Althusser's theoretical interest, on the other hand, is that he demonstrates the impossibility of any attempt simply to exclude, excise or extirpate Hegel.",13
100,Other strategies are required.,13
101,II HISTORICISM AND IMPERIALISM,13
102,"Metaphysics — the white mythology which reassembles and reflects the culture of the West: the white man takes his own mythology, Indo-European mythology, his own , , the of his idiom, for the universal form of that he must still wish to call Reason.",13
103,Jacques Derrida,13
104,"If poststructuralism has involved an attempted disruption or reworking of Hegelianism through the detection of its own fissures, it is not by any means unique in such an enterprise.",13
105,"For, as Foucault argued in 1978, the work of the Frankfurt School could also be regarded as a reassessment of Hegelianism and the metaphysics of dialectical thought.",13
106,"However, it is too simplistic a reaction to suggest that French poststructuralism can therefore be invalidated by judging it against the claims of a comparable endeavour in Germany, a procedure which can only operate by turning the former into a failed version of the latter, which obviously leaves open the possibility of exactly the reverse argument being made.",13
107,"Though the two may have isolated similar problems, the political and intellectual context of their work was the same.",13
108,The key Frankfurt School text in this regard is obviously Horkheimer and Adorno's of 1944.,13
109,"The date, and the exiled place of composition of its authors, suggests tellingly that the situation with which it attempts to deal is the phenomenon of fascism which seemed to have stopped in its tracks the long march of the progress of reason, and its liberating enlightenment ideals, of which Marxism was the fullest political development.",13
110,Horkheimer and Adorno therefore pose the question: how has the dialectic deviated into fascism?,13
111,Why has History gone wrong?,13
112,"Their answer, briefly, was that reason had always contained a measure of irrationality, which, despite its best intentions, had led to its involvement with tyranny and domination: ‘Enlightenment is totalitarian’.",13
113,The very powers of rationality which enabled modern man to free himself from nature and control it had also become an instrumental device to dominate him.,13
114,"If nature had been modelled by man into productive commodities, man's own subjectivity had also become reified into a self-identical instrument; man had become an empty and passive consumer.",13
115,"The project, therefore, was to return to the enlightenment in the wake of fascism, to excise the forms of instrumental rationality that had produced this self-defeating and, ironically, irrational dialectical structure of domination, and to redefine reason and the forms of identity thinking that had defined the individual simply as an indistinguishable element in the collective.",13
116,In this way the autonomy and spontaneity of the individual subject that had been the original goal of enlightenment might be retrieved.,13
117,"If for the Frankfurt School the problem to be dealt with was the relation of the phenomena of fascism, and particularly Auschwitz, to the ideals of the enlightenment and the progress of reason, for the French  poststructuralists the historical perspective was similarly long.",13
118,"But it comprised, rather, a history of the West in which fascism was itself merely a symptom, and included not only the history of European imperialism but also the defeats of the European colonial powers by Japan in World War II, the subsequent French (and American) defeat in South-East Asia, the war in Algeria, the many other colonial wars of national liberation.",13
119,"From this point of view the French have never regarded fascism as an aberration, concurring rather with Césaire and Fanon that it can be explained quite simply as European colonialism brought home to Europe by a country that had been deprived of its overseas empire after World War I. French poststructuralism, therefore, involves a critique of reason as a system of domination comparable to that of the Frankfurt School, but setting up the possibility of a purged reason operating in an unblocked, ideal speech situation as a defence against tyranny and coercion in the manner of a Habermas, it reanalyses the operations of reason as such.",13
120,"Here the focus is placed not so much upon the continued presence of irrationality, for irrationality after all is simply reason's own excluded but necessary negative other, but rather on the possibility of other logics being imbricated within reason which might serve to undo its own tendency to domination.",13
121,Here we have a major difference from the historical pessimism of Adorno's negative dialectics which in certain respects poststructuralism might appear to resemble.,13
122,"Another such project was initiated by Adorno's contemporary Jean-Paul Sartre, whose attempt to define a new form of Hegelian Marxism via a reworked philosophy of consciousness in many ways more closely resembled that of the Frankfurt School.",13
123,"In both cases revisionary work of this kind was embodied in a historical and political analysis of the relation of individual consciousness to society, from within the aegis of an Hegelian Marxism in some respects still impossibly bound to its own enlightenment heritage.",13
124,"This meant that Adorno tended to project science as something exterior and exclusively instrumental; he reacted against it, ‘objective’ reason generally, by trying to retrieve the individual subject as the means to salvation.",13
125,"In France, however, there also existed a very different tradition, that of the history of the sciences, a tradition in which Foucault has placed himself.",13
126,"Having been overshadowed since the war by Sartrean Marxism, in the crises of the 1960s it emerged as the more influential of the two.",13
127,"Foucault traces its history back to Husserl's (1929) and the (1936)— in which Husserl ‘posed the question of the relations between the ‘Western’ project of a universal deployment of reason,[and]the positivity of the sciences and the radicality of philosophy'.",13
128,This enabled the establishment of a critical position science which for Adorno remained so elusive.,13
129,"In larger terms, however, the questions posed in the French tradition were  comparable to those of the Frankfurt School, particularly the interrogation of rationality in its claims to universality.",13
130,As Foucault puts it:,13
131,"In the history of the sciences in France, as in German critical theory, it is a matter at bottom of examining a reason, the autonomy of whose structures carries with it a history of dogmatism and despotism — a reason, consequently, which can only have an effect of emancipation on condition that it manages to liberate itself from itself.",13
132,(54),13
133,"The final emancipatory gesture of enlightenment thought would thus be its own liberation from itself, it is recognizable as reason.",13
134,But what was it that brought about the return of the question of the enlightenment to contemporary philosophical enquiry?,13
135,"Foucault identifies three reasons: first of all the ever-increasing importance of technology, secondly the place of rationalism in the optimism attached to the notion of ‘revolution’— as well as in the despotism that so often followed its realization — and thirdly:",13
136,"the movement which, at the close of the colonial era, led it to be asked of the West what entitles its culture, its science, its social organization, and finally its rationality itself, to be able to claim universal validity: was this not a mirage associated with economic domination and political hegemony?",13
137,"Two centuries later, the Enlightenment returns: but not as a way for the West to take cognizance of its present possibilities and of the liberties to which it can have access, but as a way of interrogating it on its limits and on the powers which it has abused.",13
138,Reason as despotic enlightenment.,13
139,(54),13
140,"Foucault's account is particularly useful it gives a good indication of the characteristic French, German, emphasis on the relation of Marxism to enlightenment rationality and the questioning of enlightenment claims to the universality of its values.",13
141,"The first element, the role of science, is common to both, though they approach the question from opposite perspectives.",13
142,"The second, the role of enlightenment thinking in the subsequent history of European despotism, is the particular focus of interest for the German critical theorists, most memorably and most forcibly articulated in Benjamin's ‘Theses on the Philosophy of History’.",13
143,"It is the third element, however, which represents the special interest of the French, whether of the Sartrean or Foucauldian tradition: the relation of the enlightenment, its grand projects and universal truth-claims, to the history of European colonialism.",13
144,"This need not necessarily involve a direct analysis of the effects of colonialism as such, but can also consist of a relentless anatomization of the collusive forms of European knowledge.",13
145,"For Foucault this has comprised a vigorous critique of historicism, including Marxist historicism, and its relation to the operations of knowledge and power.",13
146,"It is from this perspective that it becomes possible to understand the basis of the distrust of totalizing systems of knowledge which depend upon theory and  concepts, so characteristic of Foucault or Lyotard, both of whom have been predominantly concerned with the attempt to isolate and foreground singularity universality.",13
147,"This quest for the singular, the contingent event which by definition refuses all conceptualization, can clearly be related to the project of constructing a form of knowledge that respects the other without absorbing it into the same.",13
148,It is in the work of Edward Said that we can find the problematic of historicist forms of knowledge linked most forcibly to the question of European imperialism.,13
149,He writes:,13
150,"So far as Orientalism and European knowledge of other societies have been concerned, historicism meant that one human history uniting humanity either culminated in or was observed from the vantage point of Europe, or the West…",13
151,"What…has never taken place is an epistemological critique at the most fundamental level of the connection between the development of a historicism which has expanded and developed enough to include antithetical attitudes ideologies of Western imperialism and critiques of imperialism on the one hand, and on the other, the actual practice of imperialism by which the accumulation of territories and population, the control of economies, and the incorporation and homogenisation of histories are maintained.",13
152,"This was the difficult project of his own book,(1978), which we shall later be examining in detail.",13
153,"For the moment let us focus on Said's subsequent point that if Orientalism and anthropology derive from historicism, this is a thing of the past: of more recent sciences, Said singles out that of world history as practised by Braudel, Wallerstein, Anderson and Wolf, which he contends is still derived from the enterprise of Orientalism and its colluding companion anthropology, and which has refused to encounter and to interrogate its own relationship as a discipline to European imperialism.",13
154,"For Said, the problem amounts simply to historicism and, the universalising and self-validating that has been endemic to it':",13
155,"the theories of accumulation on a world scale, or the capitalist world state, or lineages of absolutism depend (a) on the same displaced percipient and historicist observer who had been an Orientalist or colonial traveller three generations ago;(b) they depend also on a homogenising and incorporating world historical scheme that assimilated non-synchronous developments, histories, cultures, and peoples to it; and (c) they block and keep down latent epistemological critiques of the institutional, cultural and disciplinary instruments linking the incorporative practice of world history with partial knowledges like Orientalism on the one hand, and on the other, with continued ‘Western’ hegemony of the non-European, peripheral world.",13
156,(22),13
157,"A new type of knowledge, Said contends, must be produced that can analyse plural objects as such offering forms of integrated understanding that simply comprehend them within totalizing schemas.",13
158,"Already across a wide range of different activities he points to advances in the process of ‘breaking up, dissolving and methodologically critically reconceiving the unitary field ruled hitherto by Orientalism, historicism, and what could be called essentialist universalism’.",13
159,"In this last phrase, Said thus links his critique of Orientalism to other critiques, those of racism or of patriarchy.",13
160,The more difficult question remains of what form this new kind of knowledge can take.,13
161,Here we return to the theoretical problem of how the other can be articulated as such.,13
162,"How can we represent other cultures? asks Said, as Lévi-Strauss had done before him.",13
163,His own dismissal of deconstruction as a merely textual practice means that he is himself at a loss when faced with the complex conceptual dialectics of the same and the other.,13
164,"As will be demonstrated itself, Said cannot get the Hegelian problematic that he articulates, and indeed tends himself to repeat the very processes that he criticizes.",13
165,"His advocacy of an analytic pluralism in itself does not solve, or even address, the conceptual problems.",13
166,"Nevertheless, Said's comments suggest the wider significance of his project.",13
167,"The demise of an orthodox Marxism may have left theory with a sense that everything is now in flux, that the old verities have gone, but it has also involved the important realization, articulated so forcibly by writers Foucault or Said, of the deep articulation of knowledge with power.",13
168,"The politics of poststructuralism forces the recognition that all knowledge may be variously contaminated, implicated in its very formal or ‘objective, structures.",13
169,"This means that colonial discourse analysis is not merely a marginal adjunct to more mainstream studies, a specialized activity only for minorities or for historians of imperialism and colonialism, but itself forms the point of questioning of Western knowledge's categories and assumptions.",13
170,"In the same way, Fanon suggests that at the political level the so-called ‘Third World’ constitutes the disruptive term for the European political dialectic of capitalism and socialism.",13
171,"Everyone feels the need nowadays to qualify the term ‘Third World’, stating quite correctly that it should not be taken to imply a homogeneous entity.",13
172,"The inadequateness of the term, however, it offers a univocal description of an extremely heterogeneous section of the world, also means that a suitable alternative general category cannot by definition be produced.",13
173,"In this situation, abject apologies in some respects remain complicit with the patronizing attitudes from which they attempt to disassociate themselves.",13
174,"For the ‘Third World’ was invented in the context of the 1955 Bandung Conference, on the model of the French Revolution's ‘Third Estate’, and incorporating equally revolutionary ideals of providing a radical alternative to the hegemonic capitalist-socialist power  blocks of the post-war period.",13
175,The Third World as a term needs to retrieve this lost positive sense — today the political order has changed to some extent the various forms of Islamic fundamentalism have taken over the role of providing a direct alternative to First and Second World ideologies.,13
176,"‘Third World’ will, therefore, be used in this book without (further) apology, or scare quotes, as a positive term of radical critique it also necessarily signals its negative sense of economic dependency and exploitation.",13
177,III THE PHILOSOPHICAL ALLERGY,13
178,"Although Said rejects them, and Foucault characteristically does not mention them, the most effective ploys that have recently been played in this project of articulating another form of knowledge, of redefining the basis of knowledge as such, derive from a different although related body of work to that which Foucault describes — namely the phenomenological tradition of Heidegger, Levinas, and Derrida, which, seemingly like all twentieth-century European philosophy, also traces its apparent origins back to Husserl.",13
179,"As we have seen, the fundamental problem concerns the way in which knowledge — and therefore theory, or history — is constituted through the comprehension and incorporation of the other.",13
180,"This has led to a series of attempts to reinscribe a place for, and a relation with, the other as other, outside the sphere of mastery and therefore, logically speaking, both infinite and beyond the scope of knowledge.",13
181,"Emmanuel Levinas, , whose career has been long enough to have introduced Husserl to Sartre in the thirties and to have been able to reply to Derrida in the seventies, proposes a rather different critique of such models of knowledge to those which we have encountered so far.",13
182,"Levinas,",13
183,"Western philosophy coincides with the disclosure of the other where the other, in manifesting itself as a being, loses its alterity.",13
184,From its infancy philosophy has been struck with a horror of the other that remains other — with an insurmountable allergy…,13
185,Hegel's philosophy represents the logical outcome of this underlying allergy of philosophy.,13
186,Levinas objects to the implicit violence in the process of knowledge which appropriates and sublates the essence of the other into itself.,13
187,"But as we can see, he does not just blame Hegel here, for Levinas ontology itself is the problem.",13
188,"Concerned to find a way to allow the other to remain as other, Levinas therefore rejects not only Hegel but Husserl, Heidegger and Sartre also, and abjures ontology altogether.",13
189,"Because ontology involves an ethico-political violence towards the other, always to some degree seen as a threat, Levinas proposes ethics in its place, substituting a respect for the other for a grasping of it, and a theory of desire not as negation and assimilation but as infinite separation.",13
190,"In (1961), a book self-consciously written under the shadow of two ‘world’ wars in which Europe, at the limit of its attempt to devour the world, turned in on itself in two violent acts of self-consummation, Levinas questions the accepted relation between morality and politics.",13
191,"It must always, he suggests, be possible to criticize politics from the point of view of the ethical.",13
192,"As Althusser was keen to emphasize, Marx morality works simply as a form of ideological control, and Levinas concurs that ‘everyone will readily agree that it is the highest importance to know whether we are not duped by morality’(21).",13
193,"But, he argues, the placing of politics —‘the art of foreseeing war and of winning it by every means’— before morality overlooks the extent to which war constitutes the philosophical concept of being itself.",13
194,"For being is always defined as the appropriation of either difference into identity, or of identities into a greater order, be it absolute knowledge, History, or the state.",13
195,"For its part, violence involves not just physical force, injuring or annihilating persons, but also",13
196,"interrupting their continuity, making them play roles in which they recognize themselves, making them betray not only commitments but their own substance…",13
197,Not only modern war but every war employs arms that turn against those who wield them.,13
198,It establishes an order from which can keep his distance; nothing henceforth is exterior.,13
199,(21),13
200,"War, then, is another form of the appropriation of the other, and underpins all ontological thinking with its violence.",13
201,"Its corollary, or ‘visage’, is the concept of totality, which, as Levinas observes, has dominated Western philosophy in its long history of desire for Unity and the One.",13
202,"Through the totality, itself a kind of rational self writ large, the individual takes on meaning; the present is sacrificed to a future which will bring forth an ultimate, objective meaning when the totality of history is realized.",13
203,"The objection therefore to totalization is not founded on any simple analogy with totalitarianism — though neither can this be excluded — but rather on the implicit violence of ontology itself, in which the same constitutes itself through a form of negativity the other, producing all knowledge by appropriating and sublating the other within itself.",13
204,"As Levinas puts it, ‘the idea of truth as a grasp on things must necessarily have a non-metaphorical sense somewhere’.",13
205,"In Western philosophy, when knowledge or theory comprehends the other, then the alterity of the latter vanishes as it becomes part of the same.",13
206,"This ‘ontological imperialism’, Levinas argues, goes back to Socrates but can be found as recently as Heidegger.",13
207,"In all cases the other is neutralized as a means of encompassing it: ontology amounts to a philosophy of power, an egotism in which the relation with the other is accomplished through its assimilation into the self.",13
208,Its political implications are clear enough:,13
209,"Heidegger, with the whole of Western history, takes the relation with the Other as enacted in the destiny of sedentary peoples, the possessors and builders of the earth.",13
210,"Possession is preeminently the form in which the other becomes the same, by becoming mine.",13
211,(46),13
212,"Ontology, therefore, though outwardly directed, remains always centred in an incorporating self: ‘this imperialism of the same’, Levinas suggests, ‘is the whole essence of freedom’(87).",13
213,For freedom is maintained by a self-possession which extends itself to anything that threatens its identity.,13
214,"In this structure European philosophy reduplicates Western foreign policy, where democracy at home is maintained through colonial or neocolonial oppression abroad.",13
215,"Levinas opposes freedom, based on self-interest, to justice, which respects the alterity of the other and can only be proposed through the asymmetry of dialogue.",13
216,This also implies an interrogation of the imperialism of theory itself.,13
217,"For theory, as a form of knowledge and understanding of the spectator, is constitutively unable to let the other remain outside itself, outside its representation of the panorama which it surveys, in a state of singularity or separation.",13
218,"This will also be true of any concept, because by definition the concept ‘cannot capture the absolutely-other’; and, to the extent that it must invoke a form of generality, of language itself.",13
219,"Any conventional form of understanding must appropriate the other, in an act of violence and reduction.",13
220,"This leads Levinas to denounce the inability of theory, in its drive to comprehension and representation, to do justice to any radical exteriority.",13
221,But how can we know respect the other?,13
222,Is there a means of bridging the gap between knowledge and morality that avoids the problems of Kant's recourse to the aesthetic but also resists Lyotard's argument that the two are simply incommensurable?,13
223,How can Levinas' ethics work differently from ontology?,13
224,"Against the egotism of the preoccupation of being with itself, he posits a relation of sociality, whereby the self assimilating the other opens itself to it through a relation with it.",13
225,"In the place of the correlation of knowledge with vision and light, the visual metaphor by which the adequation of the idea with the thing has been thought from Plato to Heidegger, Levinas proposes language, which in the form of speech enables a kind of invisible contact between subjects that leaves them both intact.",13
226,"Language, however, should take the form of dialogue: whereas the universality of reason means that it must necessarily renounce all singularity, and whereas language's function in conceptualizing thought is to suppress the other and bring it within the aegis of the same, in dialogue language maintains the distance between the two; ‘their commerce’, as Levinas puts it, ‘is ethical’.",13
227,"Dialogism allows for ‘radical separation, the strangeness of the interlocutors, the revelation of the other to me’(73).",13
228,"The structure of dialogue, moreover, disallows the taking up of any position beyond the  interlocutors from which they can be integrated into a larger totality.",13
229,"The relation between them, therefore, is not oppositional, nor limitrophe, but one of alterity.",13
230,"Dialogue, face to face conversation, maintains a non-symmetrical relation, a separation through speech.",13
231,"In so doing it breaches any totality, including History:",13
232,"To say that the other can remain absolutely other, that he enters only into the relationship of conversation, is to say that history itself, an identification of the same, cannot claim to totalise the same and the other.",13
233,"The absolutely other, whose alterity is overcome in the philosophy of immanence on the allegedly common plane of history, maintains his transcendence in the midst of history.",13
234,"The same is essentially identification within the diverse, or history, or system.",13
235,"It is not I who resist the system, as Kierkegaard thought; it is the other.",13
236,(40),13
237,"The thesis of the primacy of History, Levinas argues, forms part of the imperialism of the same.",13
238,"For ‘totalization is accomplished only in history, when the historiographer assimilates all particular existences and punctual moments into the time of universal history, whose chronological order, it is assumed, ‘outlines the plot of being in itself, analogous to nature’(55).",13
239,"If History claims to incorporate the other within a larger impersonal spirit or idea, albeit the ruse of reason, Levinas contends that ‘this alleged integration is cruelty and injustice, ,[it]ignores the Other’(52).",13
240,History is the realm of violence and war; it constitutes another form by which the other is appropriated into the same.,13
241,For the other to remain other it must not derive its meaning from History but must instead have a separate time which differs from historical time.,13
242,"Whereas for Heidegger time and history are the horizon of Being, for Levinas ‘when man truly approaches the Other he is uprooted from history’(52).",13
243,"Time itself involves the ‘relationship to unattainable alterity’, an absolute past.",13
244,"It is in temporality, in anteriority, that we find an otherness beyond being.",13
245,Levinas calls the relation in which an infinite distance is maintained from the other ‘metaphysics’.,13
246,"Metaphysics, he writes, ‘transcendence, the welcoming of the other by the same, of the Other by me, is concretely produced as the calling into question of the same by the other, , as the ethics that accomplishes the critical essence of knowledge’(43).",13
247,Metaphysics therefore precedes ontology.,13
248,"Though a troubling term, metaphysics for Levinas names a counter-tradition in philosophy in which the idea of infinity breaches all totality because ‘it is a relationship ’(22).",13
249,"This surplus is the effect of the radical alterity of the other, whether as ‘face’ or as death, which prevents the totality from being constituted as such.",13
250,"As might be expected, it is the possibility of this absolute otherness, and the ability to excise all violence in the relation with it, which Derrida questions in the first of his discussions of Levinas.",13
251,"Whereas Levinas, like Habermas, posits an authentic language of expression which abhors the distortions of ‘rhetoric’, Derrida argues that such alterity is constituted not through dialogue but rather through the operation of language itself: Levinas' transcendence-as-surplus is therefore redefined as a Derridean supplement.",13
252,"This would mean that there can never be an authentic speech of the other as such, a position which certainly troubles Levinas' fundamental argument.",13
253,"Despite their differences, Derrida's keen interest in Levinas, as Christopher Norris has argued in scrupulously non-Derridean terms, points to ‘the ultimately ethical nature of his enterprise’.",13
254,"The early essay on Levinas, dating from 1964, shows the extent to which Derrida has been implicated in such questions from the first — though,Norris, he has always shown that the conditions of ‘writing’ that make ethics possible also makes them impossible.",13
255,Certain orientations of his work can be affiliated to Levinas' attempt to shift the relation to alterity from an appropriation by the same into its totality to a respect for the other's heterogeneity.,13
256,Derrida has even described the critique of logocentrism as ‘above all else the search for the ‘other’’.,13
257,This can be related to the concern in Derrida's work with the politics of feminism and other positions which contest institutional and political appropriation and exclusion.,13
258,In recent years Levinas has himself articulated more explicitly his account of the relation of the ethical to the political.,13
259,"If there were just two, as in the face-to-face dialogue, then the ethical would preside as the injunction of responsibility for the other.",13
260,"But there are three, he suggests, then the ethical moves into politics.",13
261,"‘We can never’, Levinas concedes to Derrida, ‘completely escape from the language of ontology and politics’.",13
262,"But this does not mean that the ethical has to renounce the moral order in the political world of the third person — of justice, of government, institutions, or the law.",13
263,"The political can retain an ethical foundation: Levinas finds his example for this, unexpectedly, in Marx's famous comment on idealist philosophers — that the point is not to describe the world but to change it:",13
264,In Marx's critique we find an ethical conscience cutting through the ontological identification of truth with an ideal intelligibility and demanding that theory be converted into a concrete praxis of concern for the other.,13
265,From this perspective Levinas proposes the possibility that the much lamented ‘subject’ be brought back not as the ontological subject which seeks to reduce everything to itself but as an ethical subject defined the other: ‘Ethics redefines subjectivity as this heteronomous responsibility in contrast to autonomous freedom’.,13
266,"We might compare this ethical relation to Cixous' remarks about the need to love the other or Kristeva's recent preoccupation with love which, from this perspective, hardly involves the sudden apostasy of which she has been  accused, but rather Levinas consists of a way of formulating a ‘responsibility for the Other, being-for-the-other’.",13
267,In each case these writers can be shown to be trying to place the other outside the sphere of mastery in a relation of negation or of reduplication of the self.,13
268,"Unlike a conventional ethics of altruism, such a relation remains one of alterity.",13
269,"There will always be some return for the self in any gift — unless it can be articulated in an economy of ingratitude, a movement without return.",13
270,"Unless, , philosophy can become dissemination: ‘’.",13
271,"To the story of Ulysses, Levinas opposes that of Abraham who leaves his fatherland , never to return.",13
272,"This figure of the diaspora returns us to one of the most important aspects of Levinas' formulation of the relation of the ethical to the political, that is the connections which he makes between the structure of ontology and Eurocentrism, the latter ‘disqualified’, as he puts it, ‘by so many horrors’.",13
273,"He connects the form of knowledge that is self-centred but directed outwards, philosophy as ‘egology’, quite explicitly with the appropriating narcissism of the West.",13
274,"So in the past few hundred years Europe has been, as Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak has suggested, constituted and consolidated as ‘sovereign subject, indeed sovereign and subject’.",13
275,"Just as the colonized has been constructed the terms of the colonizer's own self-image, as the ‘self-consolidating other’, so Europe",13
276,"consolidated itself as sovereign subject by defining its colonies as ‘Others’, even as it constituted them, for purposes of administration and the expansion of markets, into programmed near-images of that very sovereign self.",13
277,"It is this sovereign self of Europe which is today being deconstructed, showing the extent to which Europe's other has been a narcissistic self-image through which it has constituted itself while never allowing it to achieve a perfect fit.",13
278,This can be allied to Derrida's critique of ‘a certain fundamental Europeanization of world culture’.,13
279,Derrida has sometimes been criticized for the generality of phrases ‘the history of the West’ or the claim that his work involves a critique of ‘Western metaphysics’.,13
280,"Although one of the earliest questions put to him in England concerned this category of ‘the West’, in the subsequent fervour that accompanied the transformation of Derrida's work into the method of deconstruction, this problem tended to slip view.",13
281,"In its largest and perhaps most significant perspective, deconstruction involves not just a critique of the grounds of knowledge , but specifically of the grounds of Occidental knowledge.",13
282,"The equation of knowledge with ‘what is called Western thought, the thought whose destiny is to extend its domains while the boundaries of the West are drawn back’ involves the very kind of assumption that Derrida is interrogating — and this is the reason for his  constant emphasis on its being the knowledge of the West; in the same way Foucault also emphasizes that he is specifically discussing the ‘Western ’.",13
283,"The assertion that Derrida's work incurs a form of relativism is thus exactly to the point, though its implications are rather different from those generally assumed in such a complaint.",13
284,"For we can say that deconstruction involves the decentralization and decolonization of European thought — it is ‘incapable of respecting the Being and meaning of the other’, and to the extent that its philosophical tradition makes ‘common cause with oppression and with the totalitarianism of the same’.",13
285,This has been the significance of Levinas' thought for Derrida.,13
286,"As he puts it in , at the very moment when the fundamental conceptual systems of Europe are in the process of taking over all of humanity, Levinas leads us instead to ‘an inconceivable process of dismantling and dispossession’.",13
287,For Levinas' thought,13
288,"seeks to liberate itself from the Greek domination of the Same and the One…as if from oppression itself — an oppression certainly comparable to in the world, an ontological or transcendental oppression, but also the origin or alibi of all oppression in the world.",13
289,This is the context in which to set Derrida's own intervention in .,13
290,"Everyone knows that that book is a critique of ‘logocentrism’; what is less often recalled is that the terms of the critique with which it opens announce the design of focusing attention on logocentrism's ’ which, Derrida suggests, is ‘nothing but the most original and powerful ethnocentrism, in the process of imposing itself upon the world’.",13
291,"It is this preoccupation which accounts for Derrida's choice, and forceful interrogation, of the privileged examples of Saussure — where he focuses on the ‘profound ethnocentrism’ of his exclusion of writing — Rousseau and Lévi-Strauss.",13
292,"In the case of the latter, Derrida's interest also focuses particularly on the way in which Lévi-Strauss produces his knowledge of a non-European civilization a doubled but non-contradictory logic which evades identity-thinking.",13
293,"The well-known deconstruction carried out in ‘Structure, Sign, and Play’ shows how the constitution of anthropological knowledge, though often paraded as scientific and objective, is nevertheless governed by a problematic of which it remains unaware: the philosophical category of the centre — which Derrida then proceeds to articulate with the problem of Eurocentrism.",13
294,"The analysis of the dialectics of the centre and the margin can thus operate geographically conceptually, articulating the power relationships between the metropolitan and the colonial cultures at their geographical peripheries.",13
295,"This is not to suggest, however, that deconstruction in any sense brings another knowledge to bear: rather it involves a critique of Western knowledge that works by exploiting the ambivalent resources of Western writing, Marxism were to produce a critique of ideology without the advantage of its  science (which, given the current ambiguous status of Marxist science is not a possibility to be dismissed lightly).",13
296,"If one had to answer, therefore, the general question of what is deconstruction a deconstruction of, the answer would be, of the concept, the authority, and assumed primacy of, the category of ‘the West’.",13
297,"If deconstruction forms part of a more widespread attempt to decolonize the forms of European thought, from this perspective Derrida's work can be understood as characteristically postmodern.",13
298,postmodernism can best be defined as European culture's awareness that it is the unquestioned and dominant centre of the world.,13
299,"Significantly enough one of the very earliest uses of the term ‘postmodern’, dating from the time of the Second World War, was that of Arnold Toynbee in his .",13
300,"He used it to describe the new age of Western history which, Toynbee, began in the 1870s with the simultaneous globalization of Western culture and the re-empowerment of non-Western states.",13
301,"If this new period brought with it a phase of Spenglerian pessimism after the long years of Victorian optimism, Toynbee did not himself assume that the West was in decline as such, but rather that paradoxically the globalization of Western civilization was being accompanied by a self-consciousness of its own cultural relativization, a process to which Toynbee's own equally totalizing and relativizing history was designed to contribute.",13
302,"Reviewing the genesis of his whole project, he recounts that his history was written",13
303,"against a current Late Modern Western convention of identifying a  and provincial Western Society's history with ‘History’, writ large,.",13
304,In the writer's view this convention was the preposterous off-spring of a distorting egocentric illusion to which the children of a Western Civilisation had succumbed like the children of all other known civilisations and known primitive societies.,13
305,"Postmodernism, therefore, becomes a certain self-consciousness about a culture's own historical relativity — which begins to explain why, as its critics complain, it also involves the loss of the sense of an absoluteness of any Western account of History.",13
306,"Today, if we pose the difficult question of the relation of poststructuralism to postmodernism, one distinction between them that might be drawn would be that whereas postmodernism seems to include the problematic of the place of Western culture non-Western cultures, poststructuralism as a category seems not to imply such a perspective.",13
307,"This, however, is hardly the case, for it rather involves if anything a more active critique of the Eurocentric premises of Western knowledge.",13
308,"The difference would be that it does not offer a by positioning itself outside ‘the West’, but rather uses its own alterity and duplicity to effect its deconstruction.",13
309,"In this context, we may note, attempts to account for poststructuralism the aftermath of the events of May 68 seem positively myopic, lacking the very historical  perspective to which they lay claim.",13
310,"Contrary, then, to some of its more overreaching definitions, postmodernism itself could be said to mark not just the cultural effects of a new stage of ‘late’ capitalism, but the sense of the loss of European history and culture as History and Culture, the loss of their unquestioned place at the centre of the world.",13
311,"We could say that if, Foucault, the centrality of ‘Man’ dissolved at the end of the eighteenth century as the ‘Classical Order’gave way to ‘History’, today at the end of the twentieth century, as ‘History’gives way to the ‘Postmodern’, we are witnessing the dissolution of ‘the West’.",13
312,Marxism and the question of history,13
313,Marxist literary criticism has not produced a new theory in over twenty years.,13
314,Not since Macherey's of 1966 has there been any fundamental theoretical innovation.,13
315,This date and this gap are fortuitous.,13
316,"For much of this century Marxist literary criticism monopolized the realm of literary theory, for the simple reason that only Marxists consistently believed in its value and strategic necessity.",13
317,2 But since the rise of structuralism in the sixties Marxist criticism has been more and more on the defensive.,13
318,Marxist humanists still often consider structuralism simply as an attack on Marxism; this theory would be more persuasive if so many structuralists had not also been Marxists.,13
319,"By contrast, it is certainly the case that, with certain notable exceptions, there are few Marxist poststructuralists.",13
320,"If by the late seventies the intellectual arguments of poststructuralism began to seem virtually unanswerable, resistance eventually crystallized around the question of history.",13
321,"In its preoccupation with textuality, poststructuralism had apparently forgotten all about it.",13
322,"The earliest such critique in the field of literary theory was that of Frank Lentricchia, who organized his entire account of modern criticism around the premise of a ‘repeated and extremely subtle denial of history by a variety of contemporary theorists’.",13
323,"Lentricchia's argument was quickly endorsed by Terry Eagleton who claimed first that poststructuralism represented a ‘hedonist withdrawal from history’(aestheticism) and, a year later, that it amounted to a more menacing holocaust-like ‘liquidation of history’.",13
324,"Moving beyond the confines of the literary, perry Anderson has similarly dismissed all poststructuralism on the grounds that it represents ‘’.",13
325,"But what, we might pause to ask, is this remark supposed to suggest?",13
326,"Is Anderson using the word ‘random’ in its mathematical sense, as one a series, or in its statistical sense in which each item has an individual chance?",13
327,It seems not.,13
328,"More likely he is using it in the more everyday usage of ‘not sent or guided in any special direction; having no definite aim or purpose’(OED), which suggests that any such view of history must have no end, and therefore no teleology.",13
329,"In other words, what  we are really dealing with here is a defence of a belief in the rationality of the historical process.",13
330,"Anderson's history must work a rational principle, the dialectic, and be moving towards an end which will reveal and enact its meaning.",13
331,"Without such a purpose, it is assumed, history must be meaningless.",13
332,"The terms of this argument repeat exactly those of the critical debate about univocal meaning, which the only alternative to the idea that history has a single meaning must be that it has none .",13
333,"But has really been suggesting that history has no meaning, for the obvious reason that any interpretation of history as such must assert meaning.",13
334,What is in dispute is whether history has a meaning as ‘History’.,13
335,"One alternative would be that history may be made up of the multiple meanings of specific, particular histories — without their necessarily being in turn part of a larger meaning of an underlying Idea or force.",13
336,"Anderson's accusation, which conflates the concept of the differential with the notion of the random, is therefore really directed against the possibility that different histories may have different meanings.",13
337,But why deny that history can have multiple meanings?,13
338,", it already has — for even for a Marxist who believes in the possibility of ‘science’ there exists the multiplicity of meanings of truth and of error.",13
339,We are therefore not so much talking about a single meaning as a true one versus all the others which are false.,13
340,"In a similar way, even ‘History’ as a metahistorical category achieves its single meaning by subsuming a range of ethico-political concepts, ‘progress’, ‘human freedom’, ‘necessity’and the like, which then form the basis of the regulation and authorization of historical interpretation.",13
341,This shifts the discussion any simple antithesis.,13
342,"The question about history then becomes the more interesting one of the relation between different significations, and the ways in which such differences can, or cannot, be articulated and unified under the same horizon of totalization to produce a single meaning.",13
343,"Until the lonely hour arrives in which the philosophical proof of the truth of history is produced, then history will inevitably continue as a representation and interpretation of the past — Marxist truth and the false or limited interpretation of all other historians.",13
344,"As a form of understanding history will necessarily also be the whole range of questions that surround interpretation, representation and narrative in any form.",13
345,"This is the reason why in recent years theorists have turned their attention back to the question of the historicity of historical understanding, to its status as interpretation, representation or narrative, and, more radically, to the problem of temporality as such.",13
346,"Lentricchia and Eagleton, by contrast, invoke history rather like ‘the political’: an outside, a concrete, that somehow remains exterior to ‘theory’, unaffected by it, capable of enclosing it and even swallowing it up — history were in a position to consume theory.",13
347,History here is self-evident and needs no elaboration.,13
348,We all know what it is (apparently).,13
349,But the  problem with the idea that it is possible to dismiss structuralism and poststructuralism with the charge that they neglect history is that this argument itself neglects history.,13
350,"For history, as Althusser noted, has always been a problematical concept.",13
351,"Any examination of the history of ‘history, will demonstrate that it has never had the immediate certainty that is implied in the all too frequent invocation of, concrete history’.",13
352,"Far from being the concrete, it has always rather been the theoretical problem.",13
353,To acknowledge that amounts to something very different from simply excising history as such.,13
354,Nevertheless the suggestion that structuralism and poststructuralism have denied history is a persuasive one which now has wide currency.,13
355,"Such an argument, in implying that the problem is simply a question of the lack of history or of its presence, history were some undifferentiated entity that could just be added or taken away, stepped into or got , skates over the fact that the real question has always focused on the much more difficult issue of what of history, and of what status can be accorded to historical thought.",13
356,The reproach that poststructuralism has neglected history really consists of the complaint that it has questioned History.,13
357,"This becomes clearer if it is considered from the more general perspective of post-modernism which has been widely characterized as involving a return of history, albeit as a category of representation.",13
358,"In fact it was rather modernism, as its name implies (from latin , just now, or , today), that tried to awake from the nightmare of history, self-consciously setting itself against the past, and rejecting forms of historical understanding.",13
359,"The argument against poststructuralism really just repeats Lukács' reproach, set out in his 1957 essay ‘The Ideology of Modernism’, that modernism involves a ‘negation of history’.",13
360,"If Lukács' objections to modernism laid the basis for all contemporary objections to poststructuralism, his continuing influence can help us to understand why history is privileged here.",13
361,II ‘IN HISTORY’,13
362,"For why, after all, ‘history’ ?",13
363,"Why, from the point of view of Marxism proper, not the class-struggle, or economics, the state, or social relations?",13
364,"The stress on history as paramount provides a straightforward indication where such arguments are coming from: not Marxism as a political practice, but the Hegelian Marxism of the philosophical tradition initiated by Lukács' (1923).",13
365,"Criticizing the orthodox Marxism which regarded dialectics as an external law validated by natural science, Lukács argued for the primacy of history over economics as the most significant element in the methodology of Marxism.",13
366,His stress on Marxism as a historical method that presupposed and required the idea of totality initiated a course that determined the history of Western Marxism to our own day.,13
367,"That history, from one perspective, could be seen as a  consistent struggle to retain Lukács' legacy in which history, the dialectic and the totality are interdependent to the extent that each is essential to the operation of the other in the production of a Marxist science.",13
368,"Poststructuralism, which in its own way also takes part in that history of Western Marxism, differs only it foregrounds the implications of the theoretical difficulties involved repressing them the unrealized ideal.",13
369,For Lukács' legacy could also be seen to have bequeathed a curse.,13
370,"The insistence on history as a totality, necessary if historical materialism is to justify itself as true, left Marxism with a fragile category that from the very first was always on the point of breaking apart.",13
371,"To characterize only recent French thought as ‘the logic of disintegration’, as Peter Dews has recently done, masks over the fact that such a logic is fundamental to Marxism itself, the unassimilable dark other to its ‘primacy of the category of totality’.",13
372,"Yet if Lukács laid this theoretical burden upon Western Marxism, he had, ironically, already written the narrative of its subsequent history in his earlier, pre-Marxist,(1920).",13
373,In that work it is possible to see clearly the relation between his insistence on totality and the Romantic aesthetic of totality as the inner necessity that moulds all works of art.,13
374,"More significantly, totality is defined its absence for modern man who exists in a relation of alienation from the world.",13
375,"The novel, Lukács, consists of a striving for unity, a lost state of being represented for him many German Romantics by an idealized picture of classical Greece, punctuated by the continual intrusion of a heterogeneous discontinuity.",13
376,"Lukács argues that the novel can transcend this threat of dispersal through an assertion of a continuous temporality, but at the same time he formulates the process in the structure of a fall: ‘Once this unity disintegrated, there could be no more spontaneous totality of being’.",13
377,"This account, whose origins in German Romanticism are obviously comparable to Marx's, points to the subsequent difficulty for Marxism itself: the lost ‘spontaneous’ totality of being can never be retrieved.",13
378,The objections to poststructuralism at one level therefore represent merely the latest version of the Romantic nostalgia for this unfallen totality of being.,13
379,"The history of Western Marxism amounts to a history of attempts to provide a means for transcending the condition of alienation and achieving that lost totality, not through irony or a reified homogeneous temporality, as in Lukács' novel, but, his formulation of Marxism, through history and class consciousness.",13
380,"The problem, however, is that that reconstituted totality is never certain, its status always remains ambivalent.",13
381,The appearance of at the height of the Modernist movement suggests the degree to which history was being totalized by Lukács at the very moment when the process of detotalization had already begun — even in the aporetic possibilities of his own writings.,13
382,"So in (1937) Lukács himself would reject as delusion what he calls ‘a specially strong temptation to try and produce an extensively complete totality’, advocating instead a dramatic concentration and intensification of, outwardly insignificant events'.",13
383,"Their relation to the totality emerges not through the form of synecdoche — the typical detail which can then be generalized as metaphor — but should, Lukács, be drawn out through the narrative which inscribes and extends a connection between such moments of empirical reality and the general laws of history as a totality.",13
384,Lukács' historicism depends upon the resolution of this tension between the idea of history and the singular detail.,13
385,"But the fundamental incommensurability of idea and event re-emerges in a precariousness in this narrativization of history where each disturbance in the writing punctuates it with the unassimilable, discontinuous and disjunctive temporality of the event.",13
386,"Lukács' early assault on Marxist economism, subsequently retracted under criticism from the Leninist orthodoxy of the Comintern, became particularly influential in the post-war period among Marxist intellectuals who sought to redefine a new Marxist humanism against the economism of Stalinism with which Lukács' name had by that time itself become associated.",13
387,"Most prominent among those was Sartre, who, in the spirit of Lukács, declared that ‘both sociology and economism must be dissolved in ’.",13
388,"Today when the primacy of history above all else — the economic, even class conflict — is asserted within a Marxist discourse, together with an accompanying defence of humanism, it can usually be traced back to a Marxism of a Sartrean existentialist form.",13
389,"It comes as no surprise, , to discover that the argument about poststructuralism neglecting history was initiated by those whose own intellectual formation can be identified with the existential Marxist humanism of the New Left of the 1950s and early 1960s.",13
390,But the case of Sartre poignantly demonstrates that the return-to-history argument can really only succeed through a form of historical amnesia which conveniently forgets that history was almost impossible to find.,13
391,"Any historical investigation will show that history has always been a problematic concept for Marxism, not something that has the status of a ‘concrete’ existence outside and beyond theory.",13
392,This could be demonstrated for Lukács or indeed for Marx himself.,13
393,"But in the context of the alleged neglect of history by poststructuralism, it will be more appropriate to confine our discussion to the Marxism of the post-war period.",13
394,Here too history has always been the problem not the solution — which is why both structuralism and poststructuralism can be positioned within the broad trajectory of a post-war Marxism that has taken the form of a sustained enquiry into concepts of history and even the very possibility of its conceptualization.,13
395,III THE CRISIS OF STALINISM,13
396,"Sartre's existential Marxism, as Ronald Aronson has recently emphasized, was itself formulated criticisms of the function of history in his work by the untimely post-war ‘post-Marxist’, Maurice Merleau-ponty.",13
397,"In (1955), Merleau-Ponty accused the Sartre of (1952) of using an existentialist ontology to justify communism ‘as a completely voluntary effort to go beyond, to destroy and to recreate history’:",13
398,"Sartre founds communist action precisely by refusing any productivity to history and by making history, it is intelligible, the immediate result of our volitions.",13
399,"the rest, it is an impenetrable opacity.",13
400,"Through his ‘extreme subjectivism’, Merleau-ponty argued, Sartre avoided the traditional claims of Marxism to be the realization of history — and thus also the problem of the relation of Marxism to Stalinism.",13
401,"With the growing recognition of the real nature of the Stalinist regime, the ideological divisions of pre-war Europe became too simplistic to sustain, and even the (wait-and-see) attitude taken after the war by many Marxists, including Merleau-Ponty himself in (1947), became tenable.",13
402,"Stalinism posed a crisis for Marxism from which it could, in a sense, be said never to have recovered, the conundrum being that if Marxism is true, as it claims that it is, how did the first Marxist state end up as Stalinist?",13
403,"There are basically two positions that can be taken this irrevocable split between theory and practice: either Marxism has been shown to be not true, or the Marxism of Stalinist Russia was not proper Marxism.",13
404,"The second alternative poses a serious problem, however, it leads to the further question, how could such Marxism not be true — in the sense of how could History, in the objective processes on which a scientific Marxism places so much faith, be undialectical enough to produce Stalinism from the October Revolution?",13
405,How could History have failed to bring about an end to history?,13
406,Merleau-Ponty's response was to argue that history itself had shown Marxist philosophy to have been flawed; such philosophy must therefore give up its claim to truth.,13
407,"Ironically, then, the trajectory which today produces the Marxist argument that poststructuralism neglects history was itself initiated by the claim that Marxism itself had been invalidated by history.",13
408,"In this context, the major challenge for Marxism became how to explain Marxism's ‘detour’ from itself, a question on which Sartre's project was to founder in the second volume of the .",13
409,"It was Stalin's unfortunate deviation which led to the whole series of attempts by Western European Marxists to return-to-Marx — the major examples in France being Sartre and Althusser, and in Germany the Frankfurt School.",13
410,"Merleau-Ponty, on the other hand, arguing that only one Marxism, Stalinism, could be said to be the product of actual history, rejected any possibility of trying to define a new, more genuine Marxism as the return-to-Marxists tried to do.",13
411,"Merleau-Ponty, Western academic Marxism, starting with Lukács, amounted only to the production of ‘ideas without historical equivalents’(204).",13
412,"He therefore repudiated any attempt to begin the painful separation of an ‘authentic’ from a ‘false’, orthodox or official Marxism, choosing rather to stress the ambivalence of Marxism itself.",13
413,"For Merleau-Ponty no sublation could resolve Marxism s own division between its theory and the history of its practice, itself, he argued, an acting its theoretical equivocation between history as a process of natural necessity and history as the product of human praxis.",13
414,"These conflicts, he contended, although highlighted in the differences between the Western Marxism of Lukács and the orthodoxy of Marxist-Leninism, could be traced back to the work of Marx himself.",13
415,"Merleau-Ponty's argument thus meant acknowledging a certain equivocalness in Marxist claims to truth, which could claim exemption from critical examination, and led inevitably, therefore, to an early form of what, even then, was characterized as ‘post-Marxism’.",13
416,"Merleau-ponty, whose anticipations of later post-Marxists Foucault and Lyotard are readily apparent, therefore rejected not the dialectic as such, nor history, but the closed dialectic as an autonomous principle that was supposed to produce the grand narrative of History:",13
417,"The illusion was only to precipitate into a historical fact — the proletariat's birth and growth — history's total meaning, to believe that history itself organized its own recovery, that the proletariat's power would be its own suppression, the negation of the negation.",13
418,(205),13
419,"In a provocative comparison of the failures of the French and Russian revolutions, he argued that the problem stemmed from the fact that no class, whether proletarian or bourgeoisie, can become the ruling class without taking upon itself something of the historical role of a ruling class — especially if at the same time it also considers that, history carries within itself its own cure':",13
420,"To assume that the proletariat will be able to defend its dictatorship against entanglement is to assume in history itself a substantial and given principle which would drive ambiguity from it, sum it up, totalise it, and close it.",13
421,(221),13
422,"Instead, Merleau-Ponty proposed an open dialectic which would concede Marxism's equivocalness, and give up the claim to the dialectical logic of History as a process of objective truth.",13
423,"Or to put it another way, he maintained that Marxism can only constitute its totality through its perpetual detours from itself.",13
424,Sartre's extravagances,13
425,"Thus, the world and man reveal themselves by .",13
426,"And all the undertakings we might speak of reduce themselves to a single one, that of .",13
427,Jean-Paul Sartre,13
428,Sartre took the opposite course to Merleau-Ponty and sought instead to define a new authentic Marxism.,13
429,"His project in the (1960) amounted to a philosophical defence of Marxism and its dialectic through a reassertion of its claim to be the only valid interpretation of history, ‘the untranscendable philosophy for our time’.",13
430,"However, Sartre was no more prepared than Merleau-ponty to return to what he characterized as Marxist organicism, in which the laws of history unfold their own autonomous momentum.",13
431,"Not wishing to propose History as a transcendent law outside the human, Sartre was careful to distinguish his claims from Engels' validation of the dialectic as the law of nature.",13
432,"He sought instead to prove that history achieves its course and its meaning from the actions of men, men are also simultaneously the products of history.",13
433,Merleau-ponty had accused the existentialist Sartre of denying history and trying to hold everything together instead ‘only by the hopeless heroism of the I’.,13
434,"Sartre therefore tried to show that the two were not opposed: arguing that the dialectic is produced by human subjectivity inscribed within history itself, at the same time he also asserted the truth of the Marxist account of there being one history with a single meaning — a history, , in which all differences return as the same.",13
435,"Everything, therefore, hinged on Sartre's ability to substantiate the inter-dependence of these two claims.",13
436,"‘There is a crisis in Marxism’, Sartre announced at the beginning of the ; this crisis, not the first and not to be the last, Sartre characterized as the result of a paradox in which historical materialism had become ‘at one and the same time, the only truth of History and a total of the Truth’(I, 19).",13
437,Today we might say that it had been shown to be different from itself.,13
438,"This was the aporia detected by Merleau-Ponty: but question Marxism's truth, Sartre sought to remove its indetermination.",13
439,"He  argued that though historical materialism had satisfactorily explained the forms and conditions of human reality it had never established theoretically the validity of its own existence, never shown how it constituted not just the substance of reality but its logical form .",13
440,"to prove the truth of History's prospective totalization into one meaning, therefore, Sartre's initial philosophical task was to ground his argument epistemologically by proving the legitimacy of the dialectic itself, thus demonstrating not only that history was dialectically intelligible but also why it necessarily should be so.",13
441,"‘The dialectic’, Sartre, ‘is both a method a movement in the object’(I, 20): Marxism asserts simultaneously that both the process of knowledge and the structure of the real are dialectical, but it has never proved the former — basing its claim to truth instead on the ‘dogmatic dialectic, of natural science.",13
442,"Accordingly, much of Volume I of the is taken up with the attempt to prove the dialectic as the universal method and the law of anthropology, superseding that which Kant had provided for analytical reason.",13
443,"Volume Two, Sartre announces, will then prove ‘the ’(I, 52):",13
444,"it will attempt to establish that there is human history, with truth and intelligibility — not by considering the material content of this history, but by demonstrating that a practical multiplicity, whatever it may be, must unceasingly totalise itself through interiorizing its multiplicity at all levels.",13
445,"(I, 69)",13
446,"The point, therefore, is to validate Marxism, to show that it is not simply a method of interpretation, nor even that it is the best method of interpretation that can most successfully account for the facts and the course of history, but to prove that history works dialectical structures, and to demonstrate ‘the moments of their inter-relations, the ever vaster and more complex movement which totalises them and, finally, the very direction of the totalization, , the ‘meaning of History’ and its Truth,(I, 69).",13
447,"Had he succeeded, Sartre would have established dialectical reason as successfully for the human sciences as Kant had established analytical reason for natural science.",13
448,But he was unable to do it.,13
449,The indetermination that he sought to banish increasingly returned to haunt him; he could never demonstrate how the unceasing totalization of multiplicity would ever reach its promised moment of finality.,13
450,Sartre's claim for the continued validity of Marxism as a method of understanding necessarily meant that he had to respond to the problem of Stalinism.,13
451,His was the first attempt to explain Stalinism as an aberration through the forms of Marxist analysis itself.,13
452,"reject Marxism on the grounds that it had been disproved by history, as Merleau-ponty had done, he sought to account for Stalinism through a dialectical analysis of the specific history of the Soviet Union since the Revolution: theory and practice, he argued, had become separated with the result that the former  had become ‘sclerosed’ while the latter had become ‘blind’and ‘unprincipled’(I, 50).",13
453,"Sartre, if the dialectic had become blocked, an understanding of its detour could nevertheless only be achieved through the use of a dialectical logic.",13
454,He therefore sought to prove both that the structures of history were necessarily dialectical and that the course of actual history could be shown to be so.,13
455,"But in attempting to discover why the Russian Revolution followed the path it did, he found himself arriving at the conclusion that, far from being a ‘false’ deviation, in the circumstances of history Stalinism had been necessary.",13
456,"Having set out to demonstrate how, through its understanding of the structure of history, Marxism was in a position to forecast the future, he came to the conclusion that there was no guarantee that history could promise anything better that what had just passed.",13
457,II THE FIRST ,13
458,"Unity had been easy during the Resistance, because relationships were almost always man-to-man.",13
459,"Over against the German army or the Vichy government, where social generality ruled, as it does in all machines of state, the Resistance offered the rare phenomenon of historical action which remained personal.",13
460,"The psychological and moral elements of political action were almost the only ones to appear here, which is why intellectuals least inclined to politics were to be seen in the Resistance.",13
461,"The Resistance was a unique experience for them, and they wanted to preserve its experience in the new French politics because this experience broke the famous dilemma of being and doing, which confronts all intellectuals in the face of action….",13
462,It is only too obvious that this balance between action and personal life was intimately bound up with the conditions of clandestine action and could not survive it.,13
463,"And in this sense it must be said that the Resistance experience, by making us believe that politics is a relationship between man and man or between consciousnesses, fostered our illusions of 1939 and masked the truth of the incredible power of history which the Occupation taught us in another connection.",13
464,"If by 1945 Merleau-ponty had here already indicated the historical basis for what was to become Sartre's project in the , the theoretical problem that followed was how to unite orthodox Marxist concepts of economic determinism and historical necessity with the individualism of Sartre's earlier work, that is the existentialist notion of the authentic self and the possibility of choosing one's own freedom: how to relocate human practice within historical determinism, to reconcile the individual with the social, the idea of agency with that of necessity, or freedom with history?",13
465,"For Marxist or Hegelian thought, such an age-old contradiction ought to be resolvable through the operations of dialectical logic.",13
466,"Citing Marx's famous remark in  , ‘Men make their own History…but under circumstances…given and transmitted from the past’, Sartre suggested that this implied ‘the permanent and dialectical unity of freedom and necessity,(I, 35).",13
467,"Accordingly, he attempted to shift Marxism orthodox theories of an absolute determinism towards the primacy of a concept of ‘History’ which, while still a totality as it had been for Lukács, a process with a determinate meaning and end, could also include a concept of human agency and thus articulate the individual with the social, freedom with determinism.",13
468,"Today, Sartre's voluntarism is to some extent returning to favour as the result of a desire to retrieve the categories of agency and the subject, which goes together with the wish to get the apparently totalizing systems of Adorno, Althusser or Foucault.",13
469,"Sartre's stress on the role of the subject also finds approval because many of those prepared to argue for a general theory of history as the progress of a single narrative of class-struggle, have begun to argue instead for a return of its correlative, the subject, almost it was the next best thing in the absence of history itself.",13
470,"But it still leaves us with the crucial problem that Sartre had to solve, namely how to link human consciousness with the processes of history the former can be said to be the agent of the latter.",13
471,How could this take place?,13
472,As Sartre had put it in ?:,13
473,‘Never has better understood that he has history and never has he felt so powerless before history’.,13
474,How can man make history if at the same time it is history which makes him?,13
475,"Sartre considered that orthodox dialectical materialism takes the easy way out by merely eliminating the first the second, making man a passive product entirely determined by economic circumstances.",13
476,"Unwilling to follow Merleau-Ponty by dropping the second the first, Sartre argued that it was possible for man to be both through the movement of , that is intentional actions which produce material effects.",13
477,"Its corollary, whereby praxis becomes determining history, he called the ‘practico-inert’, by which he meant the material circumstances that have themselves been created by previous praxes and which form the conditions for new praxis.",13
478,"The individual is thus both totalizer and totalized, deftly uniting freedom with necessity.",13
479,"Though this neatly solves the problem of how man can make history while at the same time history makes him, it does not answer the larger question of how a multiplicity of the products of individual acts, ‘totalizations’, can themselves be totalized into the overall totalization required by the logic of dialectical rationality — being the arbitrary, blind and self-cancelling movements of, say, Hardy's immanent will.",13
480,"Sartre's fundamental thesis, that ‘History continually effects totalisations of totalisations’(I, 15), does not in itself answer what Ronald Aronson has rightly characterized as question for Sartre: ‘how do separate, antagonistic actions yield history; how do individual totalizations lead to Totalization (and also progress, the direction of history, its truth and its meaning)?’",13
481,"For the whole basis of Sartre's argument is that the dialectic of history is not a metaphysical law, ‘some powerful unitary force revealing itself behind History like the will of God’, but the continuously produced effect of individual conflicts; each action is in its turn subsumed as a part of the whole in an ever broader, developing totalization (I, 37).",13
482,"What Sartre needs to demonstrate, therefore, is that if the law of the dialectic works from the individual level, overall it produces nothing less than the intelligibility or the meaning of History as such:",13
483,"The dialectic is the law of totalization which creates collectivities,societies, and history — realities, , which impose themselves on individuals; but at the same time it must be woven millions of individual actions.",13
484,We must show that it is possible for it to be both a …and a …how it can continually bring about the unity of dispersive profusion and integration.,13
485,"(I, 36)",13
486,But what produces the overall direction of History?,13
487,How does it ‘continually bring about the unity of dispersive profusion and integration’?,13
488,"Sartre does not attempt to answer this question, shifting rather to the notion of a lack of self-consciousness.",13
489,The dialectic is the law that remains hidden.,13
490,"At the moment, ‘history is made without being known history constitutes, we might say today, a political unconscious.",13
491,"‘Marxism’, on the other hand, Sartre claims, ‘is History itself becoming conscious of itself’(I, 40): Lukács, it is by becoming conscious of itself as the subject of history that the working class will understand history's meaning — and so recognize itself as the meaning of history.",13
492,"While he suggests in apocalyptic tones in that this process of self-consciousness is beginning to take place, and that civil, foreign and colonial wars are becoming apparent as different forms of a single class struggle, Sartre also admits that the divorce between theory and praxis which ensued under Stalinism has generally prevented any clear self-consciousness among the masses.",13
493,"The ‘detour, of Stalinism is thus formalized as Marxism's own descent into its unconscious, resulting in a dream-work of heterogeneous histories that have eluded systematization and subsumption into the single meaning of Marxism's own reading of history.",13
494,"It is therefore, Sartre argues, our historical task to make it known, promoting not just the historical process as such, but also the general recognition whereby the plurality of the meanings of individual histories can be seen to combine to make one history, with one meaning — the ‘Truth of humanity’(I, 822).",13
495,"Sartre's account thus sets up the articulation of history, univocal meaning, and totality as the indissoluble set of elements required for the validation of Marxism, necessary to save it from its detour  from itself.",13
496,"The problem, however, remains how such universals are produced from the multiplicity of initiating individual praxes.",13
497,"If History is a history of conflict, how could it be both one and internally diversified without the inner moving principle of the dialectic?",13
498,"How can History be a unity if it is also conflictual, if each action is aimed at destroying the other and results in a double negation in which the original aims of each action have been destroyed by the other?",13
499,"If each action negates the aim of the other, where is the ‘unity’ totalized in the conflict?",13
500,How does History constantly totalize itself?,13
501,"(I, 817 — 18) Sartre arrives at what he calls ‘the real problem of History’, that is how there can be totalization without a totalizer, only at the very end of Volume I. It is not until the next volume, however, that he intends to show how individual actions, separate multiplicities, make up ‘human history, with truth and intelligibility’(I, 69).",13
502,"Throughout, Sartre has nevertheless taken it ‘for granted that such a totalisation is constantly developing both as History and as historical Truth’(I, 822).",13
503,"His History, therefore, is always in process: but its teleology of a final totalization always has to be assumed.",13
504,He thus asserts the Truth of History while constantly projecting forwards and deferring its proof.,13
505,But when the proof comes it also turns out to rest on the assumption that it is already true.,13
506,III THE SECOND :,13
507,‘We are trying to establish the ,13
508,Sartre produces a persuasive formulation of the relation of the individual to the determining historical circumstance through his concepts of praxis and the practico-inert; it is also obvious to him how the larger question of History ought to be solved.,13
509,"He asserts it often enough: ‘History continually effects totalisations of totalisations,(I, 15).",13
510,"But in Volume I of the , as we have seen, he continually defers the demonstration of his proof.",13
511,"For the ‘dogmatic dialectic’, as he describes dialectical materialism, the whole question naturally poses no problem, for each person or group simply constitutes a partial moment of an already operative movement of totalization that produces them and then goes beyond them.",13
512,"But Sartre's dispensing with all historicist schemas creates the problem of how, between two autonomous and contradictory totalizations, there could be ‘one dialectical intelligibility of the ongoing process’(II, 13).",13
513,"He attempts to solve this through matching his account of contradiction with a new concept derived from the conjunction of work and labour: ‘anti-labour’(), a category of negation.",13
514,"The products of a conflict, its residues, may seem incomprehensible they differ from the original intentions of any of the combatants.",13
515,Nevertheless they constitute the basis and conditions for further actions and history.,13
516,Dialectical reason encounters such products as undecidables:,13
517,— because they seem to be the results of a communal enterprise while at the same time bearing witness to the fact that this enterprise never existed except as the inhuman reverse side of two opposed actions in which each aims to destroy the other.,13
518,"In the dialectical perspective, we encounter these objects as productions which are human and provided with a future…thus they seem by themselves to be totalizations in process.",13
519,"(II, 20)",13
520,"This means that first, they lead to  results, and second, that the internal structure of social objects contains ‘the double negation of themselves and of each constituent part by the other’(II, 22).",13
521,"There is, therefore, before any understanding of historic agents and movements, a certain in all social ensembles: from afar they may appear whole, but close to, they can be seen as riddled with holes.",13
522,This increasingly comes to resemble nothing Sartre's own account of History.,13
523,"In the context of the negativity of this formulation, Sartre is obliged to pose the problem of whether there can be a totalization, without any independent totalizer or totalizing force the dialectic, or whether the structure of negation that he has described means that, Adorno or Bakhtin, history does not develop positively but, rather, negatively, and is therefore instead detotalizing:",13
524,"Marxism is rigorously true if History is totalization; it is not so any more if human history decomposes into a plurality of particular histories, or if, in any case, within the relationship of immanence that characterizes struggle, the negation of each adversary by the other is on principle .",13
525,"Certainly, we have neither the design nor the actual possibility of showing here the full truth of dialectical materialism…",13
526,"Our goal is solely to establish whether, in a practical ensemble torn apart by antagonism (whether there are multiple conflicts or whether they are reduced to one) the breaks themselves are totalizing and carried along by the totalizing movement of the ensemble.",13
527,"(II, 25)",13
528,"At this point Sartre confronts the possibility that the whole project of the , stated so confidently on its very first page —‘it must be proved that a negation of a negation can be an affirmation’(I, 15)— may break down.",13
529,perhaps the Truth of History cannot be proved; its direction cannot be discerned.,13
530,"Sartre's reaction to the threat that the negation of a negation may produce a detotalizing effect is to introduce a new category, a unifying force of a ‘singularization’ which incarnates the universal: ‘If totalization really is an ongoing process’, he writes, ‘then it operates everywhere.",13
531,"That means both that there is a dialectical meaning of the practical ensemble…and that each singular event totalizes in itself the practical ensemble in the infinite richness of its singularity’(II, 26).",13
532,"Unlike Lukács' insignificant event from which the  universal is precariously drawn out through the narrative, Sartre's singularity works synecdochally in a conventional antinomy with the universal, the relation between the two structured the familiar nineteenth-century model of organic growth or process in which each singular event makes up the whole while, as he puts it, ‘the whole is entirely present in the part as its present meaning and as its destiny’.",13
533,"Sartre's ‘singular universal’, therefore, begs the question, for it is predicated on the assumption that, if there is not a totality as such, then there already is an overall totalization: ‘If totalization really is an ongoing process…’.",13
534,"That developing process is itself totalized through Sartre's assertion that each totalization is the totalization of all struggles, as it must be if the singular is to incarnate the universal.",13
535,The concept of the singular universal thus facilitates a circularity in the argument whereby Sartre can avoid the question which he began by posing.,13
536,So the singular universal presumes the totalization he can't (yet) prove.,13
537,"This strategy marks a structure of repetition in Sartre's text: each time he poses the question of how there can be totalization of History without a totalizer, he retreats to a more limited example whose unity is already evident, but which in the end only brings him back to the original question again.",13
538,"In this case Sartre demonstrates how the singular universal works, by appealing to the concrete example of a boxing match — a random exemplification that just happens to reproduce the single adversaries of the master/slave dialectic.",13
539,"Its totalization takes place through its incarnation, as part of the totality of boxing, in the overall framework within which each individual fight occurs.",13
540,"Each boxing match, Sartre claims, must be both a unique event and also in some sense the incarnation of all boxing, whose rules and conventions it follows, and whose past and future history it sets itself against.",13
541,"But it is also apparent that that totality is not completely known, nor is its future shape even presumed.",13
542,"By totalization, therefore, Sartre does not here mean anything like a predetermined end or final closure of a totality but rather a process of mediation among the parts, where each is determined by the other.",13
543,"can predict the future of boxing, either at the level of particular victories or defeats, in effect a structure of repetition, nor at the more general level of possible modifications or developments of the sport.",13
544,"Yet each individual bout articulates itself within the framework of the history of boxing, known and unknown.",13
545,This allows Sartre to include chance and contingency in his scheme.,13
546,"Since it cannot be known as a concept that will realize itself in the future, Sartre argues instead that the totality only produces itself in the moment: ‘The incarnation as such is at once unrealizable except as totalization of everything and irreducible to a pure abstract unity of that which it totalizes’(II, 58).",13
547,"The universal, the totality, can only be known through the singular.",13
548,But its future direction remains unknown and indeterminate.,13
549,"At the same time Sartre makes a larger, though less persuasive claim that  the boxing-match also works synecdochally and re-exteriorizes a more fundamental violence, namely the interiorized condition of scarcity that he considers to be the basis of conflict .",13
550,"The boxing match ‘is the public incarnation of conflict’(II, 32), totalizing in its own struggle the whole of ‘contemporary irreducibilities and fissures’(II, 26):",13
551,"thus one can and must say…that each fight is the singularisation of all of the social whole in movement and that by this singularisation, it incarnates the enveloping totalization which the historical process is.",13
552,"(II, 58)",13
553,"But then he adds, ‘I have said and I repeat that we have not yet proved that this enveloping totalization exists’.",13
554,"So, although it is possible to conceive of any event as an incarnation of the totality, it must itself make up a part of that totality in its determination, unlike the case of the boxing match, where we can define the overall entity ‘boxing’, it still remains unproven that an overall entity, ‘History’, can be said to exist .",13
555,"For all his use of the model of the boxing match, Sartre has really got no further with the fundamental question of how there can be totalization without a totalizer.",13
556,"It is simple enough for him to show that a boxing match takes place within a general totality of ‘boxing’, which is itself only ever present in any individual incarnation, for as a game each match is both an individual bout and something conducted general rules and a specific social tradition.",13
557,"But what about those conflicts that do not take place within such a constituted social system, such as conflictual bourgeois societies which cannot be said to be unified, except, as Sartre suggests dismissively, by appeal to a lost paradise before the class struggle?",13
558,"Such societies make the conflicts of history irreducible to Sartre's logic unless, like the boxing match, they can be shown to take part in a larger totalizable category.",13
559,"However, when he poses the question of whether his method could work for the class struggle the boxing match, Sartre admits that he finds it impossible to answer and returns instead to the much easier case of sub-groups.",13
560,he backtracks and assumes a larger unity in which conflict takes place.,13
561,"The major question thus always remains unanswered in the : every time that Sartre announces that he is about to proceed with the fundamental problem of how History can be a totalization without a totalizer, he turns back to a previous, more easily intelligible stage on the way.",13
562,"His difficulty is accompanied by a symptomatic increasing distrust of universals , in championing specificities against them, he seems to give up the attempt to validate the universals — History as Totalization — that originally formed the object of his project.",13
563,"At this point a further contradiction in Sartre's whole enterprise begins to open up: for someone so deeply distrustful of universals it seems curious that he has involved himself so emphatically with the notions of totality, History, and  the dialectic.",13
564,"As Sartre insists more and more upon the virtues of specificity (II, 200 — 05), such is his distaste for Marxist or any other universalizing categories that he refuses even to countenance them, attempting to replace concepts with specificities, universals with singulars.",13
565,"His scepticism goes to the extent of even denying the existence of ‘society’ or ‘the nation’as such (II, 24, 61)— the very totalities which his own general argument for totalization requires.",13
566,"Here certain similarities with later ‘post-Marxist’ theorists Foucault or Lyotard, begin to become apparent.",13
567,But if Sartre anticipates such later thinkers we should not assume too quickly that they have simply taken his insights further.,13
568,"For Sartre's singular universal could never be expected to solve the formal theoretical problem of how individual existential existence can be related to History it simply renames, in one oxymoronic category, the original antithetical terms.",13
569,"Without an adequate theory of their articulation, they simply begin to separate again.",13
570,IV THE AMBIVALENCE OF HISTORY,13
571,"The ‘singular universal’, with its organicist and essentialist overtones whereby the part incarnates the whole, is thus the product of Sartre's hesitation between the singular, which remains privileged as the existential basis of history, and the universal which as a Marxist he feels is required for its intelligibility and validation.",13
572,The effect of Sartre's oscillation between these two poles is that his argument is increasingly drawn towards the very positions that ostensibly he wishes to refute.,13
573,"So, , he compulsively returns to the idea that history might consist of several totalizations one:",13
574,"Might not History, at the level of the grand ensembles, be an ambiguous interpenetration of unity and plurality, of dialectic and anti-dialectic, of sense and nonsense?",13
575,"Might there not be, the circumstances and the particular ensemble,totalizations without any links between them except coexistence or other exterior link?",13
576,"(II, 131)",13
577,"this point, Sartre's notion of conflict has operated in direct antithesis to that of Bakhtin: whereas for Sartre, struggles are totalizing, always creating a larger, meaningful and developing whole multiplicities, for Bakhtin they are detotalizing, dissolving ‘previous totalisations’.",13
578,But Sartre's own text here develops a dialogism in the tension between these two possibilities which becomes an increasingly dominant characteristic of his regressive-progressive method and ends up by detotalizing the very totalization which he sought to prove.,13
579,"Here we find the theoretical corollary of what Althusser was to characterize as the tragic ‘double thesis’ of Sartre's ‘historicist humanism’, and which produced, in Michael Sprinker's words, a ‘ceaseless rebounding  between the poles of revolutionary optimism and historical pessimism’.",13
580,"Sartre himself theorizes this growing ambivalence as the difference between his own method and that of orthodox Marxism, elaborating the distinction between concept and incarnation as two possible paths of a dialectical understanding of the same social reality.",13
581,"The concept, as employed by orthodox Marxism, goes from the singular to the universal and therefore, Sartre claims, detotalizes in a movement of ‘decompressive expansion’, whereas incarnation involves ‘a way of totalizing compression which, on the contrary, seizes the centripetal movement of all the significations drawn in and condensed in the event or in the object’(II, 59).",13
582,But it is rather Sartre's own text that seems to be caught between these two dialectical possibilities of expansion and compression in a double logic.,13
583,"Thus the very concept of totalization, distinguished from totality, must always be refused its prospective closure, for if ‘History continually effects totalisation of totalisations’(I, 15) it must necessarily also mean that by definition it can never be absolutely totalized.",13
584,As he puts it in : ‘For us the reality of the collective object rests on .,13
585,It demonstrates that the totalization is never achieved and that the totality exists only in the form of a .’,13
586,How then can history totalize totalization if totalization is never accomplished?,13
587,"This is the point at which the dialectic, as a unity of method and movement, of subject and object, knower and known, requires the writing subject who must effectively hold them together.",13
588,Thus the critical investigation,13
589,"takes place the totalisation and can be neither a contemplative recognition of the totalising movement, nor a particular, autonomous totalisation of the known totalisation.",13
590,Rather it is a real moment of the developing totalisation…,13
591,"(I, 48)",13
592,This means that the process of totalization must be kept moving by the critical investigation itself on which it comes to depend but which by the same token it can never subsume.,13
593,"Every time that Sartre asserts the enveloping movement of the historical process, while adding emphatically that he has yet not proved that such a totalization exists, he must always simultaneously introduce a counterstructure of repetition, his argument seems to fluctuate, like the groups that he describes, ‘in a state of perpetual ’(I, 579).",13
594,"This is why although he dares to pose his overwhelming question, he can never be in a position to answer it with more than an assertion and the promise of more totalizations.",13
595,The indetermination he sought to excise returns to govern him.,13
596,The can do nothing but proliferate extravagantly into the writing of a perpetual process of deferral.,13
597,"If the singular universal increasingly punctuates the forward movement of Sartre's text providing it with a dialectical meaning and direction, the problem that it was invoked to solve meanwhile takes its own aberrant course.",13
598,"Denying that conflict is an structure actualized in historical  struggle, we have seen that Sartre does explain, through the category of the ‘practico-inert’(determining material conditions which have themselves been created by previous praxis), how individuals or classes in conflict produce a historical movement to which they are then subject.",13
599,"Actions, in turn, create the conditions for their own contradiction when the successful fulfilment of praxis is prevented by the action of another praxis whose aims conflict with it.",13
600,"The fact that conflict produces anti-labour, or a contingent situation that was not the original aim of either conflictual group, must mean that in this schema History has a negative unity, notwithstanding the troubled formulation of the singular-universal.",13
601,"If Sartre denies all possibility both of an underlying historical structure and of a larger unity, a ‘hyper-organism’ as he puts it, within which conflict takes place, then history as he conceptualizes it here has no specific or necessary direction.",13
602,"More seriously, it suggests that history will always deviate from any intended route and take an unforeseen one instead.",13
603,"If political struggle takes place for specific purposes and anticipated results, here Sartre seems to condemn it to an unending series of detours that will never arrive at their destination.",13
604,"‘History’ names the horizon of totalization of those ethico-political meanings that point in the direction of social change, it here not only loses its single meaning, but threatens to lose even the bases on which its meaning is constituted.",13
605,"Sartre, therefore, cannot after all be said to substitute a simple voluntarism for an underlying historical structure.",13
606,In the second Sartre seems remarkably equivocal his central question of how struggles which have no controlling totalizer or underlying structure of totalization can be intelligible.,13
607,"He begins by allowing the possibility of schism, that which took place in the Roman Empire (II, 84), which implies that humans can choose not to allow totalization.",13
608,"He then admits that the result of any conflict, though it may be intelligible, may not necessarily imply any progress.",13
609,"Progress or improvement is no more likely than decline: he now repeatedly disowns any necessary historical logic of progress; its incarnations will always, strictly speaking, be accidental ones the objectives which were at the origin of praxis:",13
610,"[History]is not rigorous because it always proceeds by faults and corrections, because it is not a universal schema but a unique adventure that unfolds on the basis of prehistoric circumstances which constitute in themselves, and all the objectives and all the practices, a heavy and badly understood legacy of fundamental deviations.",13
611,"(II, 238)",13
612,History therefore does have a structure of sorts — a legacy of continual aberration.,13
613,"By abandoning any logic of progress for the negative synthesis of anti-labour which produces deviation, Sartre is, on the other hand, able to  account for the major detour that provides the context for his whole debate with Merleau-Ponty, and indeed for all post-war Marxism: the spectre of Stalinism.",13
614,"The problem, however, is that though Sartre produces a provocative analysis of why Stalin was successful, this imperceptibly slides into an account of why Stalin had to do what he did, to the extent that Sartre appears to justify his actions the particular necessities of his historical circumstances.",13
615,Thus Sartre argues that it was necessary to choose between the break-up of the Revolution and its deviation.,13
616,"Stalinism, in fact, accords all too perfectly with the perverse structures of Sartre's own theoretical argument.",13
617,"It also serves, appropriately enough, as a way of closing down the aporias which have opened up in Sartre's text.",13
618,Sartre takes the slogan ‘socialism in one country’ as an example of the unintended but necessary product of the anti-labour of the Stalin-Trotsky conflict.,13
619,"He translates the ‘socialism in one country’ of the one versus the ‘internationalism’of the other into a conflict between his own, now reified and separated, terms of concrete incarnation and abstract universalism:, the revolutionary incarnation chose the singular against the universal and the national against the international' (II, 223).",13
620,"Stalin therefore becomes the authentic Marxist, able to deal with specific historical circumstances, Trotsky who is regarded as having been hopelessly caught up with the universalism of an abstract Marxism.",13
621,"Sartre, the Revolution's ‘incarnation directly contradicts its universalization,(II, 116).",13
622,"If he therefore demonstrates why socialism in one country was historically necessary, he ends up by apparently justifying Stalinism: in showing how anti-labour produces deviation, he seems to endorse its course while rejecting any overall schema which can provide the basis of a claim that it will be ultimately corrected.",13
623,"The analysis stops at the point where even Stalin's anti-semitism begins to appear necessary (II, 281).",13
624,Sartre never broaches the question of the other crimes committed by Stalin (which is just as well the way the argument is going) nor does he address the obvious problem that his own identification of Stalin as the practical Marxist of specificities against Trotsky's abstract universalism runs directly counter to the fact that Stalinism produced the most clear-cut example of a Marxism which internalized an abstract schema within itself.,13
625,"Instead, at this point Sartre abandons all hope of proving History as a totalization without a totalizer.",13
626,"He moves into a long attempt, which takes up the rest of the book, to revise the earlier ontology of into a new ontology of action and even of History, , after all, he is investigating the prospect of accrediting the latter with ontological status — a possibility which has always haunted his text in its insistent negation.",13
627,"This analysis, though lengthy, remains incomplete.",13
628,"In studying the deviation, Sartre himself deviated from his original project.",13
629,"But this was not just the effect of Stalin , despite his perverse attraction as a sort of singular-universal who did in effect unite ‘man’ with ‘history’: it was also the result of the  theoretical collapse of the singular-universal as a totalizing concept that could save history from the aberrant consequences of anti-labour.",13
630,"Sartre's philosophical grounding of ‘History’, therefore, foundered in the second volume when the logic of history inexorably brought him, not to totalization without a totalizer, but to the very reverse: the figure of Stalin and the conclusion that Stalinism had been indispensable for the development of socialism in the Soviet Union.",13
631,"Although the had been intended to rescue Marxism from the sclerosis of Stalinism, Sartre found that his theory of history, far from explaining what had gone wrong when the most radical political theory turned out in practice to be one of the most oppressive, had rather shown why it had necessarily happened that way.",13
632,"Volume II was never completed, and only published, unfinished, in 1985.",13
633,Thus Sartre's attempt to prove the truth of Marxism and of History at a philosophical level was abandoned.,13
634,"The basic theoretical problem had been to show how two or more autonomous and contradictory totalizations make up one dialectical intelligibility: to do this he needed to totalize the classes in struggle, and to discover the synthetic unity of a conflictual society.",13
635,The articulation of individual with History stood or fell with the concept of history as totalization without a totalizer.,13
636,"The stakes had been painfully clear to Sartre himself: ‘Marxism is rigorously true if History is totalization; it is not so any more if human history decomposes into a plurality of particular histories’(II, 25).",13
637,"The problem was that the premises of his own theory required the answer to this question to remain always in abeyance, while his text enacts resolves the equivocality of the choice which it sets up.",13
638,"If Sartre began by attempting to unite man with history, in the notes at the very end of the manuscript he poses the fundamental ontological question, and immediately follows it with a decidedly unequivocal answer:",13
639,IS HISTORY ESSENTIAL TO MAN?,13
640,No.,13
641,"(II, 454)",13
642,"Sartre's argument for History as totalization, then, was already caught up in interminable difficulties by the time he was drafting Volume II of the in 1958.",13
643,"No sooner had he published Volume I in 1960 than the whole status that he claimed for History, for man, and for their articulation, came under attack.",13
644,V HISTORY AND ETHNOCENTRICITY,13
645,The case of Sartre demonstrates why the assertion of ‘history’ against structuralism and poststructuralism must always remain problematical.,13
646,"In this context it is ironic that it was a structuralist critique of Sartre's claims for history that, in historical terms, brought about the abrupt intellectual demise of existential Marxism itself.",13
647,"Lévi-Strauss' famous objections to  Sartre, which appeared in the last chapter of (1962), are sometimes represented they were merely a structuralist attack on Marxism.",13
648,But their immediate occasion was as a response to the use that Sartre himself had made of Lévi-Strauss' (1949) in the first .,13
649,Sartre had stated that,13
650,"If there is to be any such thing as the Truth of History (truths, they are organized into a system), our investigation must show that the kind of dialectical intelligibility which we have described…applies to the process of human history as a whole",13
651,"(I, 64).",13
652,"For Sartre ‘human history’ was identified with the history of the West, and it was for this reason that Lévi-Strauss contested Sartre's claim to have established the human foundation of ‘a structural, historical anthropology’for Marxism.",13
653,"In retrospect, it was highly significant that resistance to Sartre's ‘History’ began by drawing attention to its ethnocentrism and Eurocentrism.",13
654,"Lévi-Strauss' critique of Sartre effectively takes the form of a deconstructive analysis: he begins by arguing that the works by a double movement — just as, only four years later, Derrida was to suggest that the anthropologist's own work functions in exactly the same way.",13
655,"Lévi-Strauss focuses on the ambivalence which we have already seen to be such a distinctive feature of the , pointing to Sartre's vacillation between two concepts of dialectical reason.",13
656,"In the first he regards it as antithetical to analytical reason, as truth to error, while in the second he sees it as complementary to it.",13
657,"If this is the case, then Lévi-Strauss argues that Sartre disqualifies his own , which establishes the truth of dialectical reason partly through the exercise of analytical reason, as any critique, which separates subject from object, knower from known, inevitably must.",13
658,"But then ‘it is difficult to see how analytical reason could be applied to dialectical reason and claim to establish it, if the two are defined by mutually exclusive characteristics’.",13
659,"Moreover, if the two eventually arrive at the same truth anyway then there seems to be little need for dialectical reason .",13
660,‘Sartre's endeavour seems contradictory in the one case and superfluous in the other’(246).,13
661,"While stressing that they both take their point of departure from Marx, Lévi-Strauss suggests that for him Marxism implies that",13
662,"the opposition between the two sorts of reason is relative, not absolute.",13
663,"It corresponds to a tension within human thought which may persist indefinitely , but which has no basis .",13
664,(246),13
665,"The two forms of reason do not exist independently of , as different forms of reality, but exist in an economy comparable to Derrida's differential ‘stricture’.",13
666,"Unknown to Lévi-Strauss, Sartre himself had already proposed that dialectical understanding itself works along two paths, one of ‘expansion’ and one of ‘compression’, which  suggests that having separated dialectical from analytical reason, he had then to reintroduce the latter under a new guise.",13
667,"The argument about the relation of the different kinds of reason to will doubtless (and necessarily) continue without resolution; what is important in the present context is that, in rearticulating the possibility that there is no absolute difference between the two, Lévi-Strauss puts into question Sartre's definitions of man, human history, and finally his concept of history — all of which are predicated on the dialectic.",13
668,"If conflict is the motive force of history, and history a series of progressive dialectical totalizations, then Sartre claims that what he calls ‘backward societies’ have existed in a state of equilibrium and are therefore without history.",13
669,He writes:,13
670,"There is no logical (dialectical) absurdity in the idea of a country with no History, where human groups would vegetate and never break a cycle of repetition, producing their lives with primitive techniques and instruments and knowing absolutely nothing of ",13
671,"(I, 126).",13
672,In the background here is Hegel.,13
673,"Sartre, history is only born from a sudden imbalance of scarcity which disrupts all levels of society and initiates conflict and therefore progression.",13
674,Many have objected that this analysis is hardly Marxist — Marxism takes the form of an analysis of the misappropriation of surplus value.,13
675,"But Lévi-Strauss rather objects to the ethnocentrism of Sartre's argument, for it means that ‘man’, the constituents of whom should have been the result and product of Sartre's anthropology, is defined in advance the dialectic as historical humanity, with history effectively restricted to societies of the West.",13
676,The rest are excluded.,13
677,"It is exactly this assumption, however, that shows the extent to which Western society is indistinguishable from all other cultures, for each, Lévi-Strauss, has always assumed that it represents the full meaning and significance of human society:",13
678,"a good deal of egocentricity and naivety is necessary to believe that man has taken refuge in a single one of the historical or geographical modes of his existence, when the truth about man resides in the system of their differences and common properties.",13
679,(249),13
680,Sartre's ethnocentricity derives from the whole project of his existentialism and his phenomenological definition of man the experiencing self defined against an other.,13
681,Lévi-Strauss suggests that as a science anthropology should be attempting not to provide a definition of man as he is known experientially in our own society — an unscientific subjectivism — but should rather begin by ‘dissolving’ him.,13
682,"Here we encounter the first attempt to undo the category of ‘man’, an enterprise which has caused more distress than most in the recent history of the social sciences.",13
683,"Lévi-Strauss' point here, however, is simply the objection that Sartre defines ‘man’ in  advance, predetermined by the particular experience of what it is to be a man in twentieth-century post-war French society.",13
684,"The assumption that one's own experience, one's own gender, one's own society, constitutes the sole reality is in fact the very antithesis of the whole concept of any anthropology.",13
685,"Sartre, as Simon Clarke argues, ‘takes the conscious rationalization of his own culture for the ultimate meaning of humanity’.",13
686,But how can Sartre claim to found a general anthropology when he defines it solely his own society?,13
687,"Lévi-Strauss shows that the experience on which Sartre bases his philosophy is not a universal one, then the general inferences for all humanity that he draws from it can be justified.",13
688,Sartre's existential consciousness cannot be dehistoricized into a general foundation for a concept of History.,13
689,"Having questioned the basis of Sartre's definition of man and the human the categories of civilization and primitivism, Lévi-Strauss focuses on this relation to history.",13
690,"It cannot, he argues, be tied to the notion of ‘man’ they were images of :",13
691,We need only recognize that history is a method with no distinct object corresponding to it to reject the equivalence between the notion of history and the notion of humanity which some have tried to foist on us with the unavowed aim of making historicity the last refuge of a transcendental humanism: men could regain the illusion of liberty on the plane of the ‘we’ merely by giving up the ‘I's that are too obviously wanting in consistency.,13
692,(262),13
693,"In other words, Sartre's attempt to combine Marxism with existentialist subjectivity cannot resolve its difficulties through a shift from economism to history, for history implicitly continues to fulfil the same function anyway.",13
694,"Here Lévi-Strauss argues that behind the original question from which Sartre began — how can man make history if history makes him?— lurks another: if it is man who makes history, how does ‘History’ gain its exorbitant status as the desired, unachievable object of Sartre's text?",13
695,His emphasis on the primacy of history means that he forms ‘an almost mystical conception of it’.,13
696,Sartre seems to have remembered only half of Marx's and Freud's combined lesson.,13
697,They have taught us that man has meaning only on the condition that he view himself as meaningful.,13
698,So far I agree with Sartre.,13
699,But it must be added that : superstructures are which have ‘made it’ socially.,13
700,Hence it is vain to go to historical consciousness for the truest meaning.,13
701,(253),13
702,"Historical consciousness is necessarily ideological, dialectical, and can never in itself provide the one true meaning of history.",13
703,"Despite Sartre's reiteration that it is man who makes it, history increasingly assumes its own ontological status in the .",13
704,"Above all, Lévi-Strauss questions its status as totalization.",13
705,The idea of history as the totalization of totalizations does not work.,13
706,"How total, he asks in a critique of totalization which Derrida would characterize as his first ‘classical’ formulation, can the totalization be?",13
707,Can it include every historical fact?,13
708,"History names the process of constituting historical facts, and, particularly, of their selection.",13
709,A history that included everything would amount to chaos:,13
710,"history aspires to meaning, it is doomed to select regions, periods, groups of men and individuals in these groups and to make them stand out, as discontinuous figures, against a continuity barely good enough to be used as a backdrop.",13
711,A truly total history would cancel itself out — its product would be nought.,13
712,(257),13
713,"Meaning works through a form of metonymy, distinguishing between elements significance and insignificance, and that is why it must always be partial any text it interprets.",13
714,"(We might compare this to the way in which, in Sartre's later text, the synecdoche of the singular-universal insistently slides into the singularity of the event).",13
715,"Totalization in the first , Lévi-Strauss suggests, can only create its meaning by selection through such metonymic devices of exclusion, , by founding itself on an — ethnocentric — absence.",13
716,Historical consciousness dehistoricizes by shifting diachrony into a single synchronic totality:,13
717,"And so we end up in the paradox of a system which invokes the criterion of historical consciousness as a means for distinguishing the ‘primitive’ from the, civilized' but — its claim — is itself ahistorical.",13
718,It offers not a concrete image of history but an abstract schema of men making history of such a kind that it can manifest itself in the trend of their lives as a synchronic totality.,13
719,"Its position history is therefore the same as that of primitives to the eternal past: in Sartre's system, history plays exactly the part of a myth.",13
720,(254),13
721,"History, far from constituting a privileged form of (historical) knowledge, is simply the myth of modern man, and merely amounts to a method of analysis.",13
722,"For all its stress on history and totalization as process, Sartre's argument is structured through the creation of a form of synchronicity.",13
723,Lévi-Strauss demonstrates this through his well-known discussion of the function of the category of time.,13
724,"Like all models of knowledge, he suggests, history requires a code to analyse its object, and for most historians this code consists in chronology.",13
725,"The use of chronology in historical writing, or in literary history, gives the illusion that the whole operates by a uniform, continuous progression, a linear series in which each event takes its place.",13
726,History is thus a process of a continuous unfolding.,13
727,"But in fact, Lévi-Strauss argues, the process model of  history is an illusion, for even dates do not work like that.",13
728,Dates only work by being a member of a class.,13
729,"In itself, a date tells us nothing: it only takes on meaning when it is part of a series.",13
730,"However that class does not necessarily correspond to other sets of dates, periods, millennia, ages, etc.",13
731,"History is a discontinuous set composed of domains of history, each of which is defined by a characteristic frequency and by a differential coding of and .",13
732,It is no more possible to pass between the dates which compose the different domains than it is to do so between natural and irrational numbers.,13
733,Or more precisely: the dates appropriate to each class are irrational to all those of other classes.,13
734,(259 — 60),13
735,So-called historical continuity is therefore often fraudulently constructed discontinuous sets which each have different temporalities.,13
736,"History can neither be total, nor a simple series of facts, nor a continuity.",13
737,The fact that it must always involve codification and therefore also interpretation means that ‘historical knowledge has no claim to be opposed to other forms of knowledge as a supremely privileged one’(263).,13
738,Historicity is a mode of knowledge for some societies but cannot claim to be the fundamental basis of knowledge for all of them — a point that was to be re-emphasized by Foucault in .,13
739,It is thus far from the case that the search for intelligibility comes to an end with history as such.,13
740,Lévi-Strauss therefore makes three major criticisms of Sartre's concept of history.,13
741,"In the first place, he contests its equation with any anthropological definition of ‘man’; in the second, he argues that Sartre's description of history as making up one ‘History’ with one meaning is only achieved through the exclusion of all other histories with other meanings: the totalization can only totalize if everything which remains other to it is excluded.",13
742,Sartre's definition is therefore tautological: it is one history because it is (only) one history.,13
743,"Specifically, Sartre creates a single history by excluding all histories of the West; his history as totalization can therefore only work through a determined ethnocentricity.",13
744,"In the third place, even in its own terms, the concept of history as a continuous development, a progressive totalization of totalizations, is dependent on a notion of chronology which assumes a synchronic homogeneous notion of time.",13
745,"But even historical chronology works through discontinuous sets, the elements in each class being defined only differentially the others in its class.",13
746,This final criticism amounts to the challenge that Sartre's history can only ever be theorized as totalization it has been conceptualized as a synchronic form.,13
747,"While the criticism that Lévi-Strauss, structuralism emphasizes the synchronic at the expense of the diachronic has assumed the status of a critical truism, this in fact repeats the substance of his critique of Sartre, namely that the latter attempted to transform history into a space of synchronicity.",13
748,Indeed totality in both presupposes a homogeneous temporality: the singular universal could only  ever work by presupposing what Althusser would call an ‘essential section’.,13
749,"Lévi-Strauss himself, like Althusser and Foucault, was preoccupied with the conceptualization of forms of heterogeneous temporality that consistently elude and trouble all theorization of history as a homogeneous diachrony.",13
750,"Lévi-Strauss' attack, together with Sartre's own theoretical difficulties which have already been charted, was effective enough to be quite devastating to the project of the — which was never completed.",13
751,"Sartre took four years to respond, and when the reply eventually came even his most sympathetic admirers agreed that it did not succeed in answering the main criticisms.",13
752,"Lévi-Strauss' objections to Sartre's theory of history on the grounds of its ethnocentrism was certainly to the point, demonstrating that one lesson of Sartre's Herculean attempt to make history truth, and to give it one meaning, was the relation of such history to Western cultural imperialism.",13
753,"At the same time we should also recall that, as Levinas puts it ‘the best thing about philosophy is that it fails’.",13
754,"To the extent that Sartre's ontology does not succeed in totalizing history, it remains open to its irreducible otherness.",13
755,"perhaps this is one reason why, despite the Eurocentrism of his intended historical schema, Sartre himself could certainly not be accused of ethnocentrism in his politics; already the first contains substantial analyses of the political and psychological structures of colonialism and racism, they have to be, as always, ‘dissolved ’(I, 716).",13
756,"But this still allows Sartre to argue, , for the legitimacy of the use of violence by colonized peoples against their oppressors, thus anticipating Fanon's dictum that colonization was achieved by violence and must therefore be overcome with it.",13
757,"Aronson sees Sartre's turn to the cause of resisting colonial oppression as an act of ‘self-flagellation’ and a product of politico-theoretical despair, but this passes over the historical and political context in which Sartre, and , played a leading role in the opposition to the Algerian war.",13
758,"In retrospect these concerns now seem a much bolder move, constituting an important political lead which was to be continued in the resistance to the war in South-East Asia in the sixties and early seventies.",13
759,But Sartre's courageous intervention against French and other colonialisms could not have a corresponding theoretical impact he retained his historicist Marxist framework.,13
760,For his unitary theory of history has the effect of disallowing radical attempts at rewriting or retrieving other histories excluded by the West.,13
761,"Although it was taken by many as an attack on history as such, it was the critique of Marxist historicism initiated by Althusser that enabled new political possibilities in this direction.",13
762,The scientific critique of historicism,13
763,"Before Sartre had even replied to Levi-Strauss criticisms, Althusser had published (1965), a work which, together with the later volume (1968), far from defending Sartre's Marxism from the structuralist challenge, completed the move against it, and offered a new interpretation of Marxism from which humanist existentialism and Hegelianism had been resolutely purged, with Sartre's voluntarism replaced by a more mediated form of economism.",13
764,"It is easy to represent Althusser's intervention purely structuralism, but to suggest that this was its only significant intellectual context is misleading.",13
765,"If his work needs to be considered in the context of the contemporary politics of the Communist Party, as several commentators have stressed, it also requires reference to work done in the history of the sciences, particularly that of Gaston Bachelard in the history of physics and chemistry, his pupil Georges Canguilhem in the life sciences, and Jean Cavaillès in mathematics.",13
766,"All four, together with Althusser's pupil, Michel Foucault, worked within an epistemological tradition which was critical of the positivism which, that time, had dominated the history of the sciences.",13
767,To represent Althusser's work purely as a ‘structural Marxism’ therefore passes over the fact that there were distinct intellectual traditions in France whose difference was particularly pronounced in their respective philosophies of history.,13
768,Much of what has been considered to be poststructuralism's wild disregard for history can be accounted for by the fact that it was operating within this — largely unknown outside France — anti-empiricist and anti-positivist tradition.,13
769,"In 1978 Foucault suggested that post-war French philosophy divides a line ‘which separates a philosophy of experience, meaning and the subject from a philosophy of , rationality and the concept’: in other words, Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, against Cavaillès, Bachelard and Canguilhem, or the return-to-Hegel of Kojève in the thirties, versus the return-to-Rant initiated in the philosophy of the sciences by Léon Brunschvicg in the late nineteenth century.",13
770,"Long before Sartre developed his own form of Marxist-Hegelian history, Bachelard had been working in a critical relation to Hegelian historicism.",13
771,What was new in Althusser was that for the first time this epistemological tradition was developed for a Marxism.,13
772,"Against Sartre's claim to establish Marxism's truth philosophically, Althusser reasoned that if Marxism is a science, then the history of Marxism ought to conform to the kind of history that had been developed for the sciences.",13
773,The question then simply became whether it did or not.,13
774,Or so it seemed.,13
775,"The difficulties in which Althusser subsequently became enmeshed were the result of his ignoring Canguilhem's warning that although the history of science takes science for its object, it is not itself a science, and therefore cannot claim to be value-free (or, in Marxist terms, non-ideological).",13
776,"As Gregory Elliott has recently emphasized, although Althusser always presented himself as the figure of the rigours of orthodoxy against the eclecticism of the existentialists, in his own work he was just as catholic, allying Marxism with non-Marxist philosophy, it was a history of science to which, he claimed, ‘French philosophy owes its renaissance in the last thirty years’.",13
777,II BACHELARD AND THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE,13
778,"Against the Hegelian synthesis of all kinds of history within the same developmental schema, Bachelard argued that the history of science cannot be assimilated into the progressive evolutionary form commonly ascribed to other kinds of human history, and nor can it be mapped on a one-to-one basis against the history of its age.",13
779,"In certain pure sciences, mathematics , although discoveries may enable changes and developments of a material kind, their occurrence cannot be explained by being related to the allegedly determining political and economic history of their immediate era.",13
780,"As Levi-Strauss was to argue, different histories have different temporalities: the time scales of the sciences do not work at the same pace as other forms of history: they have their own dynamic, their own rhythm, their own times, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, that do not operate by the ordinary round of the year; Bachelard was fond of pointing out that from a scientific point of view the ten years from 1920 to 1930 were as long an era as the previous five hundred.",13
781,This unevenness of development means that there can be no general history of science as such: it is uneven but it cannot be combined.,13
782,Many sciences moreover share the characteristic that a major discovery means that all other models and theories are simply and have to be discarded.,13
783,"From the point of view of the present, the past has to be excised.",13
784,"Contemporary science is able to designate itself, through its revolutionary discoveries, as a .",13
785,Here discoveries are exhibited which send back all recent history to the level of a prehistory.,13
786,"Here we do indeed find an example of a ‘liquidation’ of history which, it will be recalled, is exactly the accusation that Terry Eagleton makes against poststructuralism; but the actual example in Bachelard demonstrates how much more complex the issue turns out to be.",13
787,"Science's negative relation to the past emerges as one of its most distinctive and significant aspects, one which marks a complete break with the cumulative structures of the arts and social sciences.",13
788,"It means, , that the temporality of science cannot be accommodated to the rhythms of traditional historiography, which has not, however, prevented positivistic historians of science from writing its history solely precursors and anachronistic anticipations of modern ideas in early thinkers, science unrolled smoothly and inevitably from year to year.",13
789,"The problem with this approach is that it overestimates the extent of narrative continuity in the history of science which, Bachelard's examples, works rather by sudden disruptions, discontinuities, and entire reorganizations of its principles.",13
790,Science is forever remaking its own history.,13
791,"As early as 1934 Bachelard had argued that the revolutionary changes in physics, relativity theory and microphysics, meant that science itself was currently defined by its reaction against the past, and had become a ‘philosophy of the non,— non-Cartesian, non-Euclidean, non-Newtonian, and non-Baconian.",13
792,"These major transformations cannot be mapped onto the model of a continuous history, for its stress on putative anticipations fails to account for the way in which the whole form of knowledge can be transformed and a new understanding created.",13
793,Bachelard's work on the formation of scientific disciplines led him to argue that the proper form of historical analysis should focus not upon an empirical history but upon the cognitive or epistemological status of concepts that distinguish a new science from an old one.,13
794,"Those concepts have not evolved from the old ones, for it is precisely their radical difference that constitutes the new science, the new ‘positivity’, produced by what he termed an ‘epistemological rupture’.",13
795,Bachelard himself preferred to give examples of such ruptures theorize how they took place.,13
796,"Althusserians subsequently placed much emphasis upon the ‘epistemological break’, and were in turn castigated for being unable to explain how it occurred.",13
797,"But this neglects the force of Althusser's emphasis on Marxism as itself a theoretical practice with its own history of epistemological self-correction, a possibility derived from the work of the mathematician Jean Cavaillès, who stressed the degree to which the history of mathematics, particularly set theory, could be accounted for by the dialectical development of the concept.",13
798,"Much of the emphasis on set theory in Lacan and others, the similarity of certain of their ideas to those of Gödel, whose work Cavaillès utilizes, can be attributed to his influence: indeed it would be possible to argue that the whole emphasis in post-war French thinkers on a non-contradictory heterogeneity in which incompatible or incommensurable elements are juxtaposed against or as part of is  derived as much from set theory as from Freud.",13
799,"Cavaillès developed these ideas into a theory of science as such, which, he argued, changed not through empirical discovery but through the theoretical reworking of its own concepts in the ‘pure’ sciences.",13
800,"This view, whereby science progresses through the dialectic of its concepts by testing its hypotheses against ‘experience’, was developed significantly by both Bachelard and Althusser.",13
801,"If it enabled the latter the crucial theoretical move of being able to reject the classical empiricist conception of knowledge, it was also to put him in the position of even castigating as ‘historicist’ any attempts to account for theoretical discourse its historical conditions of production — perhaps one of the major ways in which he differed from Canguilhem and Foucault.",13
802,Bachelard and Cavaillès agree that the distinguishing characteristic of modern science is the degree to which it has become separated from common-sense knowledge consciousness and its concepts are now opposed:,13
803,The break between ordinary and scientific knowledge seems to us so clear that these two types of knowledge could not have the same philosophy.,13
804,Empiricism is the philosophy which corresponds to ordinary knowledge.,13
805,"There empiricism finds its origin, its evidence, its development.",13
806,"By contrast, scientific knowledge is bound up with rationalism and, whether one wishes it or not, rationalism is allied to science, and demands scientific goals.",13
807,The use of scientific instruments means that scientific perception is constantly at odds with the experience of everyday perception.,13
808,"Because scientificity is achieved through a break with common-sense forms of thinking, termed ‘epistemological obstacles’, Bachelard, like Lévi-Strauss and Althusser after him, argues that any philosophy existentialism that is founded on the basis of the truth of the experience of the knowing subject is bound to involve illusory or ideological forms of thought.",13
809,"For this reason, Bachelard refers ironically to Sartre's phenomenology as a belated form of alchemy.",13
810,"But if the new science is produced through a rupture with the ‘errors’ of the old, the tenacious hold of common-sense forms of thought means that any given text may simultaneously embody aspects of the old and new ways of thinking, theoretical and ideological frameworks that Bachelard, and Althusser after him, term ‘problematics’:",13
811,"the parade of universal doubt, scientific research requires the establishment of a .",13
812,"It takes its real departure from a , it is badly set up.",13
813,"The scientific I is then a , whereas the non-scientific I is already a .",13
814,Bachelard tries to think through the problem of how epistemological obstacles operated both before and after scientificity.,13
815,", he suggests that the educational system has a marked effect on the production and reproduction of scientific knowledge, and criticizes it for the ahistorical way in which it teaches scientific problems, theories, experiments and proofs.",13
816,"While pedagogy continues the myth of an elementary or easy science, language itself can also produce difficulties.",13
817,The nomenclature of science does not refer to definitive concepts:,13
818,"It is ceaselessly adjusted, completed, varied.",13
819,The language of science is in a state of permanent semantic revolution.,13
820,Obstacles these lead Bachelard to formulate a theory of ‘material psychoanalysis’ which offers a ‘psychoanalysis of objective knowledge’to account for and think through the problem of epistemological obstacles.,13
821,"It is also supposed to have a therapeutic effect of a ‘brutal, surgical’ separation of unconscious and rational convictions ‘to cure us of our images or to limit their power’.",13
822,This separation between scientific and common-sense knowledge in turn produces a significant effect on Bachelard's thinking about history.,13
823,"For, as Lecourt describes it, he attempts",13
824,to elaborate a system of concepts which will make it possible to think the intrication of : that of the scientific and the non-scientific in the practice of the scientists.,13
825,Hence this project culminates in with the project of an epistemological history which is presented as a dual history; a ‘ratified history’(or history of the scientific in scientific practice) and a ‘lapsed history’(or history of the interventions of the non-scientific in scientific practice).,13
826,"This means that science can have two histories, which constantly intertwine but never resolve, with one evaluated as positive, the other as negative and therefore silently suppressed it may remain determining.",13
827,"upholding one at the expense of the other, Bachelard offers the possibility of a deconstructive history which would reinscribe that which had been excluded; this could also enable a differential history of science and ideology, accounting for the perpetuation of ideology after the production of science.",13
828,"To do so, Bachelard, as Althusser was to do later, invokes the use of psychoanalysis for the study of history and ideology.",13
829,"The notion of the epistemological break, while offering a theory of scientificity, and even of ideology, implied a very different view of history from that of Sartre.",13
830,"In some sense, it went to the other extreme, for from a totalizing history it projected a form of history in which there was no attempt to link different histories .",13
831,"Bachelard assumed the necessary division of the scientific from the non-scientific, he was continually encountering their imbrication and finding himself in the  position of trying to keep them apart.",13
832,"Lecourt has pointed to the absence of ‘a concept that would enable him to think together several histories with different statuses; , the concept of a history’.",13
833,Such a general concept was to be provided by Althusser's theory of relative autonomy within a structure in dominance.,13
834,III ALTHUSSER AND THE SCIENCE OF HISTORY,13
835,Althusser's rereading of Marx can thus be as usefully considered in the context of theories of the history of science structuralism; a certain conflation between the two has been possible because both were opposed to humanistic and phenomenological theories of knowledge and to historicism .,13
836,"Within the general framework of his attack on the humanistic Hegelian tradition of Western Marxism, Althusser's specific objection to Sartre's attempt to mediate Marxism with existential subjectivity was that such a move went against the crucial discoveries which had founded Marxism in the first place; in an extension of Lévi-Strauss' argument, he maintained that the notion of ‘man’ that Sartre used was derived from a particular ideological definition of the human subject which represses Marx's insight that the human subject is not the centre of history, together with Freud's that the subject is not centred in consciousness.",13
837,For Althusser both history and the subject are equally decentred: his attack on Sartre's claims for a unitary history (however complex its textual elaboration may have proved to be) was therefore accompanied by a critique of the notion of the unitary human subject that constitutes it.,13
838,One way of characterizing Althusser's intervention would be Martin Jay's observation that he effectively destroyed the Lukácsian notion of totality.,13
839,Another would be to say he attempted to theorize the very position that Sartre had fought to get .,13
840,"If Sartre's argument depended on a logic of history as totalization but broke down when he could not combine the praxis of the individual with the general logic of ‘totalization without a totalizer’ except through the proliferation of his own writing, Althusser, by contrast, exploited the possibility of history as a ‘process without a subject’, a history characterized by radical breaks and discontinuities, distinct from and not totalizing.",13
841,"It was this aspect of Althusserian theory, perhaps more than any other, that led many orthodox Marxists to consider that Althusser was not really a Marxist .",13
842,"The accusation that poststructuralism neglects history undoubtedly harks back above all to the work of Althusser who, more than anyone else, appears to have attempted to eliminate history.",13
843,"Notwithstanding their philosophical and political differences, there are nevertheless certain similarities between Althusser's and Sartre's projects when viewed orthodox Marxism.",13
844,"Althusser shared Sartre's opposition to Stalinism's emphasis on economism and technical  determinism, dissociating himself from it not through an assertion of individual agency but through a reformulation of the Marxist thesis of determination by economic relations — redefined as a causal a historical relation.",13
845,"At the same time Althusser argued that Sartre had not isolated the central problems of orthodox Marxist theory, and as a result continued to work with some of its more questionable preconceptions.",13
846,", in spite of his attempt to avoid positing history as an transcendent law, in the published first volume of the he had still utilized an organicist teleological model of history which assumes that the end is already implicit in the beginning, and that history rolls forward to a determined end.",13
847,"Both Stalinism and Sartreanism assume that history is an emancipatory process of self-realization, the forces of production in the one are replaced by the praxis of the self-conscious human subject in the other.",13
848,Althusser termed such a view ‘historicism’: an abstract philosophical scheme that imposes an overall process of transformation upon historical events.,13
849,"At first glance, it might seem Althusser himself gave up history and tried science instead.",13
850,"Like Sartre, he sought to constitute Marxism as a form of truth, but attempted to prove its truth not through the dialectic of history but rather as a science, authenticating Marx's ‘immense theoretical revolution’ epistemologically through a demonstration of its scientificity.",13
851,"to claim a scientific status for Marxism as knowledge ideology, or non-knowledge, Althusser invoked Bachelard's historical epistemology which allowed him to posit the idea of a radical discontinuity between the two, with Marxist science separated from earlier forms of non-knowledge in Marx's texts by an ‘epistemological break’.",13
852,This necessarily meant that Althusser endorsed Bachelard's arguments about empiricism and rejected the concept of history as a system of progression or evolution.,13
853,However Althusser found it difficult to maintain a Marxist theory of history while avoiding its customary Hegelian form.,13
854,"His basic argument, that Marx proposed a new conception of knowledge defined against Hegelianism, implied an accompanying revision of the Hegelian concept of history, which, as we have seen in the cases of Lukács and Sartre, had hitherto provided the dominant model of Marxist historicism.",13
855,"Althusser's theory of history has been more widely attacked and denigrated than any other aspect of his work, largely because he dared to argue that, far from providing the unassailable foundation of Marxism, history was a problematic concept even in Marx's own texts:",13
856,"this apparently full word is in fact theoretically an empty word, in the immediacy of its obviousness — or rather, it is the ideology-fulfilment which surfaces in this lapse of rigour.",13
857,"Anyone who reads without posing the critical question of its object sees no malice in this word that ‘speaks’ to him: he happily continues the discourse whose first word this word may be, the ideological discourse of history, and then the historicist  discourse.",13
858,"As we have seen and as we understand, the theoretical and practical consequences are not so innocent.",13
859,(143),13
860,Althusser argues that Marx's intervention did not merely amount to the historicization of the formal categories of the classical economists.,13
861,If this was the case all he would have done would have been to Hegelianize Ricardo.,13
862,"Marxists often imply that Marxism simply involves the introduction of a historical framework —‘always historicize!’— but this assumption can only be made, Althusser, ‘’:",13
863,"In reality, it is to introduce as a solution a concept which itself poses a theoretical problem, for as it is adopted and understood it is an uncriticized concept, a concept which, like all ‘obvious’ concepts, threatens to have for theoretical content no more than the function that the existing or dominant ideology defines for it.",13
864,"It is to introduce as a theoretical solution a concept whose status has not been examined, and which, far from being a solution, is in reality a theoretical problem.",13
865,(93),13
866,Historicism presumes that a concept of history can be borrowed for Marxism from Hegel or from the practice of empiricist historians without difficulty and without asking how such a concept is specific to Marxism: for Althusser the crucial question is to ask ‘what be the content of the concept of history imposed by Marx's theoretical problematic?’,13
867,"That problematic cannot be identical to Hegel's because both Hegel and Marx define historical time the social totality: their definitions of the social totality can be shown to differ, so also will their concepts of historical time.",13
868,For Flegel ‘historical time is merely the reflection in the continuity of time of the internal essence of the historical totality incarnating a moment of the development of the concept’(93).,13
869,Historical time is the existence of the essence of the social totality and will therefore indicate its structure.,13
870,"Althusser isolates two key characteristics of Hegelian historical time, ‘its homogeneous continuity and its contemporaneity’.",13
871,The first is well known: here time is the ‘continuum the dialectical continuity of the process of the development of the Idea is manifest’(94).,13
872,In this schema the science of history consists of the problem of the division of this continuum into the periods that constitute successive dialectical totalities.,13
873,"The second characteristic, the contemporaneity of historical time, , the category of the historical present, is more complex but an essential element in the whole Hegelian model of history, indeed is its condition of possibility.",13
874,"If historical time is the existence of the social totality then the relation between the two must be one of immediacy, allowing what Althusser calls an ‘essential section’, that is ‘a break in the present all the elements of the whole revealed by this section are in an immediate relationship with , a relationship that immediately expresses their internal essence’.",13
875,"This section is possible precisely because the unity of the whole is an expressive totality, that is ‘a totality all of whose parts are so many ‘’ each expressing the others, and each expressing the social totality that contains them, because each in itself contains in the immediate form of its expression the essence of the totality itself’(94).",13
876,"Hegel's conception of historical time, then, reflects his conception of the intrinsic unity between all parts of the social totality, each a part of the whole and the whole present in each part, history too partakes of a self-reflective immediacy which paradoxically makes it ahistorical.",13
877,"Perhaps surprisingly, given his alleged ‘structuralism’, Althusser argues that the structuralist distinction between synchrony and diachrony rests upon this Hegelian version of historical time which is both continuous and contemporaneous with itself.",13
878,"Against this Althusser maintains that time, even chronological time, is not just an empirical entity, but a concept; that though history may be articulated with chronological time, each history has its own temporality, which can only be found by establishing the conceptual nexus of the history in question.",13
879,"to determine what an event is, we must know the concept of the history in which the event is to occur.",13
880,", to understand the history of physics, we have to know the concept or problematic of physics to establish what an event in physics consists of.",13
881,"a chronological narrative can be constructed, but the history of physics in fact has its own temporality in which the first event after Aristotle was Newton, the second was Einstein, the third black holes, etc.",13
882,"Now this specific temporality will have no homogeneous relation to, say, the history of literature.",13
883,"However, it can be articulated with other histories, indeed is articulated, the overall but decentred totality of the particular mode of production.",13
884,"Sometimes Althusser seems to imply that different histories may range through different modes of production, at other times it appears that they are specific to each, an effect of the overdetermination of the social formation.",13
885,"But in either case, unlike the Hegelian essential section, where each event can be shown to be in an essential articulation with the whole in a continuous and homogeneous spatio-temporality, a cross-section at any particular moment will show a heterogeneous array of presences and absences.",13
886,"Althusser elaborates his thesis that Marxism is not a historicism at some length, presenting a critique of the historicist and humanist traditions which he takes back from Sartre to the beginning of the century, even to the Russian Revolution itself, and in which he also includes the ‘absolute historicism’ of Gramsci and the Frankfurt School.",13
887,"Above all, he criticizes the ways in which Hegel reduces the diverse historical totality of a society to a single internal principle, history occurs only through the principle of contradiction in the dialectic.",13
888,"For Althusser, the apparently simple contradiction is always overdetermined: the inversion of Hegel's single principle to a dialectic generating successive modes of production  amounts to economism.",13
889,"This objection holds equally for Sartre's Hegelian historicism, the effect of which is to reduce the multiplicity of different practices to a single practice, ‘’ history’(136).",13
890,Sartre's historicism shares the common tendency of all historicist interpretations of Marxism which transform ‘the Marxist totality into a variant of the Hegelian totality’: they all share the structure of the contemporaneity of a temporal presence and continuity which allows the possibility of an essential section.,13
891,"paradoxically therefore, Althusser argues, humanist Marxism shares the same basic theoretical principles with the orthodox economist Marxism of the Second International which politically it was its aim to oppose: for whether passive or active, fatalist or voluntarist, both reduce Marxist analysis to a single theoretical problematic.",13
892,All that has happened is that the relations of production have been turned into historicized human relations.,13
893,IV THE LONELY HOUR,13
894,"Althusser's procedure has been to show that, within a notion of history that seemed it could be invoked on its own as self-evident, there rests an entire presupposition about the conception of the social whole that is not derived from Marxist theory.",13
895,"The Marxist concept of historical time must instead, he argues, be thought through ‘on the basis of the Marxist conception of the social totality’(97).",13
896,"That Marxist conception is, , the Althusserian one: in Althusser's reading of Marx the unity of the whole is precisely not that of the Hegelian — and Sartrean — expressive totality; rather it is constituted through overdetermination, through:",13
897,"a certain type of , the unity of a containing what can be called levels or instances which are distinct and ‘relatively autonomous’, and coexist within this complex structural unity, articulated with specific determinations, fixed in the last instance by the level or instance of the economy.",13
898,(97),13
899,"The Hegelian model of the coexistence of presence which allows the possibility of the ‘essential section’ is incompatible with this description, but Althusser continues to assume nevertheless that there is a totality and that it has ‘the structure of an ’(98).",13
900,"This structure, made up of a succession of different levels or instances, is dominated by one form of production which forces the unity of any conjuncture, the non-economic structures determined ‘in the last instance’ by the economic (99).",13
901,This last description is often misunderstood: the point is that the economic is never a simple causal function that operates alone:,13
902,"the economic dialectic is never active ; in History, these instances, the superstructures, etc. — are never seen to step respectfully aside when their work is done or, when the Time comes, as his pure  phenomena, to scatter before His Majesty the Economy as he strides along the royal road of the Dialectic.",13
903,"From the first moment to the last, the lonely hour of the ‘last instance’ never comes.",13
904,The significance of the allusion to Freud in this famous passage is to suggest that to conceive of the economic as operating in isolation is as illusory as to imagine that the ego can operate without the unconscious: they are both the reciprocal products of the other.,13
905,"The ‘last instance’, the economic, never operates in isolation separate from all the other instances of the social totality: it is the lonely hour that never comes.",13
906,"If one were to pursue the analogy with Freud rigorously, Althusser is even suggesting here that the primacy of the economic (ego) is a delusion, and that the superstructure (unconscious) is the more fundamental determining force, or at the very least that they are equally overdetermined.",13
907,"Whereas Sartre's totality was never totalized because it was always still in process and could never be closed, Althusser's totality is never totalizable because it is decentred and displaced in time.",13
908,The different structured levels do not coexist in a temporal present which coincides with ‘the presence of the essence with its phenomena’.,13
909,This means that the model of continuous and homogeneous time which Lévi-Strauss had also argued against cannot here be regarded as the time of history.,13
910,This has nothing to do with turning diachrony into synchrony; the point is rather that,13
911,it is possible to think the process of the development of the different levels of the whole .,13
912,Each of these different ‘levels’ does not have the same type of historical existence.,13
913,"On the contrary, we have to assign to each level a , relatively autonomous and hence relatively independent, even in its dependence, of the ‘times’ of the other levels…",13
914,"Each of these peculiar histories is punctuated with peculiar rhythms and can only be known on condition that we have defined the of the specificity of its historical temporality and its punctuations (continuous development, revolutions, breaks, etc.).",13
915,(99–100),13
916,"These histories, their temporalities defined the specific concepts of particular domains, are not, however, independent of the whole: they are dependent on it, but in a structure derived from the ‘differential relations between the different levels within the whole…the mode and degree of of each time and history is therefore necessarily determined by the mode and degree of of each level within the set of articulations of the whole’(100).",13
917,"So if there are different histories, they must nevertheless be related to those other histories from which they differ but with which they, articulate in a structure of relative effectivity.",13
918,Such histories are constituted a Saussurian differential relation.,13
919,"Althusser therefore criticizes the historians for merely arguing that  periodizations differ for different times, and that each time has its own rhythms.",13
920,"This is not enough, for it is also necessary to ‘think these differences in rhythm and punctuation in their foundation, in their type of articulation, displacement and torsion which harmonizes these different times with ’— though it must be added that this begs the question of how such harmonization is achieved.",13
921,"For such times are not even necessarily the obvious ones, ‘the visible sequences of events recorded by the chronicler’, they may be invisible, ‘a complex ‘intersection’ of…different times, rhythms, turnovers, etc.’, only visible when their particular concepts are constructed and produced ‘the differential nature and differential articulation of their objects in the structure of the whole’(101–03).",13
922,"As an example of what he means, Althusser refers to Foucault's, remarkable studies',and , two instances in which the historian has had to construct the concept of their history.",13
923,This is antipodal to the empirically visible history in which the time of all histories is the simple time of continuity and in which the ‘content’ is the vacuity of events that occur in it which one later tries to determine with dividing procedures to ‘periodise’that continuity.,13
924,"these categories, continuity and discontinuity, which summarize the banal mystery of all history, we are dealing with infinitely more complex categories specific to each type of history, categories in which new logics come into play.",13
925,(103),13
926,This means that if one tries to take an ‘essential section’ there is no essence revealed which is the present of each level; indeed the break valid for one history would not necessarily correspond to that valid for any other which will live in a different time and in a different rhythm.,13
927,"The present of one level is, so to speak, the absence of another, and this co-existence of a ‘presence’ and absences is simply the effect of the structure of the whole in its articulated decentricity.",13
928,(104),13
929,"Any determinate mode of production, therefore, will evidence such a form of historical existence in its social formation: dislocated, uneven, absent and present.",13
930,"There is, Althusser stresses, no ‘single ideological base time, to which all these different temporalities can be related, no ordinary ‘single continuous reference time’ which they can be seen to dislocate (105).",13
931,"This differential account of history requires us to rethink a whole series of common notions unevenness of development, of survivals, backwardness, even, Althusser claims, the contemporary economic practice of under-development' — notions that provide the very basis of Western ethnocentrism.",13
932,"It also means that there can  no history , only specific structures of historicity.",13
933,Nor is history an evolving totality; each mode of production is made up  of differentiated histories.,13
934,"These differentiated histories form a specific historical totality, for each history operates within the general totality of the mode of production.",13
935,The economic therefore determines each history or level to the extent that its history is structured differentially against the totality which is defined as a specific mode of production.,13
936,"If for Hegel historical time is the reflection in time of the essence of the historical totality, for Althusser it is a function of the structure of the totality arising from a particular mode of production.",13
937,"No totality has a necessary transcendence embodied within it; the later Sartre, the course of historical change is open and will work only through the overdetermination of particular historical conjunctures.",13
938,"Althusser suggests that although Marxist history is defined as a theory of the modes of production, Marx did not give us any theory of how the transition was effected from one mode of production to another, nor of how each mode of production was constituted.",13
939,"Much of the effort of Althusserian Marxism was taken up with trying to produce such a theory, and it was the failure to produce it that perhaps was the main reason for its subsequent collapse.",13
940,"Althusser's influence declined in France after 1968, partly as a result of the role played by the PCF, of which Althusser was a member, in the events of May 1968, and partly as an effect of a number of critiques of his work, some of them by Althusser himself.",13
941,In Britain by contrast Althusser's greatest impact occurred in the decade that followed: from the late sixties his work constituted something like a hegemonic ‘theory in dominance’.,13
942,"After 1978, however, the influence of Althusser declined rapidly after a series of books by two Marxist sociologists, Barry Hindess and Paul Hirst, who developed and extended the implications of those critiques already made in France.",13
943,Their work made it impossible henceforth to invoke the work of Althusser in Britain without reference to the problems which they had articulated.,13
944,"With Hindess and Hirst criticism of Althusser's theory of history shifted to the problematic of the relation of the concept (increasingly assimilated to representation) to the real, thus reducing it to a question of epistemology.",13
945,"Where, though, does this leave the concept of history in Althusser?",13
946,"Does it have its own specificity the problems of the subject, representation, narrative and interpretation, with which many have now shown that it is necessarily involved?",13
947,"Does this mean, as Hirst suggests, that the only concept of history must in fact still be the Hegelian one?:",13
948,Teleology and spirituality are essential mechanisms of all philosophies of history.,13
949,"And, mindless antiquarianism or utter scepticism, there can be no history without a philosophy of history.",13
950,It is in the philosophy of history that the past becomes a possible and rational object of knowledge.,13
951,It is through the conception of historical time as a continuum that the past becomes a coherent object.,13
952,For Hirst this means that there can be no Marxist ‘science of history’ that can be opposed to the essentialism and teleology of a philosophy of history.,13
953,"Althusser's mistake, Hirst, was to attempt to construct another philosophy of history; but any theory of history, he contends, cannot do without teleology, spirituality (the realization of the Idea), and the continuum.",13
954,"On the other hand, we would add that the lesson of Hegel's, Marx's, and Sartre's attempt also suggests that history cannot be coherently essentialist and teleological either.",13
955,Hirst's straightforward characterization of Althusser's work as ‘a failure’ does not acknowledge the constant tension in the historical project itself.,13
956,"If Sartre's endeavour to ground the Marxist science of history suggests that the Hegelian totality and continuum can only work by a continual labour of excluding the partial and discontinuous, Althusser's effort to constitute a differentiated history shows that you cannot do it without a teleology.",13
957,"What both demonstrate is that any history as such has to think both, simultaneously.",13
958,"history is assumed to operate the protocols of a conventional logic, where a contradiction simply means you cannot think it or do it as Hirst supposes, then it remains at the impasse he describes.",13
959,Althusser's significant contribution was to problematize the concept of history by addressing its presuppositions about temporality — an area which Hindess and Hirst altogether neglect.,13
960,"to make their claim that his decentred totality is still expressive and therefore essentialist, they have to ignore the arguments about temporality in the critique of the Hegelian essential section as ‘the co-existence of presence’, and thus fail to do justice to the way in which Althusser constructs, as Foucault puts it, ‘a counter-memory — a transformation of history into a totally different form of time’.",13
961,"If the Althusserian mode of production is made up of differential times and histories, ‘a complex ‘intersection’ of the different times, rhythms, turnovers, etc.’, then each element cannot express the whole because the whole is only accessible as a concept, which is precisely not .",13
962,"For the concept, ‘like every concept, is never immediately ‘given’, never in visible reality: like every concept this concept must be — by the analyst.",13
963,"This formulation enabled Althusser to theorize a decentred totality which allowed the possibility of differences without reducing each instance to the operation of an essence or a single principle, the dialectic.",13
964,"If his notion of the mode of production as such a totality could not be sustained in a differential relation to other modes of production (notions of residual and emergent forms notwithstanding), Althusser nevertheless offered a particularly interesting theorization of the problems involved in the concept of the historical, articulating the paradoxical conditions of any theorization of history.",13
965,"If he showed it to be an impossible concept, he continued to demonstrate that it remains a necessary one, and acknowledged that we must learn to live with that impossibility.",13
966,How does this take place?,13
967,"It is at this point that the subject of history re-enters; history may be a process without one, but the subject is nevertheless inscribed within history.",13
968,", Sartre, the subject operates at the pivot of the paradox.",13
969,"For the subject does not understand history its scientific formulation, but undergoes the process of inter-pellation at the level of ideology, and thus experiences it through the formulas of historicism.",13
970,"History, which can now be considered a concept as such, is therefore made up of the incommensurable relation between these two disjunctive set-ups.",13
971,"It therefore operates for Althusser both at the level of science and of ideology, not truth to falsity, but as an irresolvable dialectic between the differential relations of the mode of production and the historicism of the ideological notion of history.",13
972,Hence his argument that ‘the knowledge of history is no more historical than the knowledge of sugar is sweet’.,13
973,"What then is the relation of science to ideology, of Althusserian history to its ideological historicist formulation?",13
974,"The gap between them, Althusser, is mediated by art.",13
975,This statement is often regarded as a curious relic of the values of bourgeois culture.,13
976,"But it is also possible to see it as an attempt to formulate the way in which the sliding incompatibility of the two can only be perceived through an ‘internal distantiation’ in which the problem of that ‘relation’is enacted by its , in the sense of the telling of a story — which is how we get history.",13
977,"If history is a process, Althusser remarks, ‘]’.",13
978,"History is a matter of relations, and thus of writing reports.",13
979,"Althusser thus suggests that history can only be thought through as a permanent contradiction: it is a totality, but that totality is a decentred structure in dominance in which each history's history is defined not through its identity with, or difference from, a general history but by being differentiated from every other history, on which it is necessarily also therefore dependent, in a kind of negative totalization.",13
980,"Within the realm of ideology, on the other hand, history is experienced by subjects as a purposive continuum, with themselves as its subject.",13
981,"Another way of putting this would be to say that Althusser demonstrated that the protocols of conventional logic, history is impossible.",13
982,"If you try to think of it as a closed totality you get into the problems of historicism; if you try to think of it as entirely differentiated, then it becomes meaningless since there is no necessary connection, positive or negative, to anything else, nor would any one history produce any effect on another.",13
983,Any differential theory of identity must think both totality and difference simultaneously.,13
984,"It is this structure which both Sartre's ‘singular universal, and Althusser's relative autonomy within a structure in dominance attempt to formulate, and in both cases the in-between of such simultaneity emerges as the process of writing itself.",13
985,"V ‘IF THERE IS HISTORY’: HISTORY, HERMENEUTICS AND HISTORICITY",13
986,With Sartre and Althusser we encounter the two poles of post-war French return-to-Marxism.,13
987,"Although both could be said to be reacting against the ossification of Stalinism, the subjectivist and ultra-objectivist paths that they followed were antithetical.",13
988,"This schematic characterization, however, does not do justice either to the manner in which they attempted to keep both poles in play , nor to the way in which they came to concede the impossibility of the theoretical projects which they undertook.",13
989,"To dismiss them as failures on this account, however, would be merely reductive.",13
990,Their real force can be discerned from the extent to which the problematics they set up have continued to exercise subsequent writers.,13
991,Since Sartre and Althusser has attempted a new theorization of a Marxist history.,13
992,"We are not, therefore, now looking at another paradigm, another system.",13
993,"attempting to repeat and surpass the exalted projects of Sartre or Althusser in a new guise, later writers Foucault or Derrida learnt a lesson from history, and stopped to ask why such comprehensive theories, like so many of those which preceded them, could not hold together.",13
994,For the grand narrative of History was always too big for its boots.,13
995,"Instead, therefore, of excluding history as has so often been claimed, such thinkers begin, in a rather more conventional way, from the anti-historicist perspectives of Althusser, even, arguably, of Sartre.",13
996,The generic label ‘poststructuralist’ is here useful merely as a shorthand to designate those contemporary writers who share not a hostility to history as such but a distrust of simple historicisms.,13
997,"Lyotard, , is best known for his scepticism towards historicist universal narratives, advocating instead the possibility of a multiplicity of heterogeneous, conflicting and incommensurable histories.",13
998,"Foucault works from exactly the same tradition in the philosophy and history of science as Althusser: like him he utilizes Bachelard's concept of differentiated histories, which still stands as the major alternative, epistemic or otherwise, to historicism.",13
999,"If such a theorization of history, as diacritical and singular, articulated breaks and ruptures, was new even with Althusser, it has been continued as a self-conscious derivation from him by Derrida.",13
1000,In Derrida comments:,13
1001,"Althusser's entire, and necessary, critique of the ‘Hegelian’ concept of history and of the notion of an expressive totality, etc., aims at showing that there is not one single history, a general history, but rather histories in their type, rhythm, mode of inscription — intervallic, differentiated histories.",13
1002,I have always subscribed to this.,13
1003,"the claims of certain American commentators, Derrida's uncharacteristically emphatic endorsement here of Althusser's project  the possibility of ‘intervallic, differentiated’ histories, suggests the problems involved in invoking Althusser as an ‘answer’to Derrida; both are equally distrustful of any form of Hegelian historicism.",13
1004,"This does not, however, mean that they then take up identical positions the problem of history.",13
1005,Derrida has not been concerned to formulate a new philosophy of history; nor has he attempted to specify new methodologies in the manner of Foucault.,13
1006,"Describing himself as ‘very wary of the concept of history’, Derrida has rather attempted to shift the problem the conceptual analysis of history as an ‘Idea’ which, perhaps more than anything else, has proved to be Hegel's most enduring legacy, towards an analysis of the interstices in the implications of the general system in which it operates.",13
1007,"In the first instance, therefore, he focuses not on history as such but on the related problem of hermeneutics and historical understanding: history here becomes a problem of meaning and interpretation —‘the age already in the is in fact constituted in every respect as a ’.",13
1008,"This also involves an inquiry into the ways in which the critique of the sign affects historical representation, and the dependence of history on the genetic metaphor and on narrative.",13
1009,"Important though these issues are, Derrida's major contribution has been his insistence that history is a metaphysical concept which the meaning of history always amounts to the history of meaning.",13
1010,As he himself puts it:,13
1011,"From the first texts I published, I have attempted to systematize a deconstructive critique precisely against the authority of meaning, as the or as , in other words, history determined in the last analysis as the history of meaning, history in its logocentric, metaphysical, idealist…representation.",13
1012,The Derridean critique of logocentrism necessarily includes the concept of history it depends on notions of presence and meaning determined as truth.,13
1013,"For all its frequent invocation as the ‘concrete’, history must by definition entail a problematic represencing of an absence; Derrida therefore argues that, even in its ‘materialist’ conceptualization, it cannot avoid a certain metaphysics.",13
1014,"As early as the 1966 essay ‘Structure, Sign, and Play’, , he maintains that his analysis of the paradoxical metaphysics of ‘the centre’ is equally applicable to the historical notions of ‘origin' and ‘end’.",13
1015,History consists of,13
1016,"a concept which has always been in complicity with a teleological and eschatological metaphysics, in other words, paradoxically, in complicity with that philosophy of presence to which it was believed history could be opposed.",13
1017,The thematic of historicity…has always been required by the determination of Being as presence…,13
1018,"History has always been  conceived as the movement of a resumption of history, as a detour between two presences.",13
1019,"Derrida's deconstruction of the notion of presence by the logics of the ‘always already’ and ‘originary repetition’inevitably conflict with a history constructed a teleological movement from an origin, which can always be reawakened, towards the self-realization of an idea ‘whose end may always be anticipated in the form of presence’.",13
1020,"The meaning of such a history will always be determined through appeal to a transcendental signified, whereas a deconstructive analysis will demonstrate the simultaneous effects of the lack of such an authority.",13
1021,"More radically still, Derrida works at the limits of any possible philosophy of history, arguing that it is not just that the problems of hermeneutics, specifically of interpretation and language, affect historical understanding, but that what in a broad sense he calls writing, or , determines history.",13
1022,"At the very opening of , , he sets out the thesis that writing constitutes the condition of emergence for all forms of historicity as such:",13
1023,Historicity itself is tied to the possibility of writing…,13
1024,Before being the object of a history — of a historical science — writing opens the field of history — of historical becoming.,13
1025,‘Language as the origin of history’: on what basis does Derrida make the startling and radical claim that writing as transcendence constitutes the condition of all historicity?,13
1026,"to try to elucidate this controversial argument, we can return to the well-known remark in the essay ‘Différance’:",13
1027,"if the word ‘history’ did not carry with it the theme of a final repression of  , we could say that differences alone could be ‘historical, through and through and from the start.",13
1028,"Here we revert to the dialectic of the same and the other: as Derrida puts it, ‘that the same…is never the identical, means first that Being is history’.",13
1029,"It is only through difference, by which the same becomes other and produces a tissue of differences, that history could ever take place: for if full presence were possible, then there would be no difference, and therefore no time, space — or history.",13
1030,means precisely that you can never get — and therefore have no need to get back to — history.,13
1031,"It also means that if difference in its sense of non-identity sets up the possibility of history, then difference in its sense of delay means also that it can never be finally concluded, for such deferral will always inhibit closure.",13
1032,"It is in this sense that Derrida argues that Husserl's sets up ‘the possibility of history as the possibility of language’ whereby ‘difference would be transcendental’: writing, in the general significance which Derrida gives it of a differential marking, must be the condition of any historicity.",13
1033,"‘History as then means that history will itself always be the operations of , and that names the form of its historicity.",13
1034,The same conditions hold for totalization.,13
1035,"Derrida argues that though history is given the form of a totality by Hegel, his shows that to achieve that totality it must constantly transcend itself in a movement of excess.",13
1036,History,13
1037,"is the history of the departures from totality, history as the very movement of transcendence, of the excess over the totality without which no totality would appear as such.",13
1038,"History is not the totality transcended by eschatology, metaphysics, or speech.",13
1039,It is transcendence itself.,13
1040,"History, in fact, works by exactly the same structure of supplementarity as Derrida charts in .",13
1041,"Here Rousseau himself demonstrates in his oscillating interpretations a history that cannot be linear, nor operate a single temporality, disturbing instead, the time of the line or the line of time’:",13
1042,We may perceive here the strange workings of the historical process Rousseau.,13
1043,"It never varies: beginning with an origin or a centre that divides itself and leaves itself, an historical circle is described, which is degenerative in direction but progressive and compensatory in effect.",13
1044,"On the circumference of that circle are new origins for new circles that accelerate the degeneration by annulling the compensatory effects of the preceding circle, and thereby also making its truth and beneficence appear.",13
1045,Such a history cannot be represented by the movement of a linear progression of unfolding time.,13
1046,"Its ‘transcendence’ marks the way in which it can similarly never be limited to a finite totality, nor, conversely, to an infinity:.",13
1047,it exceeds itself.,13
1048,"This process of supplementation, this ‘of the signifier’ that always goes beyond itself, is the result of a lack, or absence at the centre or origin, which must always be supplemented.",13
1049,"Thus the argument that ‘history’ is what ‘poststructuralism’lacks, itself repeats totalization's own structure of supplementarity which history functions both as an excess and a lack in the origin.",13
1050,"it sets up such a process of necessary and constant supplementation, we could say that the impossibility of totalization produces a writing-effect whose process of perpetual deferral unremittingly provokes more writing.",13
1051,"It is thus a question of being able to produce a new concept of history, which, as Derrida puts it, ‘.",13
1052,History cannot be done away with any more than metaphysics: but its conditions of impossibility are also necessarily its conditions of possibility.,13
1053,"This means, as Rodolphe Gasché observes, that ‘the mimicry of totality and of the pretension to systematicity is an inseparable element of deconstruction, one of the very conditions of  finding its foothold within the logic being deconstructed’.",13
1054,"Derrida himself, therefore, does not in any sense abjure history (or totality) but rather attempts to reinscribe it by writing histories that set up supplementary figures whose logic simultaneously invokes and works against historical totalities.",13
1055,"From this perspective, even Sartre's looks rather different from the way it appeared in the early sixties when read in the context of Lukács' .",13
1056,Today it seems to evince a growing recognition that totalization cannot be achieved without a movement involving the transcendence of itself.,13
1057,"In Sartre's terms, a totalization needs a totalizer.",13
1058,"It must always involve an excess beyond the totality without which the totality could never be totalized, which must mean that it can never in fact be closed.",13
1059,"Lyotard points to exactly the same structure in Marx, who could likewise never complete .",13
1060,"This endlessness of perpetual deferral, he argues, is later formalized in ‘a tragic political party…the negative dialectic of the ; it is the Frankfurt School, demythologized, Lutheran, nihilistic Marxism’.",13
1061,"But the perpetual threat of totalization, a spectre which the Frankfurt School anticipates endlessly, Derrida suggests rather that the problem in any structure is rather how it achieves closure.",13
1062,"this appears to have occurred, a deconstructive account will show how such a text had to dissimulate to cover over its own openings, or, to put it the other way round, it will show how history must always be organized by an attempted occlusion of its own conditions of historicity.",13
1063,"This means that it is not necessary to reject totalization as such — because such a rejection assumes its very possibility, whereas all attempts at totalization Sartre's demonstrate rather its impossibility.",13
1064,"Peter Dews has recently claimed that ‘post-structuralism can be understood as the point at which the ‘logic of disintegration’ penetrates into the thought which attempts to comprehend it, resulting in a dispersal into a plurality of inconsistent logics’.",13
1065,So poststructuralism is itself the ‘shattered mirror of the logic of disintegration.,13
1066,"But poststructuralism precisely does not try to disintegration, for grasping heterogeneity together is exactly what all totalizing theories have unsuccessfully attempted to do.",13
1067,"Having elaborated the paradoxical conditions of historicity, of any history or totalization, Derrida himself has been particularly concerned to analyse those Husserl, Heidegger or Levinas, who have been involved in investigations of time and temporality.",13
1068,"Although it would be possible to pursue the question of history such analyses of the forms of historicity, such an enquiry would take us on a very different path from that prompted by our original question, namely if poststructuralism can apparently be faulted by reference to a history which it neglects, where in Marxism can this history be found?",13
1069,"Since Sartre and Althusser there have been a number of possibilities: for some, the absolute historicism of the  Frankfurt School has become increasingly attractive, although in its current manifestation in the work of Habermas we might say that history has been eclipsed far more effectively than by any comparable French philosopher.",13
1070,"If Althusser gave us history without a subject, Habermas gives us subjects without history.",13
1071,Otherwise there have been two possibilities which effectively continue the lines of descent from Hegelian historicism and the history of science.,13
1072,"The most notable representative of the latter has been Michel Foucault, who has remorselessly continued the critique of totalizing forms of history and the disavowal of a general philosophy of history strategic ‘genealogical’ analyses.",13
1073,The alternative to this has amounted to a reaffirmation of historicism almost nothing had happened.,13
1074,"This has been the course of Perry Anderson, who after his Althusserian moment has returned to espouse the virtues of empirical historical studies, under the general aegis of a historicism anchored in the recasting of orthodox historical materialism by G.A.",13
1075,Cohen.,13
1076,More influential in the realm of literary and cultural theory has been another overt defence of historicism — that of Fredric Jameson.,13
1077,It is to Foucault and to Jameson that we now turn.,13
1078,Foucault's Phantasms,13
1079,It is in the work of Michel Foucault that we find the most unrelenting offensive against historicist theories of history.,13
1080,But Foucault can hardly be accused of neglecting history as such.,13
1081,"The demise of Althusserianism has meant that the extent to which subsequent writers, Foucault or even Derrida, continued to work within the problematic that his work had established, has tended to be overlooked.",13
1082,"It was Althusser who, after Sartre, problematized the very concept of history and laid the basis for much subsequent theoretical investigation.",13
1083,"In the post-Althusserian context of today it is nevertheless somewhat startling to find the Althusser of citing his debt to Foucault (Bachelard, Cavaillès, and Canguilhem) as one of our masters in reading learned works'. perhaps even more unexpected, the fact that a popular British Marxist position on Althusser is that he simply turned history into theory, is the choice of Foucault's (’ that work') and as examples of the kind of history, focused on the necessity of the production of a concept, that he was advocating.",13
1084,"In certain respects Foucault always remained close to the general positions from which Althusser worked, particularly the influence of Bachelard and his scepticism towards progressivist and homogeneous histories.",13
1085,"All were concerned to establish the possibility of discontinuity in a history, as Althusser described it, ‘steeped in the ideology of the philosophy of the Enlightenment, i.e. in a teleological and therefore idealist rationalism’.",13
1086,"But whereas Althusser followed Bachelard's and Cavaillès' preoccupation with the formal systems of the pure sciences and set theory, Foucault rather pursued Canguilhem's focus on the medical and biological sciences, which emphasized their cultural frame and the historical and institutional (both discursive and non-discursive) conditions of their emergence which, Canguilhem, ‘chronicle-history’ neglected.",13
1087,"From Bachelard and Canguilhem, Foucault derived his emphasis on the history of science as an epistemological study of the formation of concepts, a process of separation and discrimination which defines both the object and the problem that is  being made intelligible.",13
1088,"For Canguilhem the history of a concept will have its own specific temporality, demonstrating less a process of epistemological self-correction as in the pure sciences than the persistence of the problem within all the contradictory solutions and ideological values that have been given to it and which make up its history.",13
1089,This struggle is the inevitable result of disciplines which have no claim to the validation procedures of the pure sciences and involve non-discursive discursive practices and forms of knowledge.,13
1090,"Here the history of such sciences does not consist in the gradual unfolding and emergence of scientific truths, but rather of a history of ‘veridical discourses’.",13
1091,"Truth, like historicity, is derived from particular discursive practices; it operates internally as a form of regulation, being the historical product of the battle between different discursive regimes.",13
1092,Foucault's contribution was to adapt this type of analysis from the life-sciences to the human and social sciences.,13
1093,"Typically, his history takes the form of establishing a concept of something that chronological history would assume had no history, , madness, or sexuality.",13
1094,"the almost antithetical Marxist positions of Sartre and Althusser, Foucault does not, however, simply follow the latter the former: he articulates through a historical perspective the problems that their work encountered and attempts to produce a new method of historical enquiry — though not a general theory of history as such — that is both theoretically coherent and politically effective the particular problems under examination.",13
1095,That History and Marxism as such are casualties of this process is one obvious reason why attacks upon Foucault have been particularly virulent.,13
1096,"Foucault objects to historicism and Western humanism to the extent that they assume a continuous development, progress, and global totalization.",13
1097,"To this he adds his own more individual list of suspect conceptual categories: the subject, class, ideology, repression, the science/non-science distinction, any general theory of society, causality, or of history itself.",13
1098,It is interesting that despite this some writers are still prepared nevertheless to claim Foucault as a Marxist — perhaps less an indication of his Marxism than of his discursive power and the lack of alternatives within Marxism today.,13
1099,"Foucault emphasizes that his work does not lay claim to universal or general categories, nor is it even homogeneous, a presupposition that, as he has shown, has less to do with the work as such than the critical construction of its ‘author’.",13
1100,"Nevertheless we can say that his preoccupation with history has been consistent throughout: the articulation of repressed history in (1961), the historicity of history in (1966), the epistemic mutation of history and the theoretical difficulties of historiography in (1969), and the attempt to write a different kind of history, ‘genealogy’, that demonstrates the emergence of new forms of  power in (1975) and (1976–84)",13
1101,"Like many of those discussed in this book, Foucault endorses the ethico-political project of establishing forms of knowledge that do not simply turn the other into the same: as he put it in 1968, he wishes to find another politics than that which ‘since the beginning of the nineteenth century, stubbornly persists in seeing in the immense domain of practice only the epiphany of a triumphant reason, or in deciphering in it only the historico-transcendental destination of the West’.",13
1102,This focus on the link between the structures of knowledge and of power is increasingly related to an accompanying analysis of the discursive and technological mechanisms of repression and domination.,13
1103,"These ethico-political concerns formed the basis of his early works on madness: as he announced in his first book,(1954):",13
1104,"One day an attempt must be made to study madness as an overall structure — madness freed and disalienated, restored in some sense to its original language.",13
1105,"was such a study, but the assumption that it was possible simply to lift the repression and to let otherness speak for itself was questioned by Derrida in his well-known critique, ‘Cogito and the History of Madness’.",13
1106,"It is in this context that we can see the importance of the so-called Derrida-Foucault debate which is often misrepresented, not least by Foucault himself, as a confrontation between ‘textuality’ and ‘history’.",13
1107,"But Foucault's own subsequent work shows that it could not really be a question of choice on these terms, for the simple reason that, as he himself is at pains to point out in , history is itself a discursive practice: while the latter cannot be simply equated with the textual, it cannot be crudely opposed to it either.",13
1108,The dispute between Derrida and Foucault was less a question of text versus history than an argument about history itself.,13
1109,Derrida focuses on Foucault's claim that in he is writing a history of the Other.,13
1110,"His critique centres on two related problems: in the first place if, as Foucault argues, the expulsion of madness by reason constitutes the possibility of history as such, this gesture of exclusion produces the fundamental structure of historicity, then the ‘classical’ moment of this proscription that he describes must be an example an originary moment.",13
1111,"In the second place, if reason is defined by its elimination of madness, and if history is a rational concept, the question then follows, how can you write a history of madness?",13
1112,"Derrida comments: ‘It is the meaning of ‘’ history’or that should have been questioned first, perhaps'.",13
1113,Implicitly he is criticizing Foucault's understanding of the relation of the same to the other which posits madness as outside the sphere of reason.,13
1114,"To regard the latter as systematically oppressing madness and  forcing it to the margins — to literature, or the hospital — is simply to repeat, in reverse, the very structure that is being criticized.",13
1115,"Derrida contends that if madness is constituted as madness, as other, by reason, then this means that reason is itself defined through it and therefore already contains and depends upon it.",13
1116,Madness cannot be considered to exist outside the historical conditions of its production — and could never therefore be ‘restored…to its original language’ as Foucault hopes.,13
1117,"The problem for Foucault is that this argument involves more than just madness as such, for it really amounts to a questioning of the very possibility of critique.",13
1118,"In his early work we can see that Foucault's position involves a remarkable development of Althusser's hints that art can function as a privileged category that provides an ‘internal distance’ from ideology by relating histories, writing reports.",13
1119,"Something of the same special place of ‘retreat’ for art, especially literature and painting, is to be found in Foucault.",13
1120,"David Carroll has recently emphasized the significance of, a transgressive aesthetics or poetics of self-reflexivity' in his work.",13
1121,"Such self-reflexivity, far from involving a turning inwards as is so often generally supposed, comprises rather an edge or void from which a critical perspective can be opened up: a ‘thinking of the outside’.",13
1122,"So madness, or certain radical forms of writing, that of Sade, Bataille, Blanchot or Roussel, by transgressing the limits of order and turning back to reflect upon it, enable a space from which a critique can be made.",13
1123,"This self-reflexivity operates at the limit of reason or history, eluding even the structure of the .",13
1124,"In this schema, Foucault is therefore proposing a fundamental, enabling separation between writing and history.",13
1125,"But after Derrida's essay, Foucault abandoned his claims that certain forms of literature could effect such a critical, reflective detachment.",13
1126,This led to two problems: is there then any space from which a critique can be established? and how does Foucault reformulate the relation of writing to history?,13
1127,"In his subsequent work, the connection between the two would remain profoundly equivocal.",13
1128,The seriousness of Derrida's intervention can be discerned from Foucault's subsequent repudiation of the central thesis of and the change of direction that his work took thereafter.,13
1129,This is apparent from his rethinking of the ‘age-old distinction between the Same and the Other’.,13
1130,"While he retained his criticisms of rationality, Foucault substituted the idea of an otherness at work within reason for that of a repressed alterity existing outside or beyond it.",13
1131,"If madness or the other is always inside, then this means that it is always already a part of reason or the same; but it will also be exactly the element that reason is unable to comprehend, and will therefore work disruptively.",13
1132,This reformulation shows why it was necessary for Foucault to free himself from what he later termed ‘the repressive hypothesis’ of liberation.,13
1133,"It also provides the context in which to consider both the claim that for the later Foucault knowledge is absolutely determined, leaving him in the impossible situation of requiring something  outside this for any prospect of critique, the question of exactly how power and resistance are interdependent and to what extent they are separable.",13
1134,Any answer to these problems must take Foucault's own resituating of the dialectic of the same and the other into account.,13
1135,", it is not obvious how he relocates writing the history to which it had until then been opposed.",13
1136,"If it had previously operated critically outside history's limits, offering the only available possibility of critical distance, how might writing work transgressively within it?",13
1137,II DIFFERENTIATED HISTORIES,13
1138,"In , published three years after Derrida's critique, Foucault re-examines the links between Enlightenment rationality and history and poses the questions about the latter which Derrida had suggested that Foucault's work invites.",13
1139,In the Preface he resituated his earlier formulations as follows:,13
1140,"The history of madness would be the history of the Other — of that which, for a given culture, is interior and foreign, therefore to be excluded (to exorcise the interior danger) but by being shut away (to reduce its otherness); whereas the history of the order imposed on things would be the history of the Same — of that which, for a given culture, is both dispersed and related, therefore to be distinguished by kinds and to be collected together into identities.",13
1141,(xxiv),13
1142,Foucault thus modifies his argument that reason simply excluded madness and initiated the possibility of history by suggesting instead that the histories of the Other and of the Same are necessarily implicated within .,13
1143,"But at the same time he refuses Derrida's equation of historicity with difference as such, instead reformulating his former thesis now history itself takes part in the epistemic shifts that he traces.",13
1144,Initially Foucault argues that the stasis of what he calls the ‘Classical Order’ gave way to ‘History’— which took over both as the form of knowledge and as the fundamental mode of being for empirical phenomena.,13
1145,"By the end of , however, he revises this somewhat conventional thesis to suggest that what was involved was not so much a move from a static to a historical view of things as the break-up of a common, unified historical time-scheme in which every phenomenon had had its place in the same space and chronology.",13
1146,"a unity of time came the notion of discrete temporalities, with a recognition of a historicity proper to each discipline or area of knowledge.",13
1147,"a great historical narrative common to ill, everything now had its own chronology and its own history.",13
1148,The effect of this was to dehistoricize man himself.,13
1149,"Whereas formerly he had been the subject of history, taking pride of place in God's historical scheme from creation onwards, now ‘the human being has any history: or rather, since he speaks, works, and lives, he finds himself interwoven in his own being with histories that are neither subordinate to him nor homogeneous with him’(368 — 9).",13
1150,Man was the measure of all things.,13
1151,"Two possibilities were developed to deal with man's new homelessness in the world, his exposure, as Foucault puts it, to the finitude of the event, which attempted to draw all these heterogeneous histories together again: either men sought for some fundamental law through which a new general history could be constituted, or historicity as such was defined ‘man’— whether as progress, economic laws, or cultural totalities.",13
1152,"The creation of man as centre was effected by defining him against other, now marginalized groups, women, the mad, or, we would add, the allegedly sub-human ‘native’.",13
1153,"This move formed the basis for the human sciences which, through their organization around the figure of man, brought about a unity to History.",13
1154,"We shall examine the relation of this new humanism to the history of Western colonialism in a later chapter: it is not a question that Foucault himself elaborates in the course of what is claimed to be an, ethnology of Western culture'.",13
1155,"Rather he points to the theoretical paradox involved, namely that the human sciences' very emphasis on historicity as a mode of being was equally applicable to themselves as forms of knowledge, and inevitably destroyed any attempt to formulate universal laws comparable to those of the natural sciences.",13
1156,"Here we can see a rather different perspective on the human alienation which Lukács describes; in Foucault's account, Marxism's attempt to reproduce the totality in itself falls within the terms of his argument by which totalizing theories of history are based on an anxiety derived from the break-up of its unity.",13
1157,Marxism's claim to the status of a science proper thus functions as a device to avoid the historicity through which it accounts for other  .,13
1158,"by contrast points to the emergence of historicity as a mode of understanding, and argues that ‘History’, both as a form of knowledge and as the primary state of being of empirical phenomena — broadly speaking, the assumption of all Marxisms —.",13
1159,"This means that history cannot provide an unquestionable ground for knowledge, and that historicity cannot claim an privilege as the fundamental mode of being either.",13
1160,"As the two ‘counter-sciences’ ethnology and psychoanalysis have suggested, history is simply one possible discursive form of understanding — its problematic of temporality spills over into many others.",13
1161,"In making this argument, however, Foucault is not concerned to dispense with history — rather to make history itself an object of historical investigation and to question its presuppositions.",13
1162,", he challenges Hegel's equation in the of the evolution of history with the developing consciousness of man himself.",13
1163,"Although this has been particularly influential for many forms of Western Marxism, it also represents a deviation from Marx's original claim that history is the effect of material  conditions of human consciousness.",13
1164,"In this way Foucault could be said to be returning to Marx in removing the subject from the centre of history, were it not for the fact that he dispenses with the consolations of Marx's historicism also.",13
1165,"In this situation he asks, how do we come to terms with the event, with continuities and discontinuities, with history as difference and not just the story of sameness?",13
1166,"Foucault adopts a strategy, obviously indebted to Bachelard, designed to restore the otherness that History by definition must disallow: he produces an account of epistemic shifts, with prior presented as altogether estranged from the present.",13
1167,"to come to terms with the past, the initial gesture must be to confront its strangeness, to seek for similarities and continuities it can be equated with the present and thus, in effect, dehistoricized.",13
1168,"Following Althusser's suggestion that a historical problematic might be altogether invisible even to experiencing subjects, in Foucault analyses what he provocatively calls ‘the historical ’ which the knowledges of grammar, natural history and wealth, and their epistemic replacements, philology, biology, and political economy, were structured.",13
1169,"But as with Althusser's modes of production, so Foucault's attempt to elaborate a ‘’ of knowledge was criticized by Sartre, and subsequently by many others, for being unable to give any account of change and for implying a total discontinuity between periods.",13
1170,The objection that Foucault neglects history because he does not attempt to give reasons why the epistemic shifts he describes occurred is perhaps inevitable but also begs the question: for conventional historiography has done nothing but account for such shifts — which has meant that it has consistently failed to recognize alterity and incommensurability in its insistent search for continuities with the past.,13
1171,"Without history as a form of mediation the differences return as the problem, and it was this which, Foucault,was really trying to address.",13
1172,"Here we might recall Derrida's criticism of Levinas's history ‘as a blinding to the other, and as the laborious procession of the same’.",13
1173,"In the face of a history which obscures such discontinuities, the first stage for Foucault, therefore, is to defamiliarize it by reconstituting it without the mythology of a continuous History which has turned difference into identity.",13
1174,"It is often assumed that Foucault is simply the philosopher of discontinuity, merely substituting it where previously there had been continuity; but the discontinuous is emphasized only because so much stress is normally placed on the continuous.",13
1175,It is not just a question of exchanging one for the other.,13
1176,"This has a methodological implication : all too often it is assumed that Foucault's stress on disruption can be taken as equivalent to randomness, as we have seen with Perry Anderson.",13
1177,"However, it is more helpful to consider it in the context of Canguilhem, who emphasized that the life sciences, like the natural sciences, require their own specific mode of history; they show that historical method itself must be  heterogeneous, in the sense that there is no single method applicable to the whole range of different histories.",13
1178,Even the history of discontinuities is itself impermanent and discontinuous.,13
1179,"If certain forms of history stress continuity, try to account for change, the history of science by contrast must be disjointed, for it is made up of a series of corrections in which the errors of the past have to be simply discarded.",13
1180,"Foucault, as we have seen, is also criticized on the grounds that he cannot give a cause for the shifts he describes, but this criticism itself begs the question it assumes a certain kind of history, which itself presupposes that there was a cause in the sense of a single uniform causality, a disconnectedness in the scientific mode.",13
1181,"In the context of conventional historiography, Foucault argues that the point is to analyse the different kinds of transformation, the complex ‘play of dependencies’, links and redistributions, to provide yet another account of change, succession and its causes.",13
1182,", although in many ways Foucault's most influential work, remains, however, an oddity in certain respects: first, that in arguing for an common to a (limited) number of knowledges, Foucault at times seems to be advocating a structural key between different levels within the , thus restoring the form of the essential section so criticized by Althusser.",13
1183,"Foucault has even been accused of returning, in this work, to the concept of a totality in the ; it has certainly been somewhat hastily assumed that the latter can be appropriated more or less as a new way of describing a historical ‘period’.",13
1184,"This fails to recognize, however, the extent to which it articulates only the structure of certain specific forms of knowledge some single overarching principle.",13
1185,The constant emphasis on its being the suggests immediate problems for any assumption that it constitutes a totality.,13
1186,"The rather delineates what Foucault calls a ‘cluster of transformations’; these, he suggests, enable the substitution of ‘differentiated analyses for the themes of a totalising history:",13
1187,"They allow us to describe, as the of a period, not the sum of its knowledge, nor the general style of its research, but the deviation, distances, the oppositions, the differences, the relations of its multiple scientific discourses: the is not , it is a space of , it is an .",13
1188,"They allow us furthermore to describe not the great history which would carry along all the sciences in a single trajectory, but the types of history — , of retentivity and transformation — which characterize different discourses…common to all the sciences: it is .",13
1189,finally they allow us to situate the different thresholds in their respective place: for nothing proves in advance…that their chronology is the same for all types of discourse…,13
1190,"general stage of reason, it is a complex relationship of successive displacements.",13
1191,This is very different from the integral paradigms of Thomas Kuhn to which Foucault's are sometimes compared.,13
1192,"But if is thus concerned to analyse ‘ensembles of discourses’ that do not form a totality, it does not focus on the ways in which such forms of knowledges relate to the institutions in which and through which they are produced.",13
1193,"In Foucault corrects this by addressing the difficulties of making knowledges intelligible as a part of their institutional, social and political practices.",13
1194,III ARCHAEOLOGY,13
1195,"Foucault's distrust of conventional forms of history, as we have seen, is a consistent thread in his project, as is his insistence that his historical method is limited to addressing specific problems — often comparable to those posed by the social sciences — to historical documents and practices to make them intelligible.",13
1196,"Only once, however, does he devote a whole book to the problem of historical methodology.",13
1197,In he develops his suggestion in that an epistemological mutation is taking place today the very concept and methodology of history.,13
1198,"The book is both an account of and an intervention in that process, veering between the descriptive and the prescriptive.",13
1199,"It begins by delineating the epistemological shift: the old order could be termed ‘History’, a continuous and chronological historiography, including Hegelianism and related forms of Marxism, with its philosophies of history, its assumptions of a rational, progressive and teleological historical development, its desire to discover a meaning in history, its questioning of the relativity of historical knowledge, and its use of categories tradition, the history of ideas, the , the author and the book.",13
1200,Against this Foucault contrasts the work of the school which analyses long continuities in certain social forms:,13
1201,The old questions of the traditional analysis (What link should be made between disparate events?,13
1202,Flow can a causal succession be established between them?,13
1203,What continuity or overall significance do they possess?,13
1204,"Is it possible to define a totality, or must one be content with reconstituting connections?) are now being replaced by questions of another type: which strata should be isolated from others?",13
1205,What types of series should be established?,13
1206,What criteria of periodisation should be adopted for each of them?,13
1207,"What system of relations (hierarchy, dominance, stratification, univocal determination, circular causality) may be established between them?",13
1208,What series of series may be established?,13
1209,And in what large-scale chronological table may distinct series of events be determined?,13
1210,(3 — 4),13
1211,"Foucault notes that, at the same time as the school and others were constructing a history the long , in the history of science, philosophy, and literature, attention was turning in exactly the opposite direction, that is vast unities towards phenomena of rupture, discontinuity, displacement and transformation, towards different temporalities architectonic unities.",13
1212,"Here he instances the work of Bachelard, Canguilhem, Serres, Guéroult, and Althusser.",13
1213,"He argues that, given the proliferation of both discontinuities and long periods, the problem is now to constitute the series, its elements, its limits, and its relation to other series.",13
1214,"In other words, set these antithetical approaches against as one might have expected, Foucault suggests that they are part of the same mutation.",13
1215,"Foucault characterizes this epistemic shift the difference between what he calls ‘total’ and ‘general’history, or, History and archaeology.",13
1216,He explains this as follows.,13
1217,"Total, or, elsewhere, global, history assumes a spatio-temporal continuity between all phenomena, and a certain homogeneity between them they all express the same form of historicity — Althusser's essential section — whereas history the problem is precisely to determine the relation between different series: whereas a total history draws everything together a single principle, a general history analyses the space of dispersion and heterogeneous temporalities.",13
1218,"Total history seeks to reconstitute the overall form of a society some fundamental principle, law, or form, be it metaphysical or material, while general history despite its name is concerned to produce a general theory of history, nor even a cohesive or comprehensive view, but rather to conduct a historical investigation particular problems, opening up a field ‘in which one could describe the singularity of practices, the play of their relations’.",13
1219,"Foucault specifies the difference between them by contrasting their relation to the document: the historians of total history have been engaged above all in the interpretation of documents, attempting to reconstitute the past, to give it an inner meaning (always available only to the historian), to recover a voice and allow it to speak.",13
1220,"The historians of a general history, on the other hand, reject interpretation as such making the evidence of documents intelligible by posing questions to them, constituting through such questions what counts as the series of historical events, its elements, its limits, and its relation to other series, or what rules operated for particular discursive practices.",13
1221,This stress on intelligibility is a useful corrective to the widespread current assumption — for which Foucault himself is also partly responsible — that history is just another form of interpretation.,13
1222,"Unexpectedly, perhaps, Foucault traces the beginnings of this epistemic mutation in the thinking of history to Marx.",13
1223,This implies a challenge that contemporary Marxism has yet to address.,13
1224,"As we have seen, for some  Foucault can apparently be dismissed with ease as merely the philosopher of discontinuity, a description which is hardly adequate; for others, criticism takes the form that he simply relativizes history, but this is really no better, for history is itself a mode of demonstrating the relativity, temporariness, and temporality of phenomena.",13
1225,"Unless it is possible to prove the identification of History with Truth, as Sartre tried to do, then the claim that a single univocal History is not relative only works by removing all other elements in the set to which it could be compared, thus making a set of one.",13
1226,"Effectively, however, all this does is to turn all history into a single event — which, paradoxically, dehistoricizes it.",13
1227,What has not been adequately considered is Foucault's characterization of an epistemological shift within the theorization of history itself.,13
1228,"He suggests not only that it begins with Marx but that he himself forms part of this mutation, which means that, his argument, to dismiss him you would have to dismiss Marx also.",13
1229,"Foucault thus does not merely set up an alternative history, but contends that that alternative is part of a displacement that is in the process of replacing the history that preceded it.",13
1230,It is therefore necessary to address not only his theoretical and methodological but also his historical arguments — something that his critics have singularly failed to do.,13
1231,thus analyses the shift in historiography of which Foucault himself is the most powerful contemporary representative.,13
1232,"As epistemic breaks go, however, it seems to be a slow one: Foucault attributes its hesitancy to a fundamental reluctance to think difference the reassuring form of the identical: it is, he comments, ‘we were afraid to conceive of the in the time of our own thought’.",13
1233,"Here we encounter the continuing dominance of the philosophy of the subject, which, Foucault, was specifically introduced to provide a ‘shelter for the sovereignty of consciousness’ against the intrusion of heterogeneity.",13
1234,Continuous history and the subject are thus dependent on .,13
1235,"centring his analyses on the knowledge derived from the experience of the subject, Foucault investigates the conditions of emergence of the subject as the basis of knowledge; he argues that at the same time as it was widely proposed as the one saving good of human civilization it also facilitated a more sinister operation.",13
1236,"Just as History involved the legitimation as knowledge of certain forms of political power, so the production of the subject by the human sciences as an object of knowledge also enabled a new form of political control: ‘The individual is not a pre-given entity which is seized on by the exercise of power.",13
1237,"The individual, with his identity and characteristics, is the product of a relation of power exercised over bodies’.",13
1238,"In Foucault demonstrates how the individual is constituted through specific technologies of power; in the , he shows the extent to which the human sciences, including medicine and the practice of psychoanalysis, facilitated the extension of control beyond the limits of the body in the construction of the inner realms of subjectivity, consciousness and experience.",13
1239,"Foucault argues that a whole series of movements since the nineteenth century, including various anthropologizing Marxisms, have developed complicitly with this to preserve the sovereignty of the subject against Marx's and others' decentrings: positivism, the Hegelian Marxism of Lukács, the Marxist humanism of Sartre, various theories of cultural totalities that of the Frankfurt School.",13
1240,Dispensing with the subject necessarily also means the end of the use of the category of ideology; in this context Foucault's later work counters Althusser's influential essay on ideological state apparatuses.,13
1241,"Many of those now hostile to Althusser continue to endorse this essay, which offers a theory of institutional power dependent on the categories of the subject and ideology.",13
1242,"Foucault is critical of such a theory not just because it is based on a science/non-science distinction which for him is simply the product of a particular discursive formation which claims access to the real, involving any epistemological questions of truth or objectivity, but also because it produces the notion of ideology as a secondary mediation (as in Althusser's interpellation) in an inside/outside structure between the determinants of power and the individual subject.",13
1243,"For Foucault, the tendency of theories of ideology to entrammel themselves in the categories of psychoanalysis, even with the eternal in Althusser's case, means that they themselves begin to utilize the very procedures of individuation that they ought to have been analysing.",13
1244,The questions of the subject and of ideology raise as their corollary the problem of what position of enunciation the historian can claim his or her own work.,13
1245,"Foucault is particularly critical of the appropriating structure of totalization, Marxist or otherwise, it implies the superiority of the theorist who produces the totalization of knowledge; in the same way, he distrusts the use of history as an encompassing framework because it works as a power structure that enables the expropriation and control of the past the perspective and truth of the present.",13
1246,"It elides the fact that the historian will always also be historically located and therefore cannot be in a position to produce a final totalization, a dialectical situation anticipated by Sartre.",13
1247,"Foucault argues that just as there can be no general theory of history, but only particular answers to particular questions which make individual practices intelligible, so the intellectual can best hope to be specific universal (universal in the sense of proposing transcendent values, systems, totalities, narratives or teleologies).",13
1248,"This does not mean that the intellectual therefore nihilistically celebrates dispersion, fragmentation or relativity: rather she or he is the person who, facing such dispersion but without conceding to the nostalgic desire for totalization, poses the questions and constitutes the series and continuities for analysis — and thus for transformation — while attempting to respect its heterogeneity.",13
1249,"This suggests why, the way in which certain commentators tend to represent them, it is clear that for Foucault, Lyotard or Derrida, total fragmentation would be as counter-productive — and as impossible — as total synthesis.",13
1250,As Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak puts it: ‘Theoretical descriptions cannot produce universals.,13
1251,"They can only ever produce provisional generalizations, even as the theorist realizes the crucial importance of their persistent production’.",13
1252,"Such arguments will have no pretensions, by definition, to knowledge-claims that affect to rise above the historical conditions in which they are made.",13
1253,IV HISTORY AND THE EVENT,13
1254,"Despite his programmatic emphasis in the on the discursive formation as a means of making intelligible those knowledges that are formulated through their institutional components, Foucault turned this kind of historical enquiry because it was too ‘clean, conceptually aseptic’— in other words, too apolitical.",13
1255,"Foucault therefore abandons analysis of for the more Nietzschean ‘genealogy’, which allows him to articulate conflict differentiated histories with their own conceptual specificities and their own times, while retaining the possibility of the formulation of aims and intentions:",13
1256,"I would call genealogy…a form of history which can account for the constitution of knowledges, discourses, domains of objects etc., without having to make reference to a subject which is either transcendental the field of events or runs in its empty sameness throughout the course of history.",13
1257,"Genealogy develops the possibility broached in the that in a general history different significances can be accorded to events, ‘their correlation with other previous or simultaneous events, discursive or not’.",13
1258,Here it is the problem the historian poses that determines what constitutes an event and what status it has.,13
1259,"Foucault's genealogy means that by asking a question, posing a problem, you set up a generality against which you constitute events and arrange them in a series.",13
1260,"The construction of that generality does not pretend to be the only possible one — the same event could operate in all sorts of different ways in different series, temporalities, which would mean that, strictly speaking, it was the same event, for it would have been dispersed in their different rarefactions.",13
1261,"This is not supposed to suggest that events cannot be said to occur straightforwardly in the real but rather that when set up in any series, narrative, or history they are constructed as such events retrospectively by the historian.",13
1262,"If all history attempts to conceptualize the event, to wean it from its finitude, then Foucault like many of his contemporaries is concerned to  respect its singularity.",13
1263,"In the essay ‘Theatum philosophicum’(1970), written shortly after the , Foucault attempts to avoid the snares of the problem of the relation of the event to the totality, or the particular to the general, that beset both Sartre and Althusser, by arguing that the event as event is only constituted through its repetition in thought as a ‘phantasm’: ‘it makes the event indefinite it repeats itself as a singular universal’.",13
1264,"This argument, which Foucault derives from Deleuze, although at the same time he tellingly invokes Sartre's theoretical formulation designed to solve exactly the same problem, provides a way of avoiding the incommensurability of the relation of the event to the concept by allowing ‘the disjunctive affirmation of both’— thus solving the problem that the concept, as a part of the language of generality, will inevitably travesty the event's singularity:",13
1265,"causes us to reflect on matters that philosophy has neglected for many centuries: the event (assimilated in a concept, from which we vainly attempted to extract it in the form of a , verifying a proposition, of , a modality of the subject, of , the empirical content of history); and the phantasm (reduced in the name of reality and situated at the extremity, the pathological pole, of a normative sequence: perception-image-memory-illusion).",13
1266,"After all, what most urgently needs thought in this century, if not the event and the phantasm?",13
1267,"Well, it might be hard to see it as that important.",13
1268,"Foucault's gesture, however, marks the radical scope of such an anti-essentialist project which exploits Plato's admission that there can not only be a good copy but also a bad one — characteristic of the secondary representations of the poets.",13
1269,"Deleuze reverses Plato by validating this simulacrum of the good copy on the grounds that, precisely because it is a bad copy, it breaks down all adequation between copy and model, appearance and essence, event and Idea.",13
1270,"As plato realized, it is dangerous because its effect is to dethrone the Idea from its position of Truth.",13
1271,"Moreover, because the bad copy by definition cannot claim to be copying anything but itself, it creates its ‘original’ retroactively, the copy precedes the original in a ghostly originary repetition.",13
1272,"Descombes describes a comparable paradoxical structure in his account of ‘originary delay’: a first event cannot be the first event if it is the only event; it cannot be said to be a first until it is followed by a second, which then retrospectively constitutes it as the first — which means that its firstness hovers over it as its meaning without being identifiable with it as such.",13
1273,"Thus, the phantasm, the event, hovers over its surface like a cloud, as an effect of meaning not identifiable with anything in the event as such.",13
1274,"Deleuze's best-known example of how this works is the battle: ‘Where’’, he asks, ‘is the battle?",13
1275,"What we call a battle consists of a vast, heterogeneous array of individual actions in the field — fighting, firing, charging, wounding — none of which constitutes ‘the battle’ as such.",13
1276,"‘The battle’ hovers over the individual actions like in incorporeal cloud, distinct from them, but at the same time making up a surface of their meaning-effect, a simulacrum that brings the event into being at the moment when language and event coincide.",13
1277,"Foucault recognizes in Deleuze's account of events as singularities, points or intensities on a surface ready to be actualized in any particular form or meaning, the potential for pushing further his own notion of history as a genealogical series.",13
1278,"Such genealogy works by repeating the (non) event, as an event, in thought — in a structure comparable to Freud's ‘deferred action, or ‘retroactivity’.",13
1279,"No more than the latter does it seek to lay claim to ‘the real, or Truth as such.",13
1280,Foucault inflects this model by focusing on the possibility of constructing the series to repeat the disruption and discontinuity of the (non-original) event.,13
1281,"In freud, the point is similarly not just the question — on which most attention gets focused — of whether the event ‘really’ happened (a good copy) or was subsequently fantasized by the experiencing subject (a bad copy), but rather that it is repeated as a disruptive event that fissures ordinary forms of psychic continuity and therefore gains analytic attention in the present.",13
1282,The same structure can be utilized by the historian the writing of history can itself become a disruptive event and consequently a form of political intervention.,13
1283,V FOUCAULT'S PHANTASMS,13
1284,"If Foucault proposes the philosophy of the phantasm as a way for the historian to produce the meaning-effect of the event while still doing justice to its singularity, it also offers a way of thinking through some of the paradoxes that we have encountered in the problematic conceptualization of history.",13
1285,"From Sartre to Foucault history has repeatedly emerged as a contradictory concept, both totalizing and detotalizing, essentialist and non-essentialist.",13
1286,Such contradictions can be productive: the attempt to reject historicism absolutely results either in an utter particularism or in a surreptitious return of historicism in a different form.,13
1287,Only an understanding that recognizes that an irresolvable tension works within the historical schema itself will be in a position to make its contradictory claims productive.,13
1288,This possibility is outlined by Foucault himself as early as .,13
1289,He comments:,13
1290,"The more History attempts to transcend its own rootedness in historicity, and the greater the efforts it makes to attain, beyond the historical relativity of its origin and its choices, the sphere of universality, the more clearly it bears the marks of its historical birth, and the more evidently there appears through it the history of which it is itself a part…inversely, the more it accepts its relativity, and the more deeply it sinks into the movement it shares with what it is recounting, then the more it tends to  the slenderness of the narrative, and all the positive content it obtained for itself through the human sciences is dissipated.",13
1291,(371),13
1292,"History becomes the impossibility between this Scylla and Charybdis — in Lyotard's terms, it contains within its own project an incommensurable  .",13
1293,"It can only be described its organization an economy of logical tensions or strictures, of demands and constraints.",13
1294,"It is, as Derrida comments, a question of showing:",13
1295,"that history is impossible, meaningless, in the finite totality, and that it is impossible, meaningless, in the positive and actual infinity: that history keeps to the difference between totality and infinity.",13
1296,"Thus both historicism or entirely differentiated histories are in themselves impossibilities: history will always involve a form of historicism, but a historicism that cannot be sustained.",13
1297,It is thus a contradictory (quasi) concept — a phantasm — in which neither the elements of totalization nor difference can be definitively achieved or dispatched.,13
1298,This means that history can be theorized not a contradictory process but as a concept that must enact its own contradiction with itself: ‘this difference is what is called ’.,13
1299,"In this context, we may recall that Althusser, simply criticizing the notion of history as a totality as Foucault often tended to do, argued for the rearticulation of different histories within a decentred totality, on the assumption that history cannot do without one.",13
1300,"Was it simply incoherence on his part when he suggested that his ‘science of history’, it allows for differentiated histories, still demands to be considered within a general concept of history?",13
1301,"We have seen the ways in which Sartre's shows how totalization cannot work without a movement of self-transcendence, a repeated interpolation of an excess beyond the totality which paradoxically then means that the totality can be a totality.",13
1302,"Although Sartre's inability to effect self-totalization is often presented as a failure, the movement of history that he describes is increasingly enacted through his own writing.",13
1303,Such a shift is not immediately discernible in Foucault.,13
1304,His Deleuzian notion of the phantasmatic event constituted a brief attempt to reformulate the relation of the particular to the general as a problem of history.,13
1305,"But he made little effort to develop this outside his own definitions of the genealogical method, while his shift into the problematics of power seemed to lead him into a labyrinth from which it was virtually impossible to extract himself.",13
1306,"The philosophy of the phantasm may, however, help us to do justice to the event of Foucault himself.",13
1307,"One of the oddities of Foucault's work is that it seems riven by an internal tension — , as peter Dews notes, while on the one hand Foucault lays claims to a form of objectivity in his archaeology, and eschews interpretation ‘intelligibility’, on the  other hand throughout his life he was also prone to endorse a Nietzschean insistence on the interminability of interpretation.",13
1308,"For Dews this equivocation over the epistemological status of his own discourse is a sign of an uncontrollable oscillation: ‘the shifting perspectives of Foucault's work’, he writes, ‘do powerfully illuminate, but at the same time fall victim to, the contradictory processes which they address’.",13
1309,"But such a self-undermining of the epistemological status of his own work is also characteristic of Lacan, and of Freud — indeed, Dews argues that this constitutes Freud's greatest strength.",13
1310,"We might therefore wonder whether its appearance in Foucault, far from being the result of theoretical ineptitude, does not involve simulacra, or ghostly bad copies, similarly designed to undermine the claims of theoretical mastery, and to produce in his texts surface-effects of the kind of heterogeneity we might expect from someone who had contested the unifying function of ‘the author’.",13
1311,"history, the vacillations of Foucault's writing enact the impossibility of its simultaneous finitude and infinitude, the irresolvable conflict between history as meaning and history as difference, between history as a teleology and eschatology and history as the event, as finitude and mortality.",13
1312,Here we encounter the recognition that at a conceptual level the of history cannot be taken further: rather it can only be addressed through a tension in the writing itself.,13
1313,The early opposition between writing and history which enabled a critique from an outer limit has thus been replaced by a dissension within Foucault's own discursive practice.,13
1314,"locating the other elsewhere in the transgressive writing of literature or madness, Foucault himself becomes plato's banished poet, and enacts in his language a supplementary simulacrum of the delirium of history.",13
1315,"As Maurice Blanchot has put it: ‘And were not his own principles more complex than his official discourse, with its striking formulations, led one to think?’",13
1316,VI HISTORY AS POWER,13
1317,"In later work Foucault veers his most radical philosophical insights towards an analysis of discursive and extra-discursive systems of domination and exploitation, with increasing focus on the apparently more political question of power.",13
1318,"But perhaps this shift is not so distinct: for the interaction of power and resistance, which mimes the mutual contamination and transmutation of Freud's death-drive and pleasure principle, also operates is a simulacrum of the ungraspable, vacillating manoeuvres of Foucault's formulations of history.",13
1319,"Whereas Foucault was inclined to remark that in retrospect he considered that all his work had been about power, it seems almost equally possible that his analyses of power constitute a continuing meditation on the phantasm.",13
1320,"Although in no sense a general theory, Foucault's notion of power reformulates the problem of agency and determinism which had beset Sartre and many others by focusing on the  possibility of making intelligible the strategies and techniques of local operations of power without relying on the dialectic of ideology and the consciousness of subjects, or on their corollary, the assumption that power operates globally and homogeneously.",13
1321,The absence of the category of consciousness inevitably plays down the role of individual subjects and thus of individual agency and resistance as a result of specific acts of will.,13
1322,"If this causes difficulties for some, Foucault's scepticism the tendency to inflate the effect of individual agency can only be compared to the position of many Marxisms in which resistance and revolution are hardly the privilege of the individual as such, but rather of collective class action.",13
1323,Those who forget the virtues of solidarity to protest against the downgrading of individual agency might recall that it has been intellectuals who have been most prone to inflate the significance of individuals — particularly intellectuals — to the same degree that their theories propose universal categories and claim universal effects.,13
1324,Moreover the exclusive focus on ‘resistance’ as a privileged political category is itself open to question.,13
1325,"As with his genealogical history, Foucault's meditations on power are not themselves without problems, but reactions to them can also be too hastily dismissive, often because it is assumed that they are proposed as a general theory.",13
1326,", after the much has been made of Foucault's analysis of power as a form of totalizing paranoia; but the analyses in that book, of, , the shift from the Catholic confession box to the confessional psychoanalytic couch, are both culturally and historically specific, and Foucault's remarks about them need to be put in the same perspective.",13
1327,"After all, if ‘the system’ really was bent upon the form of totalizing control that Foucault psychoanalysis, , enables, it is worth recalling that psychoanalysis has never been adopted by the state as such and that its activities remain confined to a few very limited districts in a handful of prosperous cities round the world.",13
1328,"Similarly, those who claim that Foucault removes the possibility of resistance as such miss the point: all that he downgrades is a theory of resistance centred on the individual subject as sovereign agent.",13
1329,He argues that to focus analysis in this way neglects the disciplinary forms and technologies through which power operates.,13
1330,"The claim for a straightforward oppositional kind of resistance also assumes that subjects can resist from a position outside the operations of power, the dominant inside/outside model of conventional politics.",13
1331,"This is the context in which to place Foucault's own recognition after Derrida's critique that he could postulate madness or the other as outside, after which he maintained that the other is also always inside; he formulates the structures of power in exactly the same way, the forces of domination and resistance are caught up, sometimes indistinguishably, within .",13
1332,"Acts of resistance may continue to be initiated through individual acts of will, but Sartre  there is no guarantee that they will produce intended effects.",13
1333,"An awareness of this structure does not mean that strategic intervention is either useless or impossible; but it does mean that analysis of how resistance actually operates, in what conditions it succeeds or fails, needs an altogether more complex model.",13
1334,"Foucault's account of power is thus difficult to the degree to which he argues that the exercise and resistance of power work in a disruptive a dialectical relation to , suggesting that ‘points of resistance are present everywhere in the power network’.",13
1335,"Where there is power, there is resistance: what is often assumed, it is the of resistance which is impossible.",13
1336,power is a two-way process.,13
1337,"Just as the exercise of power is heterogeneous, so is resistance; Foucault's point is simply that ‘there is no single locus of great Refusal, no soul of revolt, source of all rebellions, or pure law of the revolutionary’.",13
1338,"Resistance does not operate outside power, nor is it necessarily produced oppositionally: it is imbricated within it, the irregular term that consistently disturbs it, rebounds upon it, and which on occasions can be manipulated to rupture it altogether:",13
1339,"Just as the network of power relations ends by forming a dense web that passes through apparatuses and institutions, without being exactly localized in them, so too the swarm of points of resistance traverses social stratifications and individual unities.",13
1340,"And it is doubtless the strategic codification of these points of resistance that makes a revolution possible, somewhat similar to the way in which the state relies on the institutional integration of power relationships.",13
1341,"It is in this way that Foucault can return to the possibility of doing historical work that has political force through his notion of genealogy, which means, as he puts it, ‘that I begin my analysis from a question posed in the present’.",13
1342,The question enables the tactical use of historical knowledge in contemporary political situations which necessitate the posing of the question with which genealogy begins.,13
1343,Such politics stress the local or the specific without assuming that they constitute the starting point for a global hegemony into which they will be subsumed.,13
1344,Foucault does not aim to produce ‘a’ politics any more than ‘a’history.,13
1345,"It is this factor which, perhaps above all, has enabled the critical use of Foucault's analyses of power in demarcated areas of analysis.",13
1346,"Ironically, Foucault's most problematic ‘theory’ has generated the most successful and probing historical work among his followers.",13
1347,VII CODA: THE NEW HISTORICISM,13
1348,"The relation of Foucault's politics to history leads to the question of the tactical use of Foucault himself in current forms of criticism; his extensive use by historians and sociologists, he is also associated with those movements that have become known as ‘new historicism’ and ‘cultural materialism’.",13
1349,"The former is identified closely with Foucault, while the latter owes its allegiance to Raymond Williams, and really only amounts to a way of describing British ex-Marxists.",13
1350,"New historicism is most concerned with the late Foucault, with representations and mechanisms of power, the means through which cultural artefacts can be shown to be not passive reflectors of the history of their time but active producers of it.",13
1351,"This charting of the circulating relations between aesthetic and other forms of production works best in those historical periods, the Renaissance, where there was no modern concept of Literature, thus allowing literary texts to be mapped against the political and other discourses of which they formed a part.",13
1352,"New historicism emphasizes the way in which certain rituals and practices, of kingship, are equally a part of the processes and representation of power — whether at a beheading, a masque or in a poem.",13
1353,"At the same time, it can also bring out the complex ways in which such forms of power also produce their own forms of resistance; as critics like Stephen Greenblatt demonstrate, these are not separable processes but are simultaneous effects of power.",13
1354,"The illustration of such a double logic working at a textual level often comes to seem remarkably close to a deconstructive analysis: in the same way as Derrida or de Man could be said to be deconstructing received readings that have institutional purchase, so the new historicists shift our understanding of institutionalized historical accounts.",13
1355,"However, the very historical focus poses the problem of agency and containment in a more immediate way that demonstrates some of the dilemmas that follow from Foucault's genealogical history.",13
1356,"The real difficulty, as Greenblatt shows, is what status can be accorded the category of subversion or resistance: what is the historical status of the ‘subversive, elements of a text?",13
1357,"If the process of the construction of knowledge can be shown to work against itself, this can operate because the ideas of the dominant order are not in fact threatened by alternatives which, with hindsight, may appear radical to us now.",13
1358,"As the cultural materialists concede, subversive thoughts are not subversive until they become a practice.",13
1359,Can they be shown to have had historical effects?,13
1360,"From the point of view of a radical politics, the onus on the critic, therefore, is to show the ways in which such subversions can be shown to have produced specific instances of change.",13
1361,"Correspondingly, as Greenblatt argues, Renaissance ideas which might be subversive today are ignored ‘radical’ ideas which seem to echo our own.",13
1362,"Both groups follow Foucault to the extent that they neither propose, nor utilize, a general theory of history as such; but unlike Foucault they simply tend to shelve the whole problem to avoid its theoretical difficulties.",13
1363,"So, despite the Lukácsian resonance of its name, new historicism abandons both the notion of history as a readable background to literary texts, and the Marxist dependency on reflection, in its effort to recontextualize literary texts in a more immediate way with other forms of social production.",13
1364,"For their part, the British cultural materialists quickly adopted a name which tactfully removes the suggestion of Marxism as such.",13
1365,"In the context of the present discussion of history, moreover, it is highly significant that traditional ‘historical materialism’ has been jettisoned the anthropological ‘cultural materialism’.",13
1366,The cultural materialists abandon the traditional Marxist use of history as a ground for truth bringing history into the present day to intervene in their own institutional and academic political context.,13
1367,"In this case it becomes less a matter of addressing contemporary political problems than of resisting institutional power, namely those critical readings which have recently claimed cultural hegemony, and of providing instead alternative accounts which insist on heterogeneity and resistance in historical texts.",13
1368,An identification is then implicitly or explicitly made with parallel forms of political struggle in our own day.,13
1369,"In other words, where yesterday's historian looked for the history of an oppressed working class, today's historian looks for marginalized groups, and those who have transgressed social norms.",13
1370,"Whether they actually were subversive becomes irrelevant to the extent that they can now be retrieved to offer a potential that has a contemporary, that is twentieth-century, political relevance.",13
1371,"To this extent we could say that the cultural materialists re-assert a form of reflection theory, where history has become a mirror in which contemporary political priorities have been substituted for the former certain ground of Marxist analysis.",13
1372,"The cultural materialists are inclined to separate the self-contradictory differences isolated by the new historicists into a more conventional political paradigm of opposing classes, of hegemony and subversion.",13
1373,"Similarly, though Foucault is often invoked, there is a marked tendency to continue to utilize theoretical categories ideology, consciousness and the subject.",13
1374,"Here it is salutary to recall Foucault's scepticism the ‘perilous ease’ with which politics quickly assumes positions that provide intellectual guarantees specific analyses of particular relations or transformations; he reacts in the same way to political analogies, and correspondences, or to hasty links with current political practices.",13
1375,"To the last, Foucault himself remained suspicious of any ‘progressive politics, if that meant that it continued to be linked to a (hidden) meaning, origin, or the subject.",13
1376,"But if the cultural materialists, unlike the more fastidious new historicists, cheerfully ignore the theoretical consequences of Foucault's work for many Marxist concepts, in other ways they are closer to him  they make clear in their work their own political priorities and commitments.",13
1377,"Nevertheless it is worth recalling that Foucault never starts at the political, but rather begins with a contemporary problem and then addresses questions to politics about it.",13
1378,"He argues that intellectual work need not always be measured against immediate political ends; rather the question to ask is what project is it undertaking, what problem is it analysing?",13
1379,It should always be possible for the intellectual to justify and to show the grounds on which any particular activity has been constituted.,13
1380,"At the same time, it is too easy to condemn certain forms of work for being apolitical simply because they do not correspond to a certain paradigm of immediate political effectivity.",13
1381,Political interventions can also work different time scales.,13
1382,"But if the cultural materialists tend to place a politics a problem as the starting point of their enquiry, they do emphasize the deployment of specialized knowledges in the service of the popular political struggles of today.",13
1383,"This suggests a closeness to Foucault's notion of genealogy that the more strictly academic new historicists, whose own politics remain more carefully hidden, ignore.",13
1,ARISTOCRATIC LIFE 98–1108,14
2,(a) The ruling class: its resources and means of self-aggrandizement,14
3,(i) Wealth,14
4,‘To him that hath shall be given’ was a truism of early medieval society.,14
5,"Because lords owned large tracts of land at a time when the opportunities for its exploitation were particularly favourable, and could add to this profit from tolls and customs on increasing trade, they could hardly avoid a substantial increase in their resources in the course of the eleventh century.",14
6,"But the fly in the ointment, from the princes' point of view, lay in the fact that their advantages were now more widely shared than they had been in the past.",14
7,"And in some cases, most strikingly in Normandy, the landed gains of castellans had been made at the expense of the comital demesne.",14
8,"There was thus a real danger, not of impoverishment, but of the closing of the gap between princes and other lesser lords, just at the time when display and liberality were increasingly important elements in princely political armouries.",14
9,Renewed effort to enrich themselves was therefore demanded.,14
10,", it seems likely that princes joined with other laymen and ecclesiastics in encouraging the extensive forest clearance that characterized the French countryside; but proof is lacking.",14
11,"The famous letter from the archbishop of Rheims to Baldwin V of Flanders, praising him for his activities in draining and ditching the coastal areas (presumably after the Dunkirk inundation of 1014–42 had subsided) is explicit evidence of an interest in agricultural expansion.",14
12,And the fact that wine-growing developed markedly on lands much visited by the dukes of Burgundy and Aquitaine is perhaps also suggestive of ducal initiative.,14
13,"On the other hand, it is unlikely that the duke of Normandy, who granted out the larger part of the demesne in feudal tenures, or the count of Toulouse, who was slow to consolidate his lands, was a major contributor to agricultural progress.",14
14,Encouragement of trade was more widespread.,14
15,"Again, the counts of Flanders were in the vanguard, with Robert the Frisian and Robert II offering protection for merchants crossing the county and their peace for the duration of fairs.",14
16,But as important was the provision of coinage suitable for reasonably small deals and sufficiently abundant for merchants to be able to rely on the supply.,14
17,"Here, Normandy was outstanding.",14
18,"As early as the beginning of the century, wealth in the county was reckoned in monetary terms; the implication that coins circulated freely was borne out when the Fécamp treasure was discovered in 1954.",14
19,"But by around 1020, the quality of Norman coins declined markedly as a concomitant to the rapid increase in quantity.",14
20,"Here there may have been a connection between the temporary weakening of ducal control over minting, in the troubles following Richard II's death, and the  of a currency useful for traders.",14
21,"In Aquitaine, too, this connection seems likely, in that silver coins modelled on those of Charles the Bald circulated until the serious financial crisis of 1103, brought on by William IX's crusading expenses; then the silver coin was devalued, followed in 1112 by a further devaluation, which preceded a period of marked economic growth.",14
22,"In Toulouse also, the steadily falling value of comital coins in the second half of the century made them relevant to the needs of the merchant classes.",14
23,"There was, , nothing disinterested about princely debasement; but in this instance, princely profit was consistent with mercantile gain.",14
24,Deliberate assistance to economic growth went hand in hand with administrative reform aimed at channelling its profits firmly into princely treasuries.,14
25,"This policy indicated that princes were ceasing to regard their demesnes, those ragbags of rights and scattered pieces of land, chiefly as means of buying support, whether on earth or in heaven, and were viewing them instead as permanent assets, to be cultivated in a more business-like fashion.",14
26,"Ironically the church, which had gained so much from the older cast of mind, was  prominent in propagating the newer outlook.",14
27,"For the monastic reformers Odilo of Cluny and Richard of St Vanne were renowned for their consolidation of monastic demesnes, their determination to ensure that what had once been granted to their houses should remain their inalienable property.",14
28,"Inspired by this objective, other churchmen, both bishops and abbots, appointed officials called for the task of collecting rents and dues from their estates.",14
29,Their examples were not lost on princes; Eudes II of Blois employed a in 1004 (see p. 196).,14
30,"These officials differed from their predecessors as tax- and rent-collectors, the and viscounts, they were rewarded, not with a , but with a cut from the profits.",14
31,"Initially, the office was often sold to the highest bidder, who would recoup his losses by assiduity in collecting.",14
32,But later it became hereditary.,14
33,"The job always excited unpopularity, sometimes even danger.",14
34,"Ademar of Chabannes told of the murder of the duke of Aquitaine's at St Jean d'Angély in 1026, and the destruction of his house by the angry inhabitants of the town.",14
35,"But despite the risks, for a man of ambition and determination the reward was ample; for a might bridge the gap between the upper peasantry and the lower echelons of the aristocracy.",14
36,The introduction of these new officials on princely estates was a piecemeal affair.,14
37,"Only in Flanders, where the comital demesne was in any case a large and solid block, was a complete network of created before the end of the century.",14
38,"Elsewhere, their appearance depended on favourable opportunity.",14
39,Some princes did not employ them until the second half of the century.,14
40,"And where they were employed, their duties varied from place to place — some fulfilled judicial financial functions, others might even have a military role.",14
41,But in performing their tasks all both reflected and further promoted the territorialization of power which was so prominent a feature of the eleventh century political scene.,14
42,Husbanding the demesne proved more difficult (except in Flanders) than appointing new officials to administer it.,14
43,"Huge grants of land to the church became rarer (but so did the chances of resuming what had once been granted); from  the middle of the century, gifts were more likely to be of from ecclesiastical lands or of other tolls and dues.",14
44,"But the real losses in princely revenues were to secular lords, by a process of slow attrition.",14
45,"For any moment of weakness in the fortunes of a great house — the minority of William the Conqueror, the early years of Fulk le Réchin — provided the perfect opportunity for castellans to establish their hereditary rights, or to exercise for their own benefit prerogatives which had hitherto brought profit to the princes.",14
46,The very substantial endowments most princes had accumulated in the ninth and tenth centuries could be curtailed without disaster in the favourable economic climate of the eleventh century.,14
47,And the assiduity with which Carolingian taxes like the or the were revived compensated in some measure.,14
48,"Nevertheless, it must be supposed that there were economic social inducements to the policies of expansion beyond the West Frankish frontiers pursued by the dukes of Normandy, Aquitaine, and even Burgundy, by the counts of Toulouse, Flanders, and for brief periods Blois and Anjou.",14
49,"Plunder proved a useful temporary boost to revenues; the annexation of new lands, with the opportunities for tougher exploitation which conquest brought in its train, could restore to princes their dominant position as the richest men within their principalities.",14
50,(ii) Justice,14
51,"In 1010 Raymond III of the Rouergue died, leaving to Conques abbey, among other gifts, an estate called Pallas in Narbonne.",14
52,"The monastery's right to Pallas was challenged by the Lady Garsinde, wife of Bernard le Velu, who declared that the estate had belonged to her first husband Raymond, from whom count Raymond III had taken it by force.",14
53,The monks' first attempt to obtain a judgement in their favour proved abortive; a second trial was therefore arranged at Pallas itself.,14
54,"The abbot of Conques travelled there with his knights and vassals, to put his case before the chosen arbitrator, a certain Bernard.",14
55,"Then the Lady Garsinde and Bernard le Velu arrived, accompanied by an even larger following.",14
56,"When each side had pleaded its cause very noisily, the arbitrator  decided the monks, though the Lady Garsinde was to receive a monetary recompense for abandoning her claims; a concord was to be drawn up.",14
57,"At this point, one of Garsinde's noble followers, unwilling to accept the verdict, arose and demanded that the decision be made not by arbitration but by battle.",14
58,"In the tumult which ensued, the terrified monks made their escape, only to find their way blocked by the same young lord with fifty knights, who threatened them with death.",14
59,"At this juncture, St Foy sent a storm, the aggressive aristocrat was struck by lightning, his terrified armed men ran away, and when the news of divine intervention reached her, the Lady Garsinde abandoned her case.",14
60,"So, , is the story presented by Bernard of Angers in the (it is clear, however, from the subsequent narrative that, whatever the short-term effects of the thunderbolt, Garsinde's claims were pursued again later by her husband.)",14
61,"But what is important in the episode is what the narrator takes for granted: that when men of standing disputed, arbitration was hard to arrange, and often immediately unacceptable to the party which felt itself the loser by the judgement, even where monetary compensation was offered to soften the blow.",14
62,This point was a truism for contemporary princes.,14
63,"In a case which occurred some time between 1037 and 1054, the abbot of Marmoutier complained in Geoffrey Martel's court that a certain Bouchard had seized back a mill which his brother, with Bouchard's consent, had earlier bestowed on the abbey.",14
64,"In the course of the hearing, Bouchard was brought finally to admit that the abbot's complaint was true.",14
65,"But pity for Bouchard's poverty, Geoffrey prevailed on the abbot to allow him possession of the mill for the rest of his life.",14
66,"The strictly legal weighing of rights and wrongs played only a subordinate role in the outcome of the case, even where the judge was, in other respects, assertive of his judicial strength (see pp. 187–8).",14
67,"and if Geoffrey chose to conciliate in aristocratic disputes over property, he was forced to the same resort on matters of crime; even powerful princes refrained from tough measures against those supporters essential to their own position.",14
68,"So, though Geoffrey  expressed his anger after the knight Walter had killed one of his kinsmen, he accepted two mills from him as the price of his peace.",14
69,"Likewise Robert the Frisian chose a mixture of mockery and persuasion, judicial force, to bring to heel one of his knights who had injured another in a brawl.",14
70,"Outright condemnation was as rare as condign punishment where the criminal was a man of high social standing; for if the delinquent vassal chose to submit himself to his lord, he had performed an act of self-abasement which, in itself, merited courteous handling.",14
71,"the system worked — some disputes were settled, some crimes fully atoned for — it did so because it accommodated to the plastic and multifarious notions of justice obtaining within a small group of men, known to from youth up, often related by marriage, who had to reckon on continuing to live as neighbours after the case was over.",14
72,"Because arbitration called for personal authority, tact, and understanding, some princes — Hugh of Burgundy, Robert II of Flanders — achieved a high reputation which attracted many disputes to their court.",14
73,"On the other hand, with the expansion of feudal ties, there was a growing expectation that any lord ought to resolve the disputes among his own vassals.",14
74,"As a consequence, even feeble princes like Fulk le Réchin met with requests for judgement.",14
75,"There was, however, a technical difficulty in the path of litigants: because princes' courts were peripatetic, they had to be pursued around the countryside, as Geoffrey le Preuil pursued Fulk le Réchin in 1093; and this fact offered a convenient excuse for those summoned by their lords as defendants in a case.",14
76,"In 1100, Geoffrey of Vendôme assured William IX of Aquitaine that he was trying to answer the summons to the ducal court, but that every time his messenger reached the appointed place, he found William had moved on.",14
77,"This may have been the simple truth; it may, alternatively, have been an instance of the use of delay by an intelligent but reluctant pleader.",14
78,For the great weakness of feudal jurisdiction lay in its lack of muscle to enforce the appearance of both parties in court.,14
79,"And this weakness was almost automatically exacerbated in some instances by the alternative of episcopal jurisdiction for infringements of  the Peace of God; this created procedural uncertainties in the minds of plaintiffs and judges, to delay yet further the chance of obtaining justice.",14
80,Only in Normandy were these problems transcended.,14
81,"Jurisdiction over the peasantry operated on markedly more authoritarian principles; as a result, it was both arbitrary and capable of producing solid financial rewards.",14
82,"But most of it had already escaped the princes' grasp in the tenth century; in the course of the eleventh, it passed squarely into the hands of local castellans, who exacted fines and imposed penalties on their peasants with remorseless vigour.",14
83,Princes derived profit solely from the courts on their own manorial lands or from those areas whose castellans were held in sufficient subordination to render dues to their lords.,14
84,"As the number of these dwindled, princely jurisdiction apparently reached its low point.",14
85,Yet there were spasmodic and disparate indications of development in the opposite direction.,14
86,Geoffrey Martel and Raymond of St Gilles both had some — though temporary — success in asserting the superiority of their courts over all others within their principalities.,14
87,"All over the south, men remembered, if they did not yet always act on, the tradition that serious offences, murder, rape, arson, ought to be justiciable in a higher court; by 1091, the declared this Carolingian survival to represent the practice in Normandy.",14
88,"In Flanders, the count's peace was becoming a meaningful concept, at fair times .",14
89,It was precedents like these which fired Philip 1 and his young son Louis VI to renewed policing of the royal demesne at the end of the century.,14
90,"Less visibly, but just as significantly, by confirming agreements reached between castellans or advocates and the communities over which they held sway, princes played their part in the evolution of customary law across the whole of West Francia.",14
91,And that role was not always simply confirmatory.,14
92,Geoffrey Martel claimed the right to abolish bad customs; William the Conqueror worked towards securing uniformity of custom across the whole duchy.,14
93,The trail was blazed for more active princely participation in the following century.,14
94,(iii) Military resources,14
95,"The exact date of the Vendôme charter, in which Count Bouchard gave full details of the military service owed to him from the area of Vendôme, is still controversial; but it is now accepted as an authentic document of the time of Fulk Nerra or Geoffrey Martel.",14
96,"The charter provides evidence of a surprisingly well-worked-out system to ensure castle-guard of the town: in April, May, June, July and August, it was the count's responsibility, though he paid only for the first two months directly his own treasury;, the inhabitants of the town produced a tax for the following three.",14
97,"Then the rest of the year was covered, a month at a time, by each of seven vassals, the fiefs they held of the count.",14
98,"Each night, five men were needed, three for the gates and two to move between them, so the responsibility was heavy.",14
99,The mixture of feudal service (the vassals' obligation) with mercenary forces (the count was reckoning to pay for his share of the duty) is characteristic of the eleventh century.,14
100,"After treating of castle-guard, the charter goes on to specify all the fiefs in the surrounding area, and their military obligations,and (long and short expeditionary duty).",14
101,"The document presupposes a direct connection between the fully mounted warrior and the fief, which is unusually specific for a period as early as this; it is therefore indicative of well-developed feudal institutions, in part of the area under Angevin control.",14
102,The drawback to feudal service from the count's point of view was its limited duration.,14
103,"The charter does not mention this, and the period may still have been imprecise; but it is not likely to have been above two months , which limited its usefulness considerably.",14
104,"As a consequence, feudal contracts in the full sense of the term must have been more important for supplying castle-guard than for campaigning (though it would be pushing the argument too far to deny them any significance in the field).",14
105,"In his with William V, Hugh de Lusignan was entitled , the commander of a thousand.",14
106,"Later it was recorded that the castellan of Amboise's army numbered  200 knights and 1,000 footsoldiers.",14
107,"Though the figures may well be inaccurate, they attest the contemporary impression that even local forces could be very large, in time of emergency.",14
108,How many of the 200 knights should be counted as members of Lisiard of Amboise's household cannot be determined; the number is rather more what one might expect of the household of a great prince.,14
109,"But some of them will have been men who lived permanently within their lord's gates, his closest companions, who, after several years' service, might hope to be rewarded with fiefs.",14
110,"Others may possibly have enjoyed what later came to be described as ‘money-fiefs’, the regular receipt of some tax or source of revenue service.",14
111,(Tenure of this sort was once regarded as an exclusively late development; but its roots are now thought to have been very old.),14
112,"Others again may simply have received pay for appearing to help Lisiard in his emergency, a battle with Thibaud of Blois.",14
113,"The large number of foot-soldiers suggests either that they were mercenaries, or that their presence was accounted for by a surviving obligation under the .",14
114,"Whichever it was, it argues for a strategy more concerned with battles, with expeditions, with sieges, than with to dominate the locality.",14
115,"In this, the lord of Amboise's armed forces provided a pattern for the future.",14
116,"Granted these sizeable forces at local level, the princes' military success on their own territories was dependent on their ability to win active support from their castellans.",14
117,"Supplicius of Amboise's refusal to assist Fulk le Réchin in the field, because Fulk's enemy was Thibaud of Blois to whom Supplicius had also paid homage, proved that the task was not always straightforward.i On the other hand, William the Conqueror was well supported against the royal invasions after 1051.",14
118,"When the campaign planned was one of aggression outside the principality, there were solid grounds for assisting it, in hopes of booty or even territorial gain.",14
119,"And an expedition which combined the prospect of gain with that of notable adventure, the forays into Spain or the Norman conquest of England, could rely on widespread support.",14
120,"In these cases, the prince might well be surrounded by vassals  who owed him military service; but they would be present not from obligation but from desire, and they would be accompanied by large numbers whose reason for being there had nothing to do with feudal ties or fidelity.",14
121,"William the Conqueror's host for the invasion of England, with its contingents of Bretons and Flemings, is proof that the military resources of princes could, on some occasions , far outrun knights' fees.",14
122,"Troops who fought for pay were little discussed in the sources; but Henry I's insurance policy in the treaty of 1101 — not invoked, as far as we know — cost £500 sterling a year.",14
123,The treaty shows that money could be a decisive element in warfare.,14
124,It also provides a glimpse of Flanders as a place where a substantial number of fighters could be expensively equipped and then encouraged to leave the county for long periods.,14
125,"This corner of West Francia, abandoned and defenceless in the late ninth century, had totally changed its character by the beginning of the twelfth.",14
126,Henry I was only concerned with hiring knights; hiring foot-soldiers was probably commoner.,14
127,It has been conjectured that the archers and many of the foot-soldiers who fought at Hastings and feature in the Bayeux Tapestry were fighting pay.,14
128,"The growing population, particularly in the towns of Flanders, provided the manpower for conflicts throughout West Francia; in the future, they were to collect an odious reputation for pillaging as they crossed the countryside.",14
129,Their great unpopularity may have been the consequence of the heavy financial burden they imposed on their employers; their mere existence is proof that money was circulating fast in western Europe; but that they were not always paid implies an economy too immature to support them readily.,14
130,(b) Feudal ties,14
131,"A notable innovation in the eleventh-century diplomatic vocabulary of the north was the occasional use of the term , a fief.",14
132,"Its late appearance was inexplicable to the older school of historians, which regarded fiefs as characteristic of social organization throughout the ninth to the  thirteenth centuries.",14
133,Nowadays its appearance constitutes a convincing argument for those who believe that fiefs and vassalage were insignificant in aristocratic society before about the second quarter of the eleventh century.,14
134,"But although the use of the new word probably does imply the growing importance of a hitherto minor institution, it may also reflect an intellectual change, a dawning awareness of the need for greater clarity in the realm of feudal relations.",14
135,A famous letter written by Fulbert of Chartres to William V of Aquitaine rehearsed the duties of the vassal in terms deliberately chosen to be easily remembered by the warriors to whom it was to be read:,14
136,"Fulbert's application of ideas drawn directly from two ancient manuals of rhetoric, the and Cicero's , to an entirely medieval social institution, is a vivid illustration of the way in which churchmen moulded the ethical perceptions of the military classes.",14
137,"In the letter, Fulbert used the words and interchangeably; a vassal was one who had sworn fidelity and who enjoyed a fief.",14
138,But there are signs that not all his contemporaries saw the relationship in such simple terms.,14
139,"Indeed, the cause of Duke William's concern on the matter was his clash with Hugh IV de Lusignan; in the course of this Hugh, embittered by William's failure to keep his word, renounced his oath of fidelity, except the count's  physical safety and the safety of Poitiers were concerned.",14
140,"His words implied that there were two grades of fidelity: one which obliged a to promote his lord's interests in all things, and another that simply bound him not to injure him.",14
141,"There was logic in this distinction; for if the duties of a vassal were Fulbert defined them, then in fulfilling them the whose estates were close to those of his lord would have to make many sacrifices, while for one who lived several days' journey away, not making a nuisance of himself would be a relatively painless matter.",14
142,Differences in perception of feudal obligation were partly a matter of simple distance.,14
143,Another variant in perspective was that lordship intensified as the social gap between lord and man increased.,14
144,"Yet even with vassals of the same class, there might be differences.",14
145,"Hubert le Hongre, a knight of the Mâconnais, lent his lord the castellan of Uxelles aid and counsel, witnessed his charters, testified for him in lawsuits, acted as hostage for his family, and entered Cluny's clientage when his lord became a monk.",14
146,"His whole life was bound up in this relationship, despite the fact that the fief he received was not large, and that he also possessed allodial lands.",14
147,"On the other hand, though the knights of the count of Vendôme (see p. 230) were heavily burdened with castle-guard and military service, their obligation was clearly defined, and once fulfilled, they were their own masters.",14
148,"As far as can be seen, they were not involved in their lord's personal life.",14
149,"There were, then, two models of knightly service.",14
150,"On occasion, the vassalage extorted from a noble might, like that of a knight, emphasize his dependence on his lord.",14
151,"When Herbert of Maine renounced his homage to Geoffrey of Anjou and recognized William the Conqueror as his lord, he received back everything from William ‘just as a knight received it from his lord’.",14
152,The point being made here was that William claimed superiority over all Herbert's lands; it was no mere personal bond he was enforcing.,14
153,The same might be inferred of the relationship between Baldwin IV and Baldwin V and the castellans of the comital demesne.,14
154,"Here the counts rubbed in their superiority by appointing in each castellany to collect comital dues, and by  taking direct homage from the knights of the castle; therefore the castellan could scarcely forget the conditional nature of his tenure.",14
155,"But any weakening, however temporary, in the prince's dominance would serve to produce a more normal relationship.",14
156,"Over West Francia as a whole, the eleventh-century castellans became but loosely subordinated to their princes.",14
157,"If fully independent castellans those of Bemy and the Mâconnais remained a rarity, nevertheless the princes' claim to control fortifications was spasmodically enforced, absent in practice if recognized in theory.",14
158,"For the concession of hereditary tenure, though made piecemeal over a long period of time, was universal by the end of the century.",14
159,"Only rebellion could deny a castellan his inheritance; then, the punishment might be harsh.",14
160,"In 1070, Fulk le Réchin, not content with disinheritance, pulled down the castle of Tréves, and blinded Hardouin, its lord.",14
161,"But , later eleventh-century castellans had contrived to convert their homage into little more than a symbol of deference and willingness to perform service; the implications that their castle and office were enjoyed purely by delegation, that their duty lay in exercising powers and privileges only for the benefit of their lord, were swiftly transmuted into something much less rigid; exactly what depended on the prince's powers and proximity.",14
162,"Perhaps ironically, one important factor preventing precision and continuity in princes' demands of their castellans was the intervention of other princes.",14
163,"Royal control over the castellans of the Ile de France was relaxed by Eudes II of Blois, who created his own network of vassals among them; in the same way, the dukes of Aquitaine attracted the lords of Parthenay to their court, though they were Angevin vassals.",14
164,"Although, in the short term, these manoeuvres attained their political objectives, in the end they simply conferred new independence on the castellans.",14
165,"Double allegiance could be a useful weapon, as Supplicius of Amboise had found (see p. 231).",14
166,"In 1090 the lord of Montpellier exploited it even more successfully when he rose against his lord, the bishop of Maguelonne; worried by William's defection, the bishop bribed him back into the  episcopal by extending his fief.",14
167,"In return, William was required to recognize that, since the fief he held of the bishop was now larger than those any other lord had bestowed on him, he ought to be ‘a better man’ of the bishop than of any of his other lords.",14
168,"To mount the social scale again, the higher the rank of the underdog, the less his obligation would be defined.",14
169,"When the counts of La Marche and Périgueux paid homage to the duke of Aquitaine, it implied acceptance on their part that to injure the duke's person or property would be a breach of faith, but little more; if they came to his court or assisted him on campaigns, it was because they saw profit or pleasure in so doing.",14
170,"A similar relationship obtained between the count of Flanders and the comital family of Boulogne, between the Capetians and the old-established comital families of the Ile de France, between the dukes of Burgundy and the counts of Mâcon, Chalon, and Meaux.",14
171,"At the apex of the pyramid came the princes' homage to the king — where they took it (excluding therefore the counts of the far south and of Brittany, and the duke of Normandy after the breach of 1051).",14
172,"Helgaud reported that Robert the Pious secretly removed the relics from the reliquary on which he obliged his (magnates) to take oaths, to shield them from committing perjury.",14
173,"The tale, if true, showed little confidence in the princes' intention to abide by the exact words of their fidelity.",14
174,But what was implied by the oath was genuinely in dispute.,14
175,"At the beginning of the century, Dudo of St Quentin produced the argument that, since the homage of Duke Rollo of Normandy in 911 had been purely in gratitude for his baptism, it did not mean, either for himself or for his successors, that Normandy was a fief.",14
176,Rather Rollo and they had rendered services to than to God.,14
177,"A less elevated but similar claim was made by Eudes II in a letter written to King Robert: ‘If it is a question of the nature of the benefice you gave me, the fact is that it does not come from your domain, but from the estates which come to me with your consent by hereditary right from my ancestors.’",14
178,"In Eudes's eyes, then, he held Champagne hereditarily; it was not the king's decision to grant or not to grant.",14
179,The  fact that the king thought differently on both these issues was of little moment.,14
180,"On the other hand, William of Poitiers imputed to Guy Geoffrey, Thibaud, and Geoffrey Martel irritation at being obliged to perform military service when summoned — which suggests acceptance of their duty; Orderic's words imply that Fulk the Young clearly recognized the dependent status of Anjou in 1106 when he did homage to Philip I. The differences of opinion on a point that later lawyers were to regard as fundamental to the monarchy's position must be taken as proof that, for the great , the equation between a and a could not yet be taken for granted.",14
181,"Interestingly, there are signs that those who had escaped from the royal were not entirely comfortable in their independence.",14
182,"In the absence of the king, they sought a higher authentication of their rights.",14
183,"So Raymond of St Gilles, after he had claimed the Rouergue in 1079, prepared himself for his attempt to oust his brother as count of Toulouse, in a ceremony at the shrine of St Robert at La Chaise-Dieu:",14
184,"The adoption of an overlord in heaven lent weight to Raymond's doubtful title in Toulouse, while infringing not on his earthly independence.",14
185,So the patron saint had become absorbed into the feudal world.,14
186,"It was an example that, in rather different circumstances, was later to commend itself to the Capetians.",14
187,(c) Ruling families,14
188,"As the count of Roucy journeyed to Rome, he fell into a trap laid by Falco, count of Burgundy, who demanded, as the price of his release, his daughter's hand in marriage.",14
189,The incident shows that force might still play some part in the creation of  alliances in the eleventh century.,14
190,"But the swashbuckling approach grew rarer; and with the  disappearance of the Carolingian and Ottonian houses a measure of excitement drained the game, for neither Capetian nor Salian brides enjoyed the same cachet as their predecessors.",14
191,"In any case, as a result of the growing emphasis on patrilineal descent in all aristocratic families, even the noblest of wives could do less for an eleventh-century lord than she could have done for his grandfather.",14
192,"The marriage between Robert the Pious's daughter and the count of Nevers brought obvious political gain to the king because it strengthened the royal hold upon Burgundy; the count on the other hand gained only temporary advantage, and subsequent generations in Nevers made little of their royal connection.",14
193,Behind this change lay a new and more business-like concentration on landed possession.,14
194,"Symbolic of this was the slow decline in the importance of marriage portions conferred by husbands on their new wives, and a correspondingly avid interest in the bride's dowry.",14
195,Dowries could prove major blessings; that brought by the heiress of Rennes to Hoël of Nantes transformed the otherwise weak count into a major landholder.,14
196,"But if the wife died before her husband, his right to keep the dowry might well be challenged by her family.",14
197,"The war that broke out between Richard II of Normandy and Eudes II of Blois in 1013–14 was over Eudes's right to retain the dowry of his dead wife, Richard's sister.",14
198,"And Raymond of St Gilles attacked the Rouergue immediately on the death of its countess, married to Robert of the Auvergne, allow his family's claims to her lands to be forgotten.",14
199,"Without military strength to assist in their retention, dowries could prove but short-term gains.",14
200,"On the other hand, marriage might still create claims to territory which good luck and force could convert into possession.",14
201,"Although in the end William IX of Aquitaine failed to make good his wife's right of succession to her father in Toulouse, a generation earlier his father Guy Geoffrey had succeeded in annexing Gascony, pleading in justification his father's marriage with the heiress Prisca.",14
202,"And marriage beyond the frontiers of the West Frankish kingdom was seen as a preparatory step towards expansion by the counts of Flanders in their dealings with the  houses of Hainault and Holland, by the ducal houses of Burgundy and Aquitaine in Aragon, Barcelona, and Navarre, and by the count of Toulouse in Provence.",14
203,(These alliances had the additional advantage of earning ecclesiastical approval at a time when there was growing pressure from canonists against unions within six degrees of relationship.),14
204,"Because the death-rate was high, marriages were usually short-term; and divorce could be obtained where nature did not intervene.",14
205,"On the other hand, greater prosperity and more settled political conditions combined to make barrenness less common than in the tenth century; Geoffrey Martel of Anjou and Duke Hugh of Burgundy were unusual in producing no heirs.",14
206,Problems were now far more likely to arise in determining the rights of succession among competing members of a princely family.,14
207,"It has been stated that the principle of primogenital succession was increasingly observed in the eleventh century; but there was a substantial difference between accepting the customary right of the eldest son to succeed, if he were of age and competent, and accepting it as an inviolable rule, as was proved by the usurpation of Robert the Frisian, and perhaps also by the succession of Raymond IV of Toulouse (though here the facts are rather uncertain).",14
208,And the plight of even generously endowed younger sons like William Rufus and Eon of Penthièvre could arouse sympathy among their contemporaries.,14
209,"Besides, where a prince had contracted one marriage, there might be disputes among the offspring of his various wives, as occurred after the death of William V of Aquitaine, and in 1032 in the royal family.",14
210,"On that occasion the energetic opposition to Henry I's accession put up by Constance of Arles and her sons created a serious crisis, in the course of which Henry was driven to take refuge at the court of the duke of Normandy.",14
211,"Though in the end his rights prevailed, the dispute had long repercussions on his control over the counts and castellans of the demesne.",14
212,"So primogeniture was not automatically accepted; and where it was, it could create problems of a rather different sort.",14
213,"Heirs grew over-ambitious: both Baldwin V of Flanders and Geoffrey Martel the Younger rebelled against their fathers in an attempt to establish their own dominion  time; more problematically, princes had the headache of finding adequate endowments for their younger sons without infringing on the patrimony.",14
214,"But despite its drawbacks, primogeniture did offer a rule of thumb that commanded widespread respect.",14
215,"So the real difficulty remained in families where there was no direct heir, as the Angevin succession crisis of the 1060s proved.",14
216,"Perhaps a mature perception of this fact lay behind the rather surprising  of most Norman lords in William the Conqueror's succession as duke in 1035, though he was but a child and a bastard.",14
217,The uniqueness of this step was long remembered.,14
218,"As late as the 1180s, St Hugh of Lincoln dared to tease Henry II of England about the tanner's blood in his veins.",14
219,"(William's mother was thought to have been Herleva, daughter of Fulbert, a tanner of Falaise).",14
220,"William of Poitiers strove to emphasize the nobility of the West Frankish aristocracy, by calling Guy Geoffrey the Emperor Henry III's brother (he was his brother-in-law through the marriage of his sister Agnes), and by ascribing to Baldwin V connections not only with the ruling houses of France and Germany, but also with that of Constantinople (what he had in mind has not yet been established).",14
221,"Nevertheless it seems that the eleventh-century history of princely houses was more mundane, more businesslike, than it had been in the past.",14
222,"Marriage and inheritance were matters for bargaining and negotiation, open to inspired manoeuvres.",14
223,"And it is notable that harmony in succession policy evaded those whose political achievements were otherwise outstanding — Geoffrey Martel, Baldwin V, William the Conqueror.",14
224,Indeed it might almost be conjectured that those families in which political nous was widely distributed were just those that found the principle of primogeniture unpalatable.,14
225,(d) Courts,14
226,The life of the high aristocracy was lived on the move and in the open; tranquillity and privacy evaded them.,14
227,"For a lord's status was directly related to the size of following he could support, and the larger his entourage the more frequently he had to move from estate to estate to feed them.",14
228,The count  of Flanders was usually accompanied by between fifty and a hundred armed men; the duke of Aquitaine took a hundred knights with him on a visit to the viscount of Ventadour.,14
229,"Besides, there were the animals.",14
230,"Duke Robert of Burgundy expected Gilly, an estate of St Germain-des-Prés, to provide food for his dogs lodging for his horses and their grooms.",14
231,It was hardly surprising that few places could afford to entertain their lords for weeks on end.,14
232,"On the march, there was little room for ceremonial.",14
233,"When Geoffrey de Preuilly caught up with Fulk le Réchin's men to obtain a hearing for his plea, he found the count sitting on a table, his steward standing before him, his huntsman below, mounted and carrying the count's falcon.",14
234,The scene suggests a lifestyle familiar to the Franks from their first penetration of Gaul.,14
235,"Just as informally, William the Conqueror once confirmed a grant ‘while sitting on his carpet between the church and the forester's house.’",14
236,"Dirty, bloodstained, and exhausted lords surrounded by brutal warriors, making their way from primitive wooden castles to austere monastic refuges, must have been common sights on the West Frankish roads.",14
237,"And if, on occasion, they pillaged or, like the following of Eudes of Burgundy, held up caravans of pilgrims and merchants to make a quick profit from their ransoms, few can have been surprised; for it was adventure, self-interest, and companionship that bound knights to their lords.",14
238,"Rarely can St Augustine's dictum that bands of brigands are but petty kingdoms without justice (, iv, 4) have been so easily comprehended as in the eleventh century.",14
239,"There were, however, short breaks from the itinerant routine, when the great festivals of the church provided occasions for large gatherings, rich feasts, fine dress.",14
240,"Princes usually celebrated Easter, Christmas, or Whitsun in cathedral towns or important monastic centres within their territories, giving advance notice of their intention other lords might  with them.",14
241,"When Robert II of Flanders passed Christmas at St Omer, ‘there came to him the dukes, the counts, the lords of many regions, nobles and knights from the whole of Flanders, and many French bishops’.",14
242,"In such company, the ancient rituals of Christian worship shed  their warm glow of splendour on the court.",14
243,There might be some ceremony of welcome; there might be special prayers for the ruling family (the genealogies of the counts of Flanders at St Bertin and the counts of Anjou at St Aubin's suggest this).,14
244,"And occasionally the bishop might call for the , the litany ‘addressed solely and triumphantly to the victorious Christ in his divinity as the eternal king of heaven and earth, and as the exemplar and guarantor of power and prosperity to all who upheld the fabric of a unitary Christian society — pope, king, royal family, clergy, lay magnates and warriors’.",14
245,"This litany served to keep alive in French Christian memory the true place of the king as Christ's representative on earth, at a time when political realities bade fair to obliterate it; but it also elevated the lower ranks of earthly powers.",14
246,"Only the duke of Normandy presumed to make this explicit, allowing his own name to be introduced into the chant after the prayers for the French king, the congregation called on the great warrior saints to guarantee the duke's safety and perpetual peace.",14
247,His arrogance was soon rewarded by a royal position which legitimated it.,14
248,But the caution of other princes may not have blinded their followers to the possible propaganda value of the .,14
249,"Beyond the portals of the church, festival days were active ones.",14
250,"Bishops might seize the opportunity to urge support for peace councils, abbots to press for protection, lay lords to obtain charters while plentiful clerical help was available to draw them up and suitably important men present to act as witnesses.",14
251,"With his friends and allies about him, a prince might discuss future strategy, consider marriage alliances, resolve disputes.",14
252,"Far from being rest days, the festivals of the church were times of heightened activity, in an atmosphere redolent of older, grander, more disciplined ways.",14
253,"As the century wore on, the returning prosperity of the countryside brought a markedly higher standard of living in its train for those best able to exploit their opportunities;, the revival of trade facilitated the acquisition of luxuries.",14
254,"Inevitably, princely trains grew to expect more lavish hospitality from the castles and monasteries that they visited.",14
255,"When Robert II of Flanders called at St Thierry with his  sister, widow of Cnut IV of Denmark, the abbot Rudolph cleansed the whole building, hung it with rich hangings and tapestries, filled it with carvings, sculptures, and other precious objects, to turn his simple Benedictine house into a suitable environment for the reception of so magnificent a prince.",14
256,"Though his extravagance was well rewarded, it must have placed a severe strain on the house's finances.",14
257,"living at their own expense, princes had higher expectations.",14
258,"Fécamp, Bruges, Limoges, Chartres, Dijon provided backdrops for displays of occasional grandeur.",14
259,"Because attracting important men to his presence was essential to princely authority, ostentation might offer sound political investment.",14
260,"A prince's entourage provided his closest friends, his most trusted servants, the knights on whom he relied in time of crisis.",14
261,"Throughout the century, these households retained the military character that was at the core of their lord's authority.",14
262,"The household of William the Conqueror was the nerve-centre from which his military victories were planned, from which his duchy and the kingdom of England were held in subordination; its lay members held themselves always ready for battle.",14
263,"The armed following that accompanied Robert the Frisian on his Jerusalem pilgrimage so impressed the Emperor of Byzantium, Alexius Comnenus, with its martial bearing that he requested similar assistance from the west.",14
264,"Although many household knights were men of free noble birth — in Flanders there were even recruits from among the unfree, like the German — the prince's relatives and the sons of his neighbouring lords also found careers within their ranks.",14
265,"So in the long term, the entourages of the great proved effective as social melting-pots.",14
266,"Yet as the century wore on, their military character ceased to be the exclusive distinguishing feature of princely households.",14
267,"When the countess Adela of Blois issued an important charter, it was noted that she was surrounded by her and her .",14
268,"her chaplain and her clerks, barons, knights, and servants.",14
269,"The household chaplain, whose role it was to minister to the spiritual needs of princely families, could also produce letters, those written for Stephen of Blois to his wife  Adela while he was on the First Crusade; or charters, like those produced for the post-Conquest dukes of Normandy.",14
270,"In Normandy, indeed, their importance grew so great that they began to be promoted to bishoprics after about 1060, a move reminiscent of Ottonian and Salian practice.",14
271,"William of Poitiers, William the Conqueror's most learned and literate biographer, had been his master's chaplain for some years; in the future, household chaplains were regularly to combine the roles of secretary, teacher, and propagandist for princes, as he had done.",14
272,The mixture of usefulness and display that explained the growing importance of the chaplains also lay behind the rise of other household officers.,14
273,"With growing princely income and expenditure, the charge of the purse became more responsible; chamberlains appeared everywhere — in Flanders as early as the tenth century — to control it.",14
274,"Then large households required butlers and stewards to satisfy their material needs, marshals for ceremonial.",14
275,"Someone must always have discharged these duties; but the mention of these officials in eleventh-century households pointed to two developments: firstly, a conscious imitation of Carolingian ways (for Charlemagne and his heirs had surrounded themselves with seneschals and stewards), and secondly, a revived interest in administration.",14
276,"It is perhaps characteristic that the best evidence for the appointment of household officers in the first half of the eleventh century should come from Normandy, which combined reverence for the Carolingian past with respect for efficiency to a degree unparalleled elsewhere.",14
277,"By the second half of the century, the practice was spreading.",14
278,"In Flanders, in Champagne, in Anjou, on the royal demesne, chamberlains, butlers, stewards, marshals made their appearance.",14
279,"Because their duties involved close co-operation with the prince, their holders were usually men of high social status, the prince's more intimate friends among his following.",14
280,"In ceremonial, their role was everywhere prominent; interestingly, some household officials were beginning to discharge governmental functions, as in Normandy.",14
281,"But their commonest duty was to act as witnesses in charters;, by the last two decades of the century, the royal household officials were excluding other lords from this task.",14
282,"the knights, the chaplains, and the officials, there travelled the ladies of the court with their servants, and a sizeable contingent of young boys.",14
283,"Of these, some were present involuntarily, as hostages for their father's good behaviour — Supplicius of Amboise, , had to put his son Hugh in Fulk le Réchin's power as one of the terms of a peace treaty; but others were the sons of friends or allies, sent to the prince's court for the sake of education in knightly virtues, and to meet the men on whom their future political happiness could depend.",14
284,Princely households had common characteristics with the English public schools of past generations.,14
285,"And though they too set social connection and sporting activities — hunting, combat, riding — above literacy, nevertheless it was possible to acquire learning at them; the opportunities exploited by William V of Aquitaine, William the Conqueror, Robert the Frisian, and Fulk le Réchin — all regarded as educated men — must have also been available to some of those who were brought up with them.",14
286,"So eleventh-century courts were centres for ceremony, business, education; Charlemagne would have sympathized with all of these.",14
287,"He would have understood, too, the presence at Norman and Angevin courts of clerks whose function it was to extol the deeds of their princes.",14
288,"But, despite Einhard's assertion that he loved barbarian poems, he would surely have been disconcerted by the evolution of the Poitevin court under William IX as a centre of troubadour poetry, its prince as the most distinguished poet of all.",14
289,"And he might well have dismissed the Flemish court, with its prince who hedged and ditched, its chancellor who audited accounts, as mercenary.",14
290,"What must have surprised him, as it still surprises us, was the sheer variety of court life, its different rhythms, its stately ceremonial in buildings still primitive both by Carolingian and later standards, and the unique character bestowed on each court by the personality of its prince.",14
291,SOURCES 1108–1180,14
292,"IN the twelfth century, writing blossomed.",14
293,"Once an élite activity, almost the exclusive prerogative of monks, it now spread to the swelling ranks of secular clerks, to servants in princely households, even to some ordinary townsmen.",14
294,"As it spread, its uses diversified so fast as to make any introduction to twelfth-century sources on the scale attempted in the earlier parts of the book (pp. 17–26, 124–32) impossible.",14
295,Nor indeed is it necessary; for the men of the twelfth-century renaissance used words and literary forms derived from the main stream of the European cultural inheritance.,14
296,Their writings speak for themselves.,14
297,"In fact that familiarity can sometimes be deceptive; behind the restored classical vocabulary lurk more of the earlier aristocratic assumptions than would have been conceded by most nineteenth-century historians; so if anthropological interpretations become less useful, there is still danger in pushing narrowly juridical ones.",14
298,But it must be said that the historian's task is substantially simplified by the transformation.,14
299,Therefore the point of this section is only to draw attention to some aspects of intellectual and administrative change that can be more easily observed in a discussion on sources than in a more general context.,14
300,"Few literary sources are more revealing of aristocratic culture than the and its off shoot the , produced in the Touraine in the first six decades of the twelfth century, for the pleasure and edification of the counts of Anjou and their castellans, the lords of Amboise.",14
301,The skeleton of the lay in a set of genealogies less reliable and less complete than those found at St Aubin's in Angers under Fulk le Réchin.,14
302,"These may originally have been compiled by a Touraine monastic house the new rulers of the area could be commemorated in its prayers; but like the genealogies of the comital house of Flanders, they were soon adapted to a more secular purpose.",14
303,"Around 1109 on the death of Fulk le Réchin, a monk, perhaps the abbot Eudes of the great house of Marmoutier, produced the first version of the , a series of brief biographies of the counts.",14
304,"The literary form he followed derived from the , that famous compilation of papal lives produced in Rome at the end of every pontificate by the pope's own clerks; especially in West Francia it had been adopted in the tenth and eleventh centuries as a model for the history of dioceses (e.g. the .",14
305,And it now provided a convenient framework for the praise of a comital lineage.,14
306,"The author set the context for his story with a lengthy but fairly conventional genealogy of the kings of France, tracing their origins back to the Trojans as Frankish historians had done since Merovingian times.",14
307,This blend of Old-Testament-inspired genealogy with legendary classical origins enjoyed a new vogue in the eclectic learned circles of the period.,14
308,"A possible Trojan link was claimed by William of Jumièges for William the Conqueror he became king; a late eleventh-century genealogy of the counts of Boulogne produced a similar conceit; and Genealogy IV of the Counts of Flanders, written about 1120, made them the most important non-royal family to trace its ancestry back to Priam.",14
309,So a legend which had originated with the attempts of Dark Age royal servants to give their masters a lineage as old and distinguished as that of the Western Roman emperors they had displaced continued in the twelfth century to satisfy the needs of new royal families and even of some princely houses.,14
310,"In the this genealogy creates a sharp contrast between the kings and the counts of Anjou, whose origins are said to lie in a ‘new man’, a forester of the reign of Charles the Bald.",14
311,", the choice of such a humble beginning is puzzling, especially since Werner believes that the Angevin comital family was of the old Carolingian aristocracy, with connections by marriage into an Italian royal family.",14
312,"But it is clear from Fulk le Réchin's history that the counts themselves knew nothing of their ancestry before the time of  Ingelgerus, Fulk the Red's father, an indication of the block that earlier, looser kinship ties created in human memory.",14
313,"Besides, the author of the — like his predecessor who had produced the second genealogy of the counts of Flanders — was heavily imbued with Sallustian learning.",14
314,"If he could not posit an ancient line for his comital family, then he would choose to emphasize its newness, its local roots, its dependence on heroic deeds for its rise.",14
315,"For it was possible, on a reading of Marius' in Sallust, to associate the old nobility with inertia, the new with virtue.",14
316,"The choice of a forester — also made by the author of a thirteenth-century Flemish genealogy — is interesting: the word itself was a new one, having no classical or late-antique Latin form; perhaps its associations with hunting and riding made it particularly appropriate for a family renowned for its martial skills.",14
317,"From the author's point of view, its humble status highlighted the outstanding achievements of the individual counts in each generation of the family's history.",14
318,"So though modem research has tended to discredit the idea of a medieval aristocracy ‘of service’, to insist on blue blood for the great lines of the tenth and eleventh centuries, and to see in the later eleventh and the twelfth centuries an ever-sharper patrilineal descent obliterating other considerations in family history, it should not be forgotten that one great princely house was encouraged to view its progress in quite other terms.",14
319,What made them lords were their noble deeds.,14
320,"The clearest proof of this comes in the treatment of Geoffrey Grisegonelle, Fulk Nerra's father.",14
321,"Whereas, in Fulk le Réchin's account which preserved the comital family's own early tradition, Geoffrey was a solid but unremarkable figure, in the he has undergone transmogrification.",14
322,"He is a chivalric hero, a mighty slayer of the Danes, a triumpher in single combat, a victor over the invading German hordes.",14
323,"Halphen, who edited the text, believed that here the author was drawing on a vernacular epic; this may well have been so, for in the late eleventh-century manuscript of the , Geoffrey featured as Charlemagne's standard-bearer.",14
324,He had become a figure of legend.,14
325,His appearance in his new guise in the pinpoints the process by which the house of Anjou built up its own chivalric myth.,14
326,"Fulk le Réchin, the other counts of Anjou are portrayed (albeit less colourfully than Geoffrey Grisegonelle) as pious and valiant defenders of their inheritance.",14
327,"Fulk, however, comes in for stern criticism.",14
328,"Indeed the aim of the work was to demonstrate how far he had fallen from ancestral glories, that his successors might rectify his errors.",14
329,"The earliest version of the , finished just after Fulk's death in 1109, was a stern warning to the young Fulk V.",14
330,"But the story of the did not end in 1109. just as later monks came back to the Flemish comital genealogies to keep them and to add new material, so the attracted amplification.",14
331,"The first to turn his hand to the task was Thomas de Loches, chaplain and chancellor to Fulk V and Geoffrey le Bel.",14
332,The significance of his additions lies largely in the proof they provide that a Touraine monastic source was the subject of study within the count's own household by a secular clerk of distinction.,14
333,"His successor Breton d'Amboise's version was more influential it provided the base for three other amplifications, one anonymous, the other two by John of Marmoutier.",14
334,"Of the latter, one was dedicated to King Henry II of England in a prologue taken almost word for word from Bede's preface to Ceolwulf at the beginning of the .",14
335,There could hardly be a more appropriate blending of Henry II's traditional Angevin and new English cultural backgrounds.,14
336,Each of the later authors added to the legendary element in the .,14
337,"The figure whose character achieved clearest focus was that of Fulk the Good, Geoffrey Grisegonelle's father.",14
338,"Plagiarizing from the , Breton produced material to turn Fulk into the conventional saintly layman who, assisting a leper, found that he had helped Christ.",14
339,"It was recorded of him that he sang with the monks in the divine offices; when taunted by the king for his clerkly tastes, he responded that an illiterate king was a crowned ass (a cliché much favoured in twelfth-century Angevin circles, for it sprang from a sense of family superiority — the counts of Anjou were, by any standards, learned men).",14
340,So Fulk joined Geoffrey as an alternative model of the perfect layman.,14
341,"adding to the old part of the story, the continuators brought it till the death of Geoffrey le Bel, occasionally slipping into detailed narrative of events: there is a long and useful excursus on the politics of 1118.",14
342,"The original epic style was maintained for the description of Fulk V's Jerusalem journey and his coronation as king of Jerusalem in 1131, which was portrayed as the fulfilment of the family destiny, the union of its chivalric and pious traditions.",14
343,All in all the provided a somewhat daunting set of exemplars for King Henry II.,14
344,His ancestors were formidable men.,14
345,"And — despite the fact that their portraits were largely drawn by monks — they were men in a distinctively lay tradition: not for them Gerald of Aurillac's yearning for the cloister; though they might put their sword to the service of the church, they wielded it just as often for secular purposes and to gain renown.",14
346,"Their piety was set in a classical mould, a matter of obligations duly performed.",14
347,Their chief functions were of this world.,14
348,"They were , men chosen for the protection of the common weal, men of ancient Roman and .",14
349,"The original version of the provided a model for the , written about 1155; and it, in its turn, influenced later versions of the .",14
350,"Its author, perhaps a canon of St Florent, wrote after the death of Supplicius II, castellan of Amboise, to warn later generations of the family that a repetition of Supplicius' acts of disloyalty towards his overlords might ruin the family.",14
351,"Yet despite his didactic purpose and his concern with detailed narrative, he produced the first work to immortalize a castellan dynasty in France.",14
352,"From the historian's point of view, it provides valuable evidence about a corner of the Touraine crucial to Angevin domination but very difficult to hold, and about the resources and stratagems open to a second-rank aristocratic family determined to maximize its assets.",14
353,"It is an unusually vivid piece of local history, told with an absence of contrivance or literary device that contrasts with its model.",14
354,"Together, the works bear witness to the originality and liveliness in the learned circles of the Loire valley at the height of the twelfth-century renaissance.",14
355,The of 1172 shows originality of a different order.,14
356,"It was compiled for Count Henry the Liberal  of Champagne, by clerks of tidy but innovative mind, alert to the political potential in acquiring, recording and categorizing information.",14
357,"They set out to discover the names and fiefs of all lords and knights resident within the county, their liege lords, and the services each owed to the count.",14
358,"The means employed was the sworn inquest, the ancient Carolingian legal procedure for establishing the facts of a case by procuring statements on oath.",14
359,"Although this procedure had been used for administrative purposes in Normandy (where the English example of Domesday Book was an inspiration) and in Anjou before Geoffrey le Bel's conquest of Normandy, the marked an important step in its use in eastern France.",14
360,"When the sworn statements were collected and sorted, the results were set out in a list preserved in the count's treasury at St Etienne in Troyes.",14
361,"Until 1190, they were kept up-to-date; but in that year, Count Henry II of Champagne took one copy of the list with him when he set out for Outremer, and this may have inhibited his officials from making further changes in the copy left behind at Troyes.",14
362,"Nevertheless, the document was still consulted in the early thirteenth century, which shows that it was regarded as an important statement of custom.",14
363,"In committing the count's rights to written record, Henry's clerks had conferred on them new authority.",14
364,"The contains the names of around 1,900 lords and knights, ranging from substantial aristocrats to landless warriors, grouped under the headings of the twenty-six castellanies of Champagne.",14
365,The grouping demonstrates Henry's clerks' clear conception of the administrative geography of the county.,14
366,"On the other hand, the fact that some lords and knights are double-listed suggests doubt their rightful position.",14
367,"It seems likely, therefore, that in the process of drawing up the , as clerks and local lords decided under which heading most fief-holders should appear, they helped to crystallize the castellanies.",14
368,"And if the process of inquest clarified internal boundaries, it almost certainly also compelled fief-holders to reflect on the extent of the services they owed to the count.",14
369,Henry's clerks had perceived the important truth that asking the right questions was the path to consolidating gains.,14
370,All respondents  acknowledged they owed service in times of war; rather less than half were obliged to provide regular castle-guard.,14
371,The figures were high for a county in which comital lordship had not been noticeably demanding; the count's fortifications should have been adequately defended.,14
372,"There was a correlation between those who owed castle-guard and those who recognized the count as their liege lord, again rather less than half the total.",14
373,Thirteenth-century inquests were to see a substantial increase in this percentage.,14
374,"But if comital liegelordship (that superior bond to which all lesser allegiances must, conflict, yield) was less advanced in Champagne than in Normandy or Flanders, it completely outclassed that of any other secular or ecclesiastical lord within the county.",14
375,The therefore provides a revealing glimpse of aristocratic society in Champagne; its full potential as a source has recently been exploited by Evergates.,14
376,"Just as significantly, it betrays Henry the Liberal's view of feudalism as a clearly defined contract in which the holder of a specified fief of land performed a set amount of military service for the privilege; and, in cases where he had fiefs of several lords, had the obligation to recognize one homage as overriding.",14
377,This view — later to be the standard one among feudal lawyers — was not one which earlier counts of Champagne had embraced.,14
378,(Their own very complicated feudal position had been an inhibiting factor.),14
379,"It may be that Henry had to dispense largess to make it acceptable to his lords; but the is evidence that he had somehow overcome potential opposition, and could now capitalize on his position at the apex of the feudal pyramid in the county.",14
380,The apparently innovative character makes the fact that it was produced in the same year as the Norman inquest into knights' fees seem more than simply coincidental.,14
381,Robert of Torigny described the Norman proceedings thus:,14
382,The Norman and Champagne processes were not identical.,14
383,But they were similar enough in method and assumption to suggest possible cross-fertilization.,14
384,The new bureaucrats may well have been willing to learn lessons from their fellows across the boundaries of principalities.,14
385,"If so, they were preparing the path for the closer integration of French provinces achieved in the thirteenth century.",14
386,"Finally, a short comment on charters as sources for twelfth-century history.",14
387,The most notable fact is their proliferation everywhere across the country.,14
388,"Their chances of survival were increased by the creation of new archives — monastic cartularies became common, lay lords, notably the dukes of Burgundy and the lords of Montpellier, began to preserve their letters.",14
389,"But much more importantly, there were new incentives to have grants or judgements enshrined in writing.",14
390,"Confidence in the written word, noticeably low in the eleventh century, increased everywhere.",14
391,This reflected important social changes.,14
392,"Earlier, in a small, strongly aristocratic society, where all those likely to resort to legal process were well known to their fellows, reliance on verbal contract before witnesses had proved a sound policy, allowing for future elasticity of interpretation within clearly-defined limits.",14
393,"Now, with rising population, greater social mobility, and wider resort to legal processes, human memory ceased to be an effective guarantee of human contract.",14
394,"As Geoffrey le Bel said in the preamble to one of his charters, ‘whatever happens at one point of time will scarcely ever reach the next generation in a reliable and true account unless it is committed to writing.’",14
395,"This was particularly true for those small communities, small towns, or groups of peasants, who had won their privileges after long struggles against a higher authority.",14
396,"Without the protection of a properly sealed and attested charter, their struggles might prove vain, since it was in nobody's interest but their own that their moment of victory should be prolonged.",14
397,"There was, too, an underlying legal change: arbitration might still play a crucial part in their actual proceedings, courts gradually inclined to perceive justice as lying in precedent, or principle.",14
398,"As a result the written record of an earlier judgement given in the court, or of  a grant, could create a prima-facie case for a favourable verdict.",14
399,"In one dispute , that between Vierzon and St Florent of Saumur in 1105, the judges seem to have confined their role to inspecting the documents provided by each house, before delivering their verdict in St Florent's favour.",14
400,One factor inhibiting the spread of written documents had been fear of forgery.,14
401,"And the increasing use of charters in lawcourts naturally created an incentive to forge, as those who had lost or never enjoyed documentary proof of their rights strove to make good the deficiency.",14
402,There was little prospect of containing this.,14
403,What made it easy was that earlier charters had been produced by so many different monastic scriptoria in so many house styles that spotting the inauthentic was a task for the dedicated scholar — who in any case was more likely to be employed in propagating fraud than in hunting it out.,14
404,"But for new grants or privileges the answer, or a partial answer, lay in insistence on proper confirmation by the legitimate authority; by the second half of the twelfth century, all charters produced across the Angevin empire had to be confirmed by the Angevin chancery.",14
405,And better than mere confirmation was production.,14
406,"As princely chanceries evolved across West Francia, their output was welcomed by the population because the set formulae they employed offered some assurance of authenticity.",14
407,"Demand switched, from charters produced locally and confirmed by the attachment of a princely seal, to those written in a  name by his own clerks in his writing office.",14
408,"Under the pressure of new business, chancery clerks standardized their output, streamlined by cutting down on lengthy prologues, stated their business as succinctly as possible.",14
409,"While chanceries were adapting their wares to public needs, they were also evolving new formulae for their princes.",14
410,"Here the Anglo-Norman chancery was in the vanguard with the production of writs — commands addressed to the king-duke's officials, used in eleventh-century Normandy, but developed in the course of the twelfth into the chief instrument for central control over the localities and for legal innovation.",14
411,"With Henry II's accession to the English throne in 1154, the king-duke's  chancery operated over Western France from the Pyrenees to the Canche, and set an example to all other princes, not least to the kings of France.",14
412,Everywhere the new crisp dispositive style began to displace the older random recordings.,14
413,"From the historian's point of view, twelfth-century diplomatic makes it possible to study the legal, administrative, and political history of the period with a confidence and an ease simply lacking in earlier times.",14
414,"Because writs, charters, and other chancery letters became everyday affairs, their language was now intended to express everyday realities.",14
415,"The scribes had their eyes on the lawcourts, on the current political situation, on tangible concerns capable of exact definition.",14
416,They were assisting in the birth of government as the modem world has known it.,14
417,"As sources, their work is of crucial importance in understanding their world.",14
418,Yet its very pragmatism bears with it an inbuilt limitation.,14
419,"There was no room in their streamlined productions for that revealingly individual note — the self justification, the expression of highly personal piety — which had occasionally flashed through earlier charters.",14
420,"In growing common, twelfth-century charters also became commonplace.",14
421,FORMATIVE TRENDS IN TWELFTH-CENTURY POLITICAL LIFE,14
422,(a) The revival of royal power,14
423,"In naming his son and heir Louis (Louis = Ludovicus = Clovis), King Philip 1 had consciously aspired towards the glories of the Carolingian and Merovingian past.",14
424,"Had Louis been inclined to forget the destiny his father had mapped out for him, he would have been forcefully reminded of it in the last decade of his reign, when his chief adviser was Suger, abbot of St Denis between 1122 and 1151, a man of humble birth consumed by a passionate devotion to the cause of monarchy in the Carolingian mould.",14
425,"A letter Suger wrote for Louis's son to the bishop, chapter, and people of Beauvais began: ‘Heavenly and earthly peace from the king of kings and the king of the Franks’.",14
426,Charlemagne himself could hardly have matched this confident assumption of harmony with God's will.,14
427,"In the century inaugurated by the Investiture Conflict, Suger's greeting was doubly remarkable.",14
428,"Only the head of an ancient monastic house, confident of his standing with the Pope, would have dared to pen it.",14
429,The appointment of a Benedictine abbot as chief adviser to the king was sufficiently unusual to call to mind Benedict of Aniane's position in the early years of Louis the Pious's reign.,14
430,"Though Benedict's austerity and reforming zeal were missing in Suger, his twelfth-century counterpart, there was perhaps a similar commitment to abstract political principle, to the notion of undivided imperial or royal power.",14
431,"In Suger s case, this power was given sharper focus by its place at the apex of the terrestrial hierarchy; for, as he had learned from the presumed patron of his monastery, Pseudo-Dionysius, this was the proper ordering of earthly political authority.",14
432,"What marked Suger out from other pseudo-Dionysians was firstly, that he translated his abstractions into concepts directly  relevant to French politics in his own time, and secondly that he proclaimed his views in the influential , written in the early years of Louis VII's reign.",14
433,"As Suger saw it, the French king was feudal lord of the princes.",14
434,"In his he made William X of Aquitaine protest against Louis's meddling in the Auvergne, with the words: ‘If the count of Auvergne has committed any fault, it is my duty to present him at your court on your order, because he holds the Auvergne of me as I hold it of you.’",14
435,"Behind these words lay the belief that all offices and counties were fiefs held of the king, whether directly or through an intermediary.",14
436,Here again Suger was reasserting royal supremacy in a world which had long been deaf to such claims.,14
437,He was also prepared to grapple with the practical consequences of his view.,14
438,"Clearly it was illogical that the king, chief lord of all, should be vassal of any.",14
439,So Suger persuaded Louis to begin the task — not completed till the reign of Philip Augustus — of extricating himself from the bonds of homage which bound him to various bishops in the realm.,14
440,Historians have considered this step as an essential preliminary to the later evolution of French royal sovereignty.,14
441,"But in depriving the king of any earthly lord, Suger risked isolating him.",14
442,His solution to this problem showed his creative intelligence at work.,14
443,"As abbot of St Denis, Suger was one of France's oldest and most revered houses, whose connection with the ruling dynasty went back to Merovingian times.",14
444,It had long been the traditional burial ground of kings; all Louis's royal Capetian ancestors — with the exception of his father Philip — were buried within its confines.,14
445,"Suger devoted many years to rebuilding the great abbey church (in i style which was later to be hailed as the prototype of Gothic architecture) to make it a fit royal mausoleum, a place of worship in which mere men could obtain a brief insight into the grandeur that surrounded the king of kings in heaven.",14
446,"For Suger, the monks of his house since the late ninth century — and challenged only by the foolhardy Abelard — regarded St Denis, the apostle and martyr of the Gauls, as the author of those writings produced in fact by a sixth-century Syrian mystic, now known as Pseudo-Dionysius.",14
447,"The most famous  of these writings, that on the , provided the abbot both with his theory of the function of ecclesiastical architecture, and with a means of integrating the earthly power structure into that of heaven.",14
448,"Under the abbot's influence, Louis recognized St Denis as his patron saint — a traditional enough step.",14
449,"More surprisingly, he also saw in his patron a feudal lord.",14
450,This second relationship arose from an ingenious cover-up to a less than wholly honest piece of political self-enrichment.,14
451,"Among the lands earlier ceded to the abbey of St Denis was the Vexin français, that natural bulwark between the French royal demesne and the now hostile Norman duchy, which had been held as a Norman fief, had formed part of Simon de Crépy's state (see p. 216), and finally was reclaimed for the French crown by Philip I. The Vexin had had a comital family, in origin probably the advocates for the abbey; but Philip had bypassed their claims, granting the territory to the young prince Louis, who met with such opposition in the area that it was not until 1119 that his possession was secured.",14
452,"When Suger became abbot of St Denis in 1122, he reinterpreted the relationship between the abbey and the new count of the Vexin, to the profit of both.",14
453,"Louis became the liegeman, not of the abbey, but of its saint.",14
454,"In 1124, when the king summoned the great army to meet the threat of the Emperor Henry V's invasion, he bore the standard of St Denis at the head of his troops.",14
455,"As Suger said much later, the king recognized that he held of St Denis and that, if he were not king, he would owe the saint homage.’",14
456,Here was a new dimension in the essentially Carolingian view of kingship that Suger restored to the centre of the French political stage.,14
457,Scepticism the historical importance of this highly personal view of monarchy seems in order.,14
458,"Our dependence on Suger's as the chief source for Louis VI's reign makes his interpretation inescapable for us, as it was not for his contemporaries.",14
459,It is possible that twelfth-century laymen regarded his outpourings with an indulgent smile.,14
460,Nevertheless Suger was no cloistered academic.,14
461,"As chief adviser to Louis VI in the last decade of his reign, and as Louis VII's most trusted minister until his death in 1152, he had many  opportunities to impress his theories on princes and lords who would not dare to scoff.",14
462,"And for the crown itself, Suger's doctrine was timely.",14
463,"The ecclesiastical reform movement had drawn a new, sharp divide between temporal and spiritual, forcing all temporal authorities to redefine their self-image.",14
464,"The Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, the kings Henry I and Henry II of England, had abandoned theocracy to develop the secular potential inherent in their offices.",14
465,"The French king, with fewer resources, was reluctant to go so far.",14
466,"Suger offered the vision of divinely inspired harmony, a place for the king below the saints and martyrs of the church, with his vassals the princes on the rung below, and other lesser men in their serried ranks below again, all enveloped in St Denis's protection, fulfilling their roles on earth until they took their place in heaven.",14
467,It offended ; it preserved a whiff of the old tradition.,14
468,"As vassal of St Denis, Louis enjoyed special spiritual favour which marked him out from those whose lord was a mere mortal.",14
469,"Yet there was nothing in this relationship to gate against the susceptibilities of the reformers, for it implied no set position in the ecclesiastical hierarchy.",14
470,"Naturally the monks of St Denis, who had most to gain by it, were happy to keep Suger's tradition fresh.",14
471,They imitated him in producing histories of the Capetian kings — the earliest being Suger's successor's work on Louis VII's crusade.,14
472,Suger and Odo of Deuil between them established the norms for the house's long tradition of royal historiography; of these the chief was that whatever the Capetians did should be presented in the most favourable light possible.,14
473,"The image projected was consistently conservative; to the end of the dynasty, the kings remained the pious and holy defenders of Mother Church, the preservers of the kingdom's integrity, the faithful battlers against local tyrants.",14
474,The good press they obtained was deeply irritating to their rivals.,14
475,"Louis had another method of attracting the devotion of those to whom abstract hierarchies were mere nonsense: he touched for scrofula, as Guibert of Nogent attested in a work written before 1124.",14
476,"Many churchmen may have disapproved of the practice; but to those who flocked for  cure, it was a proof of the king's holiness, and a sign that Helgaud's miracle-worker king had not been entirely forgotten.",14
477,"But if royal charisma continued as a dominant pillar of kingship, it was now well bolstered in more mundane ways.",14
478,Royal charters bore witness to renewed vigour outside the demesne as in it.,14
479,Louis's annual average production of charters — 12.1 — was a notable increase on the 3.6 of Philip's reign.,14
480,"The new charters were likely to have been written in the royal chancery by their recipients, permitting greater uniformity, a more dispositive note, and the regular appearance of only a few royal officials as witnesses.",14
481,"At the same time, the geographical area within which royal charters were sought expanded again, particularly in the south, including the county of Toulouse, where the Capetians had never granted them before.",14
482,"Louis VII's marriage with Eleanor, duchess of Aquitaine, meant more royal charters for Poitou and Gascony; his own political endeavours resulted in an increase for Berry and the Auvergne.",14
483,"And thirdly, among the grants and privileges traditionally produced by the royal chancery, there appeared again regular records of judgements made in the royal courts, and royal letters of command,, like the English writs absent since the reign of king Eudes.",14
484,"The chancery had returned to Carolingian practices, but with an energy which outran its model.",14
485,"If Louis VI's reign was decisive for the revitalization of the chancery, his son's saw the dramatic extension of royal visitations across the realm.",14
486,"Louis VII's pretexts for visiting were many and various, but his aim was always to emphasize the specifically royal nature of his authority, to reclaim the Carolingian right of hospitality.",14
487,As was said:,14
488,"He began his reign with a splendid procession into Aquitaine as Eleanor's husband, in the course of which he arranged an inauguration ceremony for himself — either a repeat coronation for the southerners or a service to mark his accession as  duke of Aquitaine — in the city of Bordeaux, where no king had penetrated for three centuries.",14
489,"He used the opportunity to issue charters for places across the whole duchy, he rave judgements and established lasting friendships with one or two important lords from which he was later to reap benefits.",14
490,"His journey through Toulouse in 1155, on his way to Compostela, was equally unprecedented, and equally fruitful.",14
491,"Louis renewed contact with Raymond V, his brother-in-law, and met almost all the bishops of the Narbonne province; their subsequent requests for his assistance strikingly increased his authority.",14
492,"In 1173, , he issued a diploma bringing the church of Agde under royal protection.",14
493,His interventions in Burgundy were more forceful.,14
494,The royal expeditions of 1166 and 1171 were undertaken to protect Cluny and to suppress ‘schismatics’— the supporters of the imperial anti-pope Victor IV.,14
495,"They met with little armed resistance (which must have been a relief to Louis, who had little confidence in his own military skill), and gained considerable incidental profit: the king's person was seen in an area unvisited since the reign of Louis IV; the counts of Nevers, Chalon, and Mâcon were brought to heel; Burgundian lords appealed for the king's mediation in their quarrels (he also sought theirs); the count of Forez, hitherto only a vassal of the Emperor, declared his most important castles to be held as fief of the crown of France, the first step in the integration of Forez into the French realm.",14
496,All these benefits were acquired by a wily diplomacy.,14
497,Louis was perceptive enough to gauge the degree of royal influence that would be welcomed in the great principalities.,14
498,He avoided the bullying tactics his son was to employ; yet the results of his modest pursuits were in their own way as remarkable as those of Philip Augustus' domineering interventions.,14
499,To expand the circle of their was a regular objective of both Louis VI and his son.,14
500,"They recognized that a return to the Carolingian situation, in which, in theory , all free men were bound by oaths of loyalty to the crown, was an unrealistic aspiration; and they did not even succeed in asserting their lordship over all French rear-vassals, on the lines suggested by Suger.",14
501,But they did dramatically increase  the number of persons and groups of persons who recognized a bond with the crown through fidelity.,14
502,"Their most notable achievement was their insistence that, for the safety of the church, all bishops not yet under the protection of a powerful prince should enter the king's .",14
503,"As the bishops of Clermont, Le Puy, and Mende fell into this category, the Massif Central was opened to royal influence.",14
504,Then Louis VI claimed the bishopric of Arras for his patronage in 1128 — the only gain from his inglorious intervention in the Flemish succession.,14
505,"By 1180, more than half the bishops of France were again royal , with the consequence that they sought royal justice against their local oppressors.",14
506,"Closely connected with fidelity was liege homage, which the kings were equally determined to extend.",14
507,"Louis VI's reign began inauspiciously, with the refusal of some great princes to do homage, on the grounds that it was not customary.",14
508,"Though their scruples were overcome, their objection pointed to their awareness that the ceremony was changing its meaning.",14
509,"In 1106, after the death of his brother Geoffrey, Fulk of Anjou was recorded by Orderic as having received the county of Anjou from King Philip I; his homage therefore implied feudal subordination.",14
510,"In the course of the century, Louis VI and Louis VII succeeded in imposing this interpretation on all their princes' homage.",14
511,"In 1158, , Henry II swore to Louis VII:",14
512,The Angevin lands were recognized without equivocation as fiefs of the crown.,14
513,"This new precision allowed the king to capitalize on his princes' territorial consolidation: when William X took homage, both Aquitaine and Gascony were included in the contract; when Raymond V became Louis VII's man, the Rouergue, Gothia, and part of Provence joined Toulouse as fiefs of the crown of France.",14
514,Thus effortlessly the kings extended their realm.,14
515,One royal prerogative never to be revived in its full Carolingian glory was the holding of assemblies for the whole  military aristocracy of the realm.,14
516,"Ironically, this was a source of strength for the dynasty because, unlike its English counterpart, it did not have to face the potential opposition a corporate body of the great magnates could provide.",14
517,"But both kings did benefit from public gatherings of bishops and great men, largely though not exclusively from within the duchy of Francia, on the model of the assembly Philip I had called to Orléans in 1077.",14
518,"The most famous of these meetings — that held in 1155 and attended by the count of Flanders, the duke of Burgundy, the counts of Troyes and Nevers, the lords of the royal demesne — provided the occasion for Louis VII to come as close to legislating as any twelfth-century French or English king was to do.",14
519,"Here he proclaimed the Peace of God for the whole (realm — an ambiguous term, which may mean simply his demesne, or the old duchy of Francia), the twentieth canon of the Second Lateran Council (1139), and established penalties for the violation of that peace.",14
520,The princes present consented to the extension of the peace to their dominions — though not necessarily or without alteration.,14
521,"The action lacked that forceful superiority which had characterized Carolingian capitularies, in the time of Charlemagne; but it revived the tradition whereby the crown was seen as the author of society's moral norms.",14
522,A commoner function for assemblies was coordinating plans for war.,14
523,"When, in 1124, the Emperor Henry V planned an invasion, Louis summoned his nobles to Rheims to debate tactics and draw up the battle-lines.",14
524,"troops from the royal demesne and from those towns which relied on royal protection, the dukes of Burgundy and Aquitaine, the counts of Blois, Troyes, Nevers, Brittany, and Anjou, came in person with their men.",14
525,The assembly was so formidable that Henry V decided to abandon his campaign.,14
526,1124 found the French princes unusually united; assemblies to discuss wars against Normandy could never command such support.,14
527,Excuses for failures to attend abounded.,14
528,"Yet though irregular both in incidence and attendance, assemblies provided a golden opportunity for the dissemination of royal propaganda, to insist on the notion of ‘public’ war (see p. 288), and to depict royal campaigns as undertaken ‘for the  defence of the realm,’simply for the king's self-interest.",14
529,"One further return to Carolingian precedent occurred at the very end of Louis VII's reign, when coinage from the king's mints and bearing his image began to circulate outside the royal demesne for the first time since the late ninth century.",14
530,"Admittedly, its circulation in the kingdom was small, its rivals powerful.",14
531,Nevertheless it marked the first step — though only that — in the restoration of royal coinage inside West Francia.,14
532,"As judges, Louis VI and Louis VII were far more impressive when operating inside the demesne (see p. 296) than when acting, in their royal capacity, beyond its frontiers.",14
533,The difficulty was the standard feudal one of failing to get both parties to appear.,14
534,"In 1153, , when the bishop of Langres brought a complaint against Duke Eudes II of Burgundy in the royal court, all four royal summonses to the duke met with excuses; in the end, therefore, the royal verdict was given by default to the bishop, but without much expectation that a long-term solution to the conflict had been achieved.",14
535,"Still, the case was important, because Louis had summoned Eudes for a breach of the peace, the Second Lateran Council's definition.",14
536,"The crown was thus establishing its right, even before the 1155 assembly, of prosecuting violence beyond the frontiers of the demesne.",14
537,"And with lords of lower rank, the king dared more.",14
538,"As early as 1108–9, Louis VI had led a campaign into Berry to force the lord of Bourbon's submission to the judgement of the royal court.",14
539,"Where there was no breach of the peace, the kings continued to arbitrate, employing persuasion or pressure the standing of those involved.",14
540,"In the 1155 peace between King Henry II and Louis VII, it was agreed that Henry's quarrel with Thibaud of Blois should be ended by arbitration.",14
541,"To increase the chances of success, Louis offered Henry two teams of mediators; if he did not like the methods or conclusions of the first set, he could turn to the second.",14
542,"But Louis was prepared to take a much tougher line with the count of Nevers to resolve his dispute with the abbey of Vézelay: although relatives of the count were allowed to  participate in drawing up the terms of settlement, Louis insisted that, if it failed, further aggression against the abbey would be treated as aggression against the king and punished accordingly.",14
543,The dispute could not be allowed to drag on.,14
544,So the reigns of Louis VI and his son proved a decisive turning-point in the history of the French monarchy.,14
545,"After three centuries of decline, the first steps had been taken on the path to restoration.",14
546,"A royal letter to the people of Limoges c.1137 ended, ‘You know that those who despise our orders lose our favour and incur our displeasure.’",14
547,This might seem a rather feeble threat.,14
548,But the people of Limoges had been reminded that royal favour and displeasure were worthy of consideration.,14
549,"It is inevitable that the kingship of the Louis should be discussed a return to the past, for this was the way they themselves justified it: their innovations were resumptions.",14
550,Nevertheless behind the traditional concepts there lurked a marked change.,14
551,For Carolingian royal rights had applied everywhere except where a grant of immunity blocked them; but Capetian royal rights were respecters of strongly entrenched vested interests.,14
552,"On the other hand, whereas Carolingian rights had been static, therefore attrition, Capetian rights were elastic; with skilful manipulation they grew.",14
553,"An example of this can be seen in Louis VII's second Burgundian expedition, already mentioned.",14
554,"The occasion, in 1171, was a complaint by the monastery of Cluny against the count of Mâcon.",14
555,"Louis's duty to respond arose from the fact that in 1119, Cluny, caught between its need of lay protection and fear that the local lords would seek to violate its famous immunity, had turned to the distant but pious Louis VI and placed its whole order in his guardianship.",14
556,"So his son, unwillingly, was compelled to mount an expedition to discipline the count.",14
557,"The king's appearance in the Mâcunnais revived ancient memories of Louis IV's visit in 950, which his successor exploited effectively, stressing the justice of his cause and the royal obligation to suppress evil.",14
558,"Having subdued the count, Louis toured the castles, to remind castellans of the long-forgotten doctrine that fortifications were the monopoly of public authorities.",14
559,"But while reasserting the old, he also broke new  ground in the claim that he was rightful lord over all men in the area who had hitherto had no lord.",14
560,"And for good measure, he entered into an important agreement with Cluny and the bishop and chapter of Mâcon, that resulted in the creation of a royal enclave within the county.",14
561,"From this nucleus, royal territory was in the future to expand to the point at which, in 1239, the whole county could be annexed to the royal demesne.",14
562,"In an area of weak lordship, Louis was prepared to capitalize on a simple right of protection to claim an old public obligation, a new feudal lordship, and a new territorial stake.",14
563,The innovative character of Capetian kingship is unmistakable.,14
564,The same point can be illustrated from the solid profit which was derived from the expanding royal protection of bishoprics.,14
565,"On the face of it, Louis VI's claim to be lord of all bishops not already under effective protection looks a modest attempt to regain only part of the Carolingian inheritance.",14
566,"And in one sense so it was, for by 1150 almost half the bishoprics in France still escaped crown control.",14
567,But there was nothing conservative about the way in which Louis and his successor exploited the bishop of Clermont's complaints against the count of the Auvergne to secure a foothold in the county; it was their preparatory work that made possible Philip Augustus' annexation of the Auvergne to the royal demesne.,14
568,"Equally, Louis VII's intervention in the disputed election at Langres in 1138 prepared the way for his charter of 1179, taking the city and the whole episcopal fief under crown protection.",14
569,"As caries sets in at a weak point in the tooth's enamel and spreads to rot the whole tooth, so an appeal to the crown could trigger the decay of local autonomy.",14
570,A different view of royal opportunism can be seen in the confirmation of charters for leading monasteries outside the demesne.,14
571,"In 1146 Louis VII was asked to confirm the privileges enjoyed by the great abbey of La Trinité de Vendôme, under the patronage of the counts of Anjou.",14
572,"his good offices, the king inserted into the charter, after a clause designed to deter his own servants from causing depredations, a reservation of the ancient Carolingian rights of hospitality, procuration,, and which no  Capetian king had hithertofore enjoyed there.",14
573,It was a lavish .,14
574,"Less dramatic but far commoner was his habit of inserting a prohibition on religious houses trying cases of arson, rape, murder, and theft.",14
575,The motive behind this may have been the desire to assist monasteries in living canon law; for the Second Lateran Council of 1139 had forbidden churchmen to participate in (the trial of crimes punished by corporal or capital penalties).,14
576,"But if Louis's intention was high-minded, his own profit was well served; for the gap left by disappearing ecclesiastical jurisdiction was to be filled by the crown and its officers.",14
577,The extent to which Louis VI and Louis VII had consolidated royal powers was masked from their contemporaries by their policy of pushing hard only where they knew that resistance was weak.,14
578,"Therefore the greater aggression, the more systematic pursuit of self-interest which characterized the reign of Philip Augustus seemed a decisive break with earlier Capetian trends.",14
579,"Yet Philip's methods were those of his father and grandfather; and although he had a clearer notion of feudal lordship and a broader canvas on which to exploit that lordship, even here he drew on his predecessors' achievements.",14
580,"Symbolic of the change that the Louis had effected was the increasing use during the twelfth century of the term , the crown, to describe the body of royal rights to be kept intact from generation to generation.",14
581,"The impersonal and durable character of these rights was highlighted during the last years of Louis VII's reign, in the use in charters of the phrase (the crown of the kingdom), a phrase which marked out royal rights from princely by asserting their value to the kingdom as a whole.",14
582,This pretension was to be dear to the heart of Philip Augustus.,14
583,"Walter Map, reflecting on the changed character of French kingship in the twelfth century, saw the period between Louis the Pious's reign and the accession of his namesake Louis VI as one of deep depression, with 1108 marking a decisive turning-point.",14
584,Louis VI  ,14
585,There were those who might doubt the beneficial character of revived kingship; but could quarrel with Map's view that Louis was responsible for a major change of direction in the history of France.,14
586,(b) Communities,14
587,"For one school of distinguished late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century historians, led by Luchaire, the twelfth century was essentially the century of the communes — those sworn associations of burghers who, spurred by economic change, challenged with violence the feudal ordering of society, and brought about a new world.",14
588,Few would now concur wholeheartedly in the terminology or the arguments of Luchaire and his school.,14
589,"Yet they were surely correct in their fundamental premise, that what distinguished the twelfth century from its predecessors was above all the proliferation of new political communities, juridically defined by their or .",14
590,"For their appearance broadened the context of French political life, previously confined to the military aristocracy and the higher ranks of churchmen; and in the process of broadening it, changed its nature.",14
591,The roots of the new communities must clearly be sought in social and economic change.,14
592,"As the swelling rural population cleared land and settled new territory, the isolated tillers of the soil acquired new neighbours; as lords, both lay and ecclesiastical, colonized the countryside to maximize their profits, villages replaced hamlets, towns villages.",14
593,"La Rochelle, , established by a agreement between Duke William X of Aquitaine and Louis VI of France in 1130, grew in the second half of the century into the chief port for the export of Gascon wines to England; the prospect of employment attracted immigrants, the settlement became a substantial town.",14
594,And old centres expanded as rapidly as  new.,14
595,"The great abbey of Vézelay, dedicated to St Mary Magdalen, was so thronged with pilgrims in the early twelfth century that a rebuilding programme was carried out, resulting in some of the finest Romanesque sculpture to be seen in all France.",14
596,"To satisfy the needs of monks and pilgrims, the small settlement beyond the abbey walls expanded into a town, its inhabitants including innkeepers, victuallers of all sorts, mercers, and some prominent money-changers.",14
597,"Similarly the old Roman cities in Languedoc, Burgundy, and the Loire valley regained a truly urban character, after centuries of being pared down to walls, cathedral church, and market place; townsmen outnumbered clerics, new streets were built for their houses, roads inside the walls began to be levelled to prevent rubbish from blocking the entrances to new stone churches or entrance gates, trades diversified, immigrants poured in.",14
598,"In Flanders, where the cloth trade provided an urban-based industry, the transformation of small centres like Ghent, Ypres, and Lille into the greatest cities of northern Europe was startling.",14
599,"In themselves, congregations of people do not necessarily form political units; social and economic bonds may suffice.",14
600,"But the inhabitants of some twelfth-century towns and villages moved last to associate for the protection of their interests against those of their overlords — bishops in the case of most ancient towns, abbots or castellans for newer foundations.",14
601,"The most famous, and one of the earliest, associations made its appearance in Laon in the early years of the century, as a consequence of the expanding wine trade in the area.",14
602,"The merchants of Laon, irritated by servile taxes, offered a large sum of money to the ‘the clerks, the archdeacons, and the nobles’ of the town for the privilege of having a commune — a sworn association for self-protection.",14
603,"In 1112, however, the bishop Gaudry bribed the king to suppress the commune.",14
604,"Guibert of Nogent, a distinguished raconteur, was in the city on 26 April, the day on which the burghers' resentment boiled over into rebellion, and left this account of events:",14
605,"In the slaughter which followed, the bishop himself was slain.",14
606,"From the burghers' point of view, his death was a serious blow, for it forced Louis VI to punish them.",14
607,"As a consequence, it was not until 1128, and then a very substantial sum, that they obtained royal recognition for their association, now called a peace confraternity a commune.",14
608,"The charter legitimated some degree of self-government, limited the charges on serfs, guaranteed justice; it therefore formed the foundation of the town's liberties.",14
609,"Revolution was only one, and not the commonest, method pursued by burghers; taking advantage of political disturbance could bring more speedy results.",14
610,Here the classic case was that of the Flemish towns' exploitation of the succession crisis on the death of Count Charles the Good in 1127.,14
611,"We are well informed about this by Galbert, a notary of Bruges, who wrote his account of the events as they occurred, betraying a humanity and reflectiveness rare among men of his generation.",14
612,"The two most influential men in Bruges, the castellan and the dean of St Donatian's,chancellor of Flanders, were both members of a powerful new family, the Erembalds, which had risen from servile origins to prominence by the route of comital administrative service.",14
613,"Their exploitation of this recently opened path aroused jealousy among the knights, one of whom refused to answer a charge levelled against him by the Erembalds in the court of Charles the Good, on the ground that his accusers' lowly social origins barred them from comital justice.",14
614,"This allegation threatened the Erembalds' whole social and political position; so, when it appeared that Charles the Good was sympathetic towards it, they murdered him.",14
615,"Chaos followed, for Charles  had no direct heir; and several of his cousins had roughly equal claims to succeed.",14
616,"Louis VI intervened one of them, William Clito, son of Robert Curthose, and therefore a claimant also to the duchy of Normandy; for some months it looked Clito would establish his right.",14
617,"But his candidacy was naturally unacceptable to Henry I of England, who feared that the wealth and military power of Flanders would give Clito an unassailable advantage in Normandy; and the risk of antagonizing Henry was not one which the cloth towns cared to take, because they feared disruption of the wool supply.",14
618,"So, in 1125, when Clito's violation of the Ypres fair peace provided an excuse, the burghers of Ghent sent to Bruges for support in pressing the claims of Thierry of Alsace.",14
619,"Despite Louis VI's military aid, Clito died of wounds received in battle, and Thierry's claims to the county were upheld.",14
620,"The outstanding lesson to emerge from this story was that comital succession, hitherto a matter determined within the comital family, could now be affected by interests from outside, even from outside the military aristocracy as a class.",14
621,"The precocity displayed by Ypres and Ghent in securing a candidate favourable to their industrial future was not to be imitated in the rest of France in the twelfth century; still, other rulers, particularly those of Champagne, learned from it of the profit to be derived from allying with the increasingly powerful mercantile or industrial classes.",14
622,"The part the Flemish towns played in the crisis of 1127–8 not only highlighted their importance, it also guaranteed their liberties.",14
623,"For, in his endeavour to secure their support, William Clito began his reign by issuing charters to Bruges, Ghent, Aire-sur-Lys, and St Omer.",14
624,"Of these, only the St Omer charter survives.",14
625,"It included, clauses concerned with tolls and mercantile rights, a grant of freedom for the town and all dwellers in it; the abolition of the judicial duel, unpopular with merchants; the use of inquest in its place; and an enlarged competence for the or , the successors of the Carolingian , re-established in the town at the very beginning of the century.",14
626,"It was the who were to represent the towns in all the proceedings of the following year; and once Thierry of Alsace was  safely ensconced as count, he could hardly subvert their position.",14
627,"Until his successor Philip moved to establish greater uniformity in urban law, the of Bruges (and probably of other towns ) were free to fix the customary law of their own community, which implied a remarkable degree of emancipation from external control.",14
628,"In the south of France, other cities achieved as much independence by slow, steady accumulation.",14
629,"In Toulouse, , while episcopal jurisdiction shrank under the Second Lateran Council's prohibition on , the emerged before 1120 as important judicial figures, their competence enhanced by their control over the established as a consequence of the peace movement.",14
630,"The count of Toulouse, who had succeeded in uniting all areas of the town under his domination by 1119, was happy to allow the day-to-day management of the town's legal affairs, the profits of justice remained largely his, and his rights to talage, unlimited military service and forced loans at will were preserved — as they were until 1147.",14
631,"In practice, the count's absence in St Gilles and Provence allowed the gradually to accumulate powers and the town to acquire liberties, to a degree that shocked Raymond V after his return to the city in 1180.",14
632,"His attempts at resumption provoked rebellion in 1189, which facilitated the establishment of the consulate in the city, the final step towards true urban independence.",14
633,"The Flemish cities, Laon, and Toulouse were all commercial centres of more than local importance before they launched their campaigns for privileges; and if their leaders were not highly educated men at the beginning of the century — it has been suggested that the reason why weaving was concentrated in towns in Flanders was that illiterate merchants could not keep the complicated records necessary for a scattered cottage industry — then they rapidly acquired learning their corporate awareness in the course of the century.",14
634,"In 1196, the dowager countess Matilda, confirming Ghent's privileges, ensured that no barriers would obstruct any competent person who wished to open a school in the town.",14
635,The church's monopoly of formal education was broken.,14
636,"Before this was achieved, where the new town  governors' literacy proved too feeble to cope with challenges, it could be supplemented by the skills of notaries like Galbert of Bruges.",14
637,"Thus the complex administration necessary for repairing and extending city walls, channelling water supplies, ejecting waste, hearing legal cases, punishing offenders, policing the streets, could all be supplied.",14
638,"The culminating symbol of so much diverse activity was to be achieved in the thirteenth century, when the independent cities, led by those of Flanders, erected fine belfries their bells should rival those of the churches in summoning the flock to meet.",14
639,"However the movement for some degree of independence, some autonomy, was not confined to substantial towns.",14
640,It is true that the privilege of smaller towns was generally couched in more negative terms: by defining their they prevented other powers — usually castellans — from arbitrary exactions.,14
641,Yet very rapidly a list of prohibitions or limitations on the overlord's power could become a guarantee of the citizens' rights.,14
642,"In a letter to Suger, Robert of Montfalcon declared that a case over a certain man was his serf should be tried either in the royal court or before the archbishop of Bourges, the proceedings were the customs of Bourges; for him, the of his native town had assumed the status of a law binding on outside authorities.",14
643,"Bourges was a community in a vital sense, bound by rules of the inhabitants' own making.",14
644,Both Bourges and Laon were wine-growing areas.,14
645,A contributory factor in their campaigns to secure charters was that the peasants who grew the vines around the outskirts of the town found arbitrary and unpredictable seigneurial exactions an intolerable burden on a form of agriculture for which long-term planning was essential.,14
646,Rural pursuits urban required the protection that written and confirmed could bestow.,14
647,"In 1155, the customs confirmed by Louis VII for Lorris on the royal demesne established that no parishioner should have to pay taxes on food intended for his own consumption or on grain grown by his own labour; he should be exempt from tolls when he took his produce to the neighbouring towns of Etampes, Orléans, Milly, or Melun; if required for a , he must be allowed to return  home at the end of the day; the only labour service he owed his lord was in carrying seigneurial wine to Orléans twice a year; and the burgesses of Lorris as a whole were exempted from seigneurial .",14
648,"These concessions, ideally suited to promote the interests of an agricultural community, ensured widespread publicity for the customs of Lorris;, they were therefore sought and obtained by a number of other rural communities, particularly within the royal demesne, in the second half of the twelfth century.",14
649,The appearance of privileged communities was not quite as haphazard as it may seem.,14
650,"Where lordship was strong, as in Paris, the degree of self-government was strictly limited.",14
651,"The same was true in Normandy, where Henry II's concession to Rouen between 1160 and 1170, soon to be a model for other cities across the Angevin empire, permitted internal self-government by a mayor and town council, but also allowed the duke to choose the mayor from a list of three names submitted to him by the council, and protected the ducal right to military service.",14
652,"Elsewhere, the degree of urban independence varied with the amount of pressure the community could exert, its ability to exploit political crisis, and the condition of its neighbours.",14
653,"The interplay of these factors was complex; the two areas where the most advanced urban institutions were found were Flanders, where comital control was tight, and Gothia, where by contrast the count of Toulouse's authority within the great cities was almost negligible, and where the clashes between vicecomital and episcopal powers facilitated independence.",14
654,"On the lower rung of legal self-determination the grant of customary franchises might be in a lord's interests, for it could secure his revenues in perpetuity, even as it barred him the chance of arbitrary exaction; besides, an early concession might prevent more explosive demands later.",14
655,Some castellans and bishops were therefore amenable to bargaining; but others needed forceful persuasion.,14
656,"Again, where local lordship was strong, above all in Normandy, the chances of concessions were small.",14
657,"Those communities which did not receive franchises seem to have suffered a greater degree of extortion, as their lords strove to recover some of the profits they were losing elsewhere.",14
658,"As a consequence, the condition  of the peasantry in twelfth-century France varied markedly from community to community', the extremes of contrast coming between those villages on the royal demesne protected by the customs of Lorris, and those in Champagne where serfdom retained its original rigours, where peasants remained the property of their lords, their labour services heavy, their safeguards against exploitative lordship non-existent.",14
659,"On a pragmatic level, the pressure for self-government or franchise complicated the aristocracy's game of preserving their own lordship while subverting that of their rivals.",14
660,"It could offer opportunities for embarrassing independent lords, as Alphonse Jourdain of Toulouse showed when he assisted the rebellious inhabitants of Montpellier against William VI; but his own financial losses when the right to take tallage or forced loans from Toulouse escaped his grasp in 1147, outweighed any advantage elsewhere.",14
661,No lords appreciated the possibilities inherent in the movement so clearly as Louis VI and Louis VII.,14
662,"Their consummate skill in limiting demands for independence on the royal demesne, while favouring them elsewhere where a royal confirmation might create allies, has often been remarked.",14
663,But the clearest example of royal skill was found in Louis VII's cynical suppression of Vézelay's revolt against its abbot in 1152.,14
664,"The rebels, provoked by Ponce of Vézelay's unyielding determination to maintain a monopoly of justice within the town, won much self-interested support in the neighbourhood; from the bishop of Autun, who wished to subject the abbey to episcopal control, from Cluny, which hoped to reabsorb the abbey into its order, and from the count of Nevers, who resented the legalistic and literal interpretation the abbot put upon his charter of immunity.",14
665,On the other hand Ponce was strengthened in his intransigence by a papal letter forbidding him to make concessions on the immunity.,14
666,"But when his isolation rendered him vulnerable, he turned to Louis for assistance.",14
667,"As a price for his reduction of the rebels, Louis forced from the very reluctant abbot the recognition that in temporal matters he was the decision of the royal court.",14
668,"Louis's behaviour betrayed no interest in abstract justice: he was prepared to force modifications of the  immunity in his own favour, but not in those of the count of Nevers or of the rebels; moreover, his opposition to the commune was inconsistent with his behaviour at Rheims or Amiens, and with long-term royal policy (by the end of the century, Vézelay had won its liberties).",14
669,"But in the short term, the king was the only party to the dispute who benefited by it; for it allowed him to display vigorous royal action within the county of Nevers.",14
670,"For all princes, the communal movement raised a rather different problem: each privileged community, whether fully self-governing or merely franchised, constituted in enclave different rules from its neighbours; it was not therefore easily absorbed into the administrative framework of castellanies which the princes of the north were seeking to clarify and define.",14
671,"Indeed, towns were as anomalous as the independent lordships the count of Champagne was bent on integrating into his castellan network.",14
672,"Since what distinguished communities was their legal customs, anomalies could be reduced by greater legal uniformity within a whole castellany or, better still, a whole province.",14
673,"There was no problem in Normandy, where, by the middle of the twelfth century, one customary law obtained virtually throughout the duchy.",14
674,"Elsewhere in the north strong rulers, the kings, the counts of Flanders and Anjou, increased standardization by modifying customs when they confirmed them, or by persuading new communities to accept wholesale already existing customs.",14
675,"But though the patchwork of random entities slowly yielded in places to more solid blocks, nevertheless between them many separate customs survived.",14
676,"Later in the Middle Ages, the , the land of customary law, was reckoned to consist of three hundred different customs (though only sixty of these were important and there were considerable similarities across blocks).",14
677,"In the far south, Gascony, the Saintonge, Toulouse, Gothia, and the southern fringes of the Massif Central, things developed differently.",14
678,"There the eleventh-century proliferation of and castellanies had been modified by the survival (in places ) of the old administrative framework, and by the tradition that serious offences were justiciable in  a court higher than that of the castellan.",14
679,The growth of independent towns in the twelfth century lent force to the revival of public courts on the Carolingian model; while Mediterranean contacts ensured a warm welcome for the learning of Bolognese Roman lawyers in the early decades of the century.,14
680,"Although the academic study of Roman law took a long time to have practical effect, by the 1170s and 1180s it was occasionally cited authoritatively in some of the courts of the south.",14
681,"The (land written — Roman — law) was emerging, encompassing castellan and communal courts within its framework.",14
682,By this means the south was to achieve a rather greater legal  than the north.,14
683,(c) The emergence of government,14
684,What distinguishes government from personal control is its unremitting character.,14
685,To be governed is to be subjected to the regular pressure of an authority operating fixed rules.,14
686,"In the full sense of the word, it is arguable that nobody was governed before the later nineteenth century; it would certainly be foolish to maintain that either royal or princely government in the twelfth century operated fixed rules or without intermission or over all the inhabitants of a defined area.",14
687,"Nevertheless, the perception that this might be desirable was reborn, whether for good or for ill, among the twelfth-century rulers of France.",14
688,What provoked it was the ecclesiastical reform movement.,14
689,"For the reformers' vision of a fully-developed hierarchy, each man with his own sphere of competence, all canon law and all beneath the discipline of the papal rod, evoked a mixture of admiration and envy in those laymen, accustomed to deference, whose position in the ecclesiastical scheme was lower than they would have wished.",14
690,"They neither cared nor dared explicitly to challenge this picture, as the pro-imperialists among the Germans had done.",14
691,"Rather they contented themselves by pointing out that, if the secular power was now confined to the rather lowly role of protecting the church's interests with the  material sword, that sword was in practice essential to the well-being of the church.",14
692,"So Baldwin VII of Flanders, confirming the privileges of Zonnebeke abbey, declared:",14
693,It was powerful pragmatic argument.,14
694,"But it did involve the acceptance of a spiritual authority beyond his control, to which his ancestor Arnoul I could never have bowed.",14
695,And those among the princes who refused to recognize that authority — notably Duke William X of Aquitaine in the Anacletan schism — suffered a weakening of their secular power.,14
696,"In returning to the old imagery of the prince as the bearer of the sword, the reformers had in fact triggered off an important set of associations.",14
697,"They recalled the Augustinian view of political authority as established not merely for defence against external enemies, but also for internal peace.",14
698,"Thus far, French princes — with the notable exception of the Norman king-duke — had been wary of claiming for themselves the peace-keeping function within their lands.",14
699,It was no accident that Baldwin VII of Flanders moved to a new repressive interpretation of comital justice at just the same time as he claimed the superior advocacy over all ecclesiastical houses in Flanders.,14
700,"His successor Charles the Good increased his own powers of coercion to protect the weak and the tillers of the soil, while limiting those of others through prohibitions on weapon-carrying in markets or towns, and on the lighting of beacons to signal the start of a private war.",14
701,"For if the princes were to take seriously the one task the church now allowed them, they could not achieve it without also enlarging their criminal jurisdiction.",14
702,The epitaph on Geoffrey le Bel's tomb:,14
703,"As ecclesiastical reform refocused ideas on the prince's function, it also had an effect on the way he fulfilled it.",14
704,"In 1140 the monk Gratian in Bologna produced his or , in which he demonstrated that, given the proper techniques of critical examination, the authoritative statements of church fathers and ecclesiastical councils could be harmonized to yield fundamental principles of church law.",14
705,"This approach, in which lay the seeds of later scholasticism, revived the notion of truth as an objective reality, attainable in the end by human endeavour; its appeal to the optimistic humanism of the twelfth century was therefore strong.",14
706,And its implication for the conduct of trials in ecclesiastical courts was that the processes of human inquest could yield objective facts which human reason was competent to judge.,14
707,Law could become an intellectual's chess-game.,14
708,Canon law was a practice a theory well before 1140.,14
709,"Bishops in every diocese in France could be seen sorting out conflicts in ecclesiastical organization its principles; parish priests and laymen were drawn into the processes, whether as parties to disputes or as witnesses.",14
710,"For secular courts, the consequence was a revival of inquest proceedings on a much more extended scale than had been common in the eleventh century, causing a demand for documentary proof that chanceries and monastic scriptoria were hard pressed to satisfy.",14
711,"Slowly it sapped at the roots of the kind of justice which had been dependent on the judgement of God; ordeal — in any case a last resort — grew rare; though trial by battle continued as a privilege of the military classes (in some places till the end of the middle ages), it too became somewhat of a curiosity.",14
712,Oath-helpers were still employed to swear to the good character of the accused; but everywhere evidence the facts of the case grew more significant.,14
713,Self-governing towns were swift to embrace this  new — or rather revived Carolingian — form of trial; for disputes between merchants were hardly susceptible of solution by battle.,14
714,And the areas of greatest urban expansion — Flanders and Gothia — were also those where Carolingian judicial forms had survived longest.,14
715,Their example inspired others.,14
716,But inquest necessitated a professionalism long absent from castellans' courts.,14
717,"or ousted them in the self-governing towns; and slowly the day-to-day work of running courts in the non-franchised areas was taken over by knights or clerks with special knowledge of the law, leaving castellans to revert to their military role.",14
718,That this did not happen to princes was a mark of their ability.,14
719,"Thibaud V was held by John of Salisbury to be one of the most learned lawyers of his day; Philip of Alsace was a man of rare competence; other princes gathered around them their band of learned advisers, their counsellors on whose pronouncements they could depend.",14
720,"So all were seen by their subjects in their role as peace-keepers, and also as upholders and definers of customary law.",14
721,"Only where the demands of the Anglo-Norman and then the Angevin empire dictated it was there regular delegation of the prince's judicial rights to an official; even then, this delegation was revoked when the king-duke visited.",14
722,"Elsewhere, though crusading might cause a temporary break, the link between the prince and his court was close.",14
723,"When Geoffrey le Bel was unable to arbitrate in person between the seneschal and the monks of Baugé in a quarrel over tithes in 1146, he insisted that his part in the case be acknowledged.",14
724,The charter setting forth the terms of the agreement ends:.,14
725,"Princes were happy to exploit those elements in the intellectual ferment of the twelfth-century renaissance, which exalted their position as executors of justice.",14
726,Geoffrey le Bel would have been flattered by John of Marmoutier's comparison of his judicial aims with those of ancient Rome.,14
727,"The study of the classics, unfortified by specific reference to Roman law, was a potent weapon in strengthening princely jurisdiction at the expense of others.",14
728,"Equally, the theologians' new concentration on the literal meaning of the Bible produced a new view of the judge's obligations which Charles the Good of Flanders exploited for himself:",14
729,"So behind and above the person of the prince, there formed again the abstract concept of ‘the public person’, the punisher of the wrongs and injuries, the bearer of peace, the mighty distributor of justice and equity.",14
730,Yet the scholarly energy which reinvigorated abstract concepts of political function was identical with that which satirized them.,14
731,"For to believe in abstract principles of justice was to face a long series of disillusionments in everyday life, as the Goliardic poems, written by scholars trained in the new learning, amply demonstrated:",14
732,"Having raised quite unreasonably high expectations, the intellectuals were among the first to invoke God's judgement against those very processes they had so recently emancipated from God's direct intervention.",14
733,"Now, in the absence of ordeal, they could only await the final vindication of their cause in heaven.",14
734,"The roots of disillusionment — they were the fruit of twelfth-century conditions and not merely the natural response to too high or too vaguely expressed expectations — lay in the intellectuals' belief, stated by John of Salisbury.",14
735,"But princes did strive to fulfil this ideal, there were considerations which might subvert their intentions.",14
736,Thibaud IV of Champagne defended his decision to hang a criminal by asserting that he was the devil incarnate; yet the prince could not prevail against St Bernard's cry ‘I will hang this murderer myself!’,14
737,"And though for St Bernard incarceration at Cîteaux was the equivalent of perpetual crucifixion, the criminal's reception into the monastic order may not have satisfied everyone's sense of justice.",14
738,"The temperance of justice by mercy was therefore random in incidence when the criminal was not of aristocratic birth; when he was, political considerations entered into the verdict.",14
739,"For though princes might now punish delinquent vassals or officials (see pp. 360, 286), there was solid political sense in not subjecting them to the same penalties as lesser men.",14
740,"When Philip of Colombière's nephew killed the niece of the bishop of Bayeaux, King Henry II's court behaved as it would have done in the previous century in reconciling the parties by arranging a settlement between them.",14
741,"On the other hand, princes felt free to vent their own anger in ways which they now blocked to others.",14
742,"So Geoffrey le Bel, who would brook no interference with the privileges he had granted, tore up one of his own charters when its beneficiary, Gerald Bellay, had infuriated him.",14
743,A prince's treatment of his was not susceptible to rules of impersonal and eternal justice; and no attempt was yet made to make it so (see p. 349).,14
744,"Yet because a prince could now justify his coercive authority by reference to his peace-keeping function, those who failed to obtain what they saw as justice at his court, and who now stood to suffer punishment if they disturbed the peace to vindicate their rights, grew embittered.",14
745,"Gerald Bellay's rebellion against Geoffrey le Bel, with his appeal for support to Louis VII, were significant presages of future developments.",14
746,"The intellectuals' contribution to the practice of government was, in the short term, less of a mixed blessing than their political and legal theorizing.",14
747,"It lay in producing  those written documents — charters, writs, letters, accounts — by which hitherto spasmodic personal contacts between princes and their officials and subjects could be regularized, and in inventing new ways of increasing efficiency.",14
748,"The evolution of a rudimentary bureaucracy was, by 1180, the distinguishing feature of royal and princely administrations.",14
749,"Again the example of ecclesiastical organization was formative; but by 1180, lay bureaucracies had acquired a momentum and an approach all their own.",14
750,"Shortly after the middle of the century, John of Salisbury finished his famous , a discursive and unanalytical work devoted to criticizing the contemporary in the ruling circles of church and state, and to putting forward a higher code of conduct.",14
751,"Relying on the Bible, Roman law, and the classics to explain what ought to be, John also drew on his own experience to describe the contemporary scene.",14
752,"Though primarily a commentary on Henry II's government in England, the used the terms of Roman law,for ruler and , province, for the area of his rule; these suggest that John also intended his book to be relevant to France, the land in which he had been educated and to which he was to return as bishop of Chartres.",14
753,"The most famous chapter in the is that which sets forth the organic image of the commonwealth, the prince the head, the church the soul, the senate the heart, the soldiers the arms, the peasants the legs — a classical cliché brought up-to-date.",14
754,The importance of this image in the history of western political thought has long been recognized; indeed it has been hailed as the rebirth of the concept of state in the Middle Ages.,14
755,"Its most striking feature is the importance attributed to princely officials: judges and provincial governors are the eyes, ears and tongue of the body politic; officials are the hands; and financial officers the stomach and intestines.",14
756,"By the middle of the twelfth century, John's French readers would have had no difficulty in making the necessary identifications: castellans and viscounts,and , household officers, the clerks, knights, and chamberlains of princely courts abounded.",14
757,"Bureaucracy, long absent from the country, was making a rapid return, both at central and at local levels.",14
758,"And John  of Salisbury was not alone in believing that the administrative class was in dire need of instruction, lest it subvert the common good in its own or its master's interests.",14
759,The social origins of the new administrators have interested historians.,14
760,"The Erembald family, of which the chancellor of St Donatian's and the castellan of Bruges were members in 1127, was alleged by its opponents to be of servile origin; that its members chose to murder Charles the Good dispute the allegation suggests its truth.",14
761,"If this was so, their social ascent was uncommonly sharp.",14
762,But a recent study of the Capetian kings' household has traced a growing reliance on knights of lowly birth and clerks whose claim to prominence sprang solely from their usefulness.,14
763,The Cleer family in Anjou were of knightly status.,14
764,"And in Normandy, both Henry I and Henry II favoured ‘new men’, some of whom were of modest families.",14
765,How their absence of social distinction affected the performance of their duties can only be guessed.,14
766,"But it may be that, as men of little social consequence, they lacked that sensitivity to personal relationships on which the aristocratic society of the tenth and eleventh centuries had depended; for the newcomers, what was sauce for the goose was likely to be sauce for the gander.",14
767,"Because they saw the world as composed of groups of individuals, they found it easy to articulate rules of general application, to which exceptions required specific dispensation.",14
768,"But this viewpoint was liable to emerge in any case at a time in which government was extending its reach down the social scale, to affect towns, privileged communities, and even on occasion serfs.",14
769,"The schools springing up all over France in the twelfth century probably had a formative influence on the administrators, though this can rarely be proved.",14
770,"At the court of Louis VII, there was Mainier, a lawyer, whose name was prefaced by the title , meaning that he had received a , a licence to teach.",14
771,"Elsewhere, it is uncertain how many of the clerks and knights of princely households obtained from schools the pragmatic literacy on which they called in their day-to-day business.",14
772,It is rather more likely that clerks had benefit of formal education than knights.,14
773,"But courts themselves were places of education; ‘With the king of England it is school every day’, as Peter of Blois remarked.",14
774,"And literacy, in the vernacular, could certainly be acquired without the aid of schooling.",14
775,"But whether directly or indirectly, the incipient bureaucracies clearly owed much to scholastic methods, to the categorization of information, the use of abstract nouns, and the search for system, that the schools had pioneered.",14
776,"Because administrators depended on their lord's favour, they devoted themselves with vigour to Promoting his interests.",14
777,"Here lay the spur to innovation, as can be seen in the Norman and Flemish accounting systems, which combined the techniques of survey and inquest with the new arithmetic to protect and increase the revenues available to the duke of Normandy and the count of Flanders.",14
778,"The Norman exchequer (probably instituted in the early years of the century, at the same time as its English counterpart) used the tally, the chequered cloth, and the abacus to provide records for the illiterate and to overcome the considerable problems posed by the use of Roman numerals and subtraction.",14
779,These were not new expedients; but their regular and systematic application to the ends of government effected a solid gain in efficiency.,14
780,The aim of the Norman exchequer rolls was to provide a complete record of the debts and revenues due from each administrative unit of the duchy.,14
781,"The aim of the 1187 in Flanders was different: in adding all revenues and expenditures together, it offered a rough estimate of the count's total income (though in fact there were resources not mentioned in the account.)",14
782,A less exciting but equally innovative characteristic of princely officials was that they now existed in sufficient numbers to be used to check up on .,14
783,"Henry H noted threateningly at the end of a letter of command addressed to one of his : ‘If you do not do this, William of Vernone or his servants will do it; and if they do not do it, my justice shall do it.’",14
784,"Princes were within reach of achieving their ends — or some of them — without having to resort to lengthy persuasion, to bribery or to the use of force.",14
785,"Hardly surprisingly, officials were unpopular, both with sophisticated men like Walter Map and the Goliardic poets  and with ordinary peasants.",14
786,"So despite the enormous gains they conferred un their masters, they were often cheated of the loyal support they deserved.",14
787,There were few things more calculated to endear a prince to his subjects than a display of stern retribution on unjust officials.,14
788,"John of Marmoutier tells the legend that Geoffrey le Bel dressed up as a rustic and listened to complaints about his ’ rapacity; on his return to court, he paid back the sums they had extorted, and threatened them with death if they continued to defraud the peasantry.",14
789,"Though almost certainly untrue, the tale succinctly illustrates the prevailing princely ambivalence: they distanced themselves from the servants on whom they relied.",14
790,(d) Warfare and crusades,14
791,The poet Marbod of Rennes celebrated (in Latin) the vengeance which would befall a wicked castellan and his troops:,14
792,"The poem highlights two important twelfth-century developments: the use of force in punishing aristocratic crime (the fruit of princely peace-keeping), and the increasing significance of siege-engines in warfare.",14
793,"Intellectuals claimed a formative influence in the second too: John of Marmoutier declared that monks from his own monastery had read Vegetius' to Geoffrey le Bel when he was investing the castle of a rebellious castellan, and ascribed  his success to their advice on firebombs.",14
794,"But common sense may have been more important than learning in perceiving the vulnerability of most castles to — battering-rams and catapults; for even in 1100 they were, as a rule, primitive structures.",14
795,"Siege-engines demanded on the one hand skilled operators, and on the other a plentiful supply of unskilled labourers to move the necessary materials.",14
796,This effectively restricted their use to the wealthy and to those whose claim to assistance under the was incontrovertible.,14
797,"Equally, the improvements in fortification needed to withstand their effects — thick stone walls, inner outer defences — required incomes greater than those of simple lords.",14
798,"The net effect was that, given dedication, princes — Louis VI, Geoffrey le Bel, Alphonse-Jourdain — could subdue rebellious castellans within their own demesnes, and could build castles of their own which were impregnable to lengthy and sustained attack.",14
799,"Henry II's castle at Chinon, where the treasury of Anjou was situated, was the model for its generation, with its halls, upper chambers, tower, and curtain walling, set on a high point above a strategic crossing of the Loire.",14
800,"It could be copied only either by those of nearly equal wealth or by those who could concentrate their resources chiefly on defence — princes, great bishops or, in the south especially, towns.",14
801,All others became vulnerable.,14
802,John of Salisbury's comment that not only the towns but also the fortresses of Gaul feared Henry I of England was revealing of the new situation.,14
803,"Similarly, campaigning in the field imposed an increasing financial burden.",14
804,"The treaty between Robert II of Flanders and Henry I of England, renewed by their successors, stipulated that each knight supplied to the English king should bring three horses with him — this at a time when a horse represented a major investment.",14
805,Then knightly armour grew more elaborate and costly throughout the century.,14
806,"And though some knights might be supplied free by feudal service, household ones had to be maintained by their lords, mercenary ones needed pay, and those with money-fiefs constituted a regular charge on the treasury.",14
807,"Besides, their home base, knights were useless on their  own.",14
808,"In open battle and in the plundering expeditions that constituted the normal form of aggressive warfare, they needed the backing of archers, both mounted and on foot, and of numerous infantrymen.",14
809,"The usual source of supply was town militias — Suger mentions those of Rheims, Châlons, Laon, Soissons, Orléans, Etampes, and Paris in the royal army of 1124.",14
810,"But they might have to be supplemented by mercenaries from Flanders and the Low Countries, where the rapidly expanding population forced large numbers of young men into military careers.",14
811,"In the eyes of the faithful, these ‘Brabanters’, with their freebooting and lack of discipline after the end of campaigns, were as dangerous as heretics; in 1171 Frederick Barbarossa and Louis VII agreed to expel them from their lands.",14
812,"Their value in battle, as shields behind which the knights could shelter before they launched their charge, ensured their continued employment by those who could afford them — notably Henry II of England.",14
813,But the hatred they aroused meant that they were liable to be brutally slaughtered if captured afterwards.,14
814,"Inevitably, therefore, war on the grand scale as fought by princes bore little resemblance in practice to the feuds of lesser men.",14
815,"The divergence was sharpened by the application of a theoretical distinction, the fruit of Augustinian theology, amplified as the century went on by canon and Roman law reference; princes pronounced their campaigns just wars (fought against aggressors with the aim of re-establishing peace) or public wars (declared by a competent authority in the public interest), while they condemned the wars of lesser men as infractions of the peace.",14
816,"Geoffrey Martel had perceived the propaganda potential of public war as early as the mid eleventh century; later it enabled Henry the Liberal of Champagne to claim the military service of all lords within his county, a reapplication of the Carolingian .",14
817,So it could be a powerful weapon.,14
818,"Yet the logic of the definition suggested that it would benefit especially kings, whose competence to declare war could not be impugned: thus Thibaud of Blois failed to persuade the monks of Marmoutier that they owed him service when he fought against Louis VI; they claimed discretion in the matter; and in 1184, the mighty Philip of Alsace hesitated to commit to battle the army he had summoned against Philip Augustus, through fear that its ranks might melt away.",14
819,The contrast with the united front Louis VI and his troops presented to the emperor Henry V in 1124 was marked.,14
820,"A royal banner now bestowed respectability on a cause; kings' wars were assumed to be for the sake of peace, cripplingly expensive and increasingly savage.",14
821,"This goes some way to explaining why the complicated campaigns within Toulouse in the second half of the century were largely fought out under the banners of the Angevin, Aragonese, and French kings; and why the revolts of Henry II's sons had widespread ramifications.",14
822,"The twelfth century was characterized, therefore, by fewer but more protracted wars, which smouldered for long periods between short, sharp bouts of conflict, like the war that covered must of the reigns of Henry I of England and Louis VI of France, the one inaugurated by the great rebellion of 1173, which outlived both Louis VII and Henry II, or that against Catalan claims in the south.",14
823,Into these large numbers of local conflicts were subsumed.,14
824,"The pattern caused problems, the circumstances which might trigger off renewed fighting were unpredictable; yet the moment an opportunity offered, princes had to be prepared for invading their enemies; there was no time for lengthy preparation.",14
825,"The usual tactic was to march troops across the enemy's territory, plundering and looting; to take fortified places if the task was easy; to obtain allies among the lords of the locality; and to retreat without fighting a battle if possible — in effect an application to a wider canvas of the some technique of warfare which had earlier made castellans formidable in the immediate environs of their castles.",14
826,"It necessitated the rapid mobilization of auxiliaries to join a core of highly-trained troops kept constantly, at the ready — the princes' military households, which became the linch pin of the system.",14
827,"John of Marmoutier's life of Geoffrey le Bel offers a glimpse of how strong bonds were created between the prince and his followers within the household, and how a high level of training was maintained at all times.",14
828,"Geoffrey was brought up  from infancy with the sons of neighbouring Angevin lords, on whose companionship he relied.",14
829,"When it came time for him to be knighted by Henry I in Rouen, he set off for Normandy with a crowd of these young men about him.",14
830,"In Rouen, the occasion was celebrated with pomp, elaborate dress, and a great feast, and then the youths all demonstrated their military skill at a grand tournament, at which Geoffrey naturally won the highest honours.",14
831,"It was within this kind of environment that chivalry flourished, that young men learned to identify, their vassalage towards their lord as a symbol of their honour, that they debated the relative merits of Roland's and Oliver's way of displaying loyalty; and that they learned the finer points of jousting.",14
832,"Tournaments were disapproved of by ecclesiastics, for they could be both bloody and dangerous.",14
833,Yet they supplied real needs:.,14
834,that of an instruction in the martial arts compatible with the maintenance of a prince's peace; that of an outlet for competitive instincts within the claustrophobic confines of a court; and that of display to maintain princely social status.,14
835,So they flourished everywhere.,14
836,They offered opportunities for men of skill to acquire great position in the world — Arnoul of Ardres caught the eye of Countess Ida of Boulogne through his exploits; and they also conferred lustre on the great — Geoffrey le Bel and Philip of Alsace were  throughout France for their distinguished performances in these show battles.,14
837,All this formed a background to the first century of crusading; and it goes some way to explaining the more secular aspects of the magnetism which drew French knights to take up the cross in their thousands.,14
838,"Urban II, launching the First Crusade at Clermont in 1095, presented it as a natural evolution of the peace movement: warriors were to forget their petty feuds and squabbles in a campaign to promote the interests of Holy Church.",14
839,"The war, declared by one whose moral authority was unimpeachable, was to free the Eastern churches, to end Muslim guardianship of the holy places, to restore Jerusalem to its proper state.",14
840,"As princes saw it, it was a just war in the fullest sense of the term; those who were slaughtered in its battles were regarded as among the martyrs of the church.",14
841,"When Raymond of Toulouse, Robert II of Flanders, Robert Curthose, Stephen of Blois, and Hugh of Vermandois responded to the call, past and present members of their military households fell almost automatically into rank behind them, to test themselves against terrible dangers, but also to enjoy the companionship in arms, the adventure, the deeds of daring which were the stuff of the .",14
842,"That they shared, all other participants in the crusade, a fervent devotion, a conviction that their sins would be forgiven, is certain.",14
843,"Yet for them crusading necessitated no large leap of the imagination, no millenarian vision; it was simply a challenging and a deserving extension of their everyday activities.",14
844,"In French eyes, the hero of the First Crusade was Robert II of Flanders.",14
845,"While Raymond of Toulouse remained in Outremer, Stephen and Hugh disgraced themselves in escaping from the siege of Antioch, and Robert Curthose, gallant, in his lifetime failed to impress, Robert II's prestige soared to the skies.",14
846,He became Robert of Jerusalem to his contemporaries; his deeds were recorded in the ; his pious bravery totally expunged the memory of Robert the Frisian's usurpation; and after his death his son Baldwin VII harped on his father's achievement to justify his substantial use of coercion against the enemies of the church.,14
847,"Outside Flanders, Robert's sister's marriage to Roger of Sicily was a mark of his new position in the world; like Louis VI's sister's marriage to Bohemond of Antioch, it stretched French kinship connections into the new Norman colonies, ensuring that travellers from the homeland would find a welcome in those distant parts.",14
848,Robert's example was a potent one.,14
849,"After the next change in dynasty, Thierry and Philip of Alsace strengthened their shaky claim to the comital position by attaining for themselves the prestige attached to being the outstanding crusaders of their generation.",14
850,"Thierry's remote connection with the family of Godfrey de Bouillon, his marriage with Sybilla of Anjou, Fulk V's daughter, gave him some claim to the throne of Jerusalem; as a consequence, the aristocracy of Outremer viewed him and Philip with mixed feelings, expecting much of them, yet fearing their ambitions.",14
851,"In the end, it was not in Outremer but in the newly conquered  Byzantine empire that the Flemish crusading achievement was crowned with the elevation of Count Baldwin IX to the imperial throne in 1204.",14
852,"But in the twelfth century, the house of Alsace could afford the high costs of their expeditions — Thierry went to Jerusalem four times, Philip twice — and the counts' repeated absences in fact promoted administrative reform; the and the were as much the products of crusading as the English and Norman judicial system and exchequers were the product of the king-duke's divided attentions.",14
853,"But if, on balance, the Flemish counts benefited materially from crusading,— as, arguably, did the Angevin — they were typical.",14
854,For other French houses a commitment to Outremer often represented a sacrifice of domestic political interest.,14
855,"The achievements of Raymond IV St Gilles in consolidating his authority within Toulouse were threatened by his departure in 1095, especially since it was known that he had no intention of returning home.",14
856,"Then his example lured his elder son Bertrand to Tripoli in 1112, and his younger son Alphonse Jourdain there in 1147.",14
857,"Had not his grandson Raymond V fulfilled his crusading obligation in his early youth, thereby freeing himself from the necessity of interrupting his career in the county, the principality of Toulouse might have disintegrated altogether.",14
858,William IX's crusade of 1101 brought about serious financial problems in Aquitaine which caused rapid devaluation in the hitherto stable currency; and Robert Curthose's decision to mortgage Normandy to William Rufus to cover his crusading expenses exacerbated a conflict over the duchy which was not settled until the death of his son William Clito in 1128.,14
859,"All in all, it was not surprising that Suger, mulling over the precedents of early crusading, tried to dissuade Louis VII from embarking on his Jerusalem journey in 1145.",14
860,"Yet the appeal of crusading was, if anything, even stronger to those aristocratic houses just below the level of the princely: it was, after all, the house of Boulogne which produced the first two rulers of Jerusalem.",14
861,"The counts of Nevers, the lords of Montpellier, the lords of Amboise and Lusignan, the Trencavels, were fervent devotees of the ideal; so the problems of absences, shipwrecks, death abroad plagued them as much as  their princes.",14
862,"On occasion, their determination to sacrifice for Christ played directly into their overlord's hands, as when the count of La Marche, who had no direct heir, sold his county to King Henry II in 1177.",14
863,"When it did not, accompanying their princes in a joint crusading venture, as the lord of Amboise accompanied Fulk V or Hugh VI de Lusignan William IX, created new personal links.",14
864,The political spin-offs from crusading are therefore more difficult to calculate than at first glance they might appear.,14
865,Nevertheless it is clear that the chief gainer was Louis VII.,14
866,"The irony of this lay in the fact that the Second Crusade was counter-productive in Outremer, embittered relations with Byzantium, and resulted in the deaths of enormous numbers of its participants, particularly those drawn from the non-aristocratic classes.",14
867,"Yet it consolidated the king's position within France, partly through the skilled regency of Suger, but also because, in taking on himself the leadership of the expedition, Louis re-emerged as a credible ruler of men.",14
868,His noble gesture appeased those churchmen who had been appalled by his early obstinacy over the archbishopric of Bourges.,14
869,The disasters that befell his army paradoxically heightened his personal charisma: even the barons of Outremer continued to look on him as their one potential saviour.,14
870,"His friendship with Raymond V of Toulouse, a fellow warrior, reversed the trend of history since the middle of the tenth century, in bringing the princes of the far south back into the king's .",14
871,"The crowds of Burgundians who accompanied the king learned to respect him; on their return, they sought the arbitration of the royal court in their disputes, and they welcomed Louis's intervention within the counties that fringed the duchy of Burgundy.",14
872,"As William of St Denis put it,",14
873,Even as early as 1147 it was apparent that the crusading movement had provided a new sense of aristocratic cohesion  in the realm.,14
874,"The great joint expeditions, the combined leaderships, although not without friction, had been justified by their outstanding achievement, the conquest and maintenance of Jerusalem.",14
875,"They were the , the deeds of the Franks, or the , God's deeds performed through the Franks, as two of their earliest chroniclers entitled them.",14
876,But what was missing before 1147 was a clear sense of who the Franks were.,14
877,"The Second Crusade, however, was launched with St Bernard's ringing appeal to the count and barons of Brittany:",14
878,"In taking his place at the head of the Second Crusade, the decisively hastened the transformation of the Franks into the French.",14

2,Introduction,15
3,Morwenna Griffiths and Margaret Whitford,15
4,Philosophy is in urgent need of a feminist perspective.,15
5,For centuries the practice of philosophy has been overwhelmingly the prerogative of men but it is only recently that feminist analysis has made it possible to see the distorting effect of this historical fact.,15
6,The articles in this book demonstrate in a variety of ways where the bias occurs and how it might be redressed.,15
7,They also show that redressing it is a matter of importance to feminists to philosophers.,15
8,"Feminist ideas are interrelated with philosophical ideas, but most feminist writing would not be recognised as ‘philosophy’.",15
9,"Unlike most academic philosophy much of it is personal, polemical, poetical or allusive.",15
10,"Yet part of the practice of feminism is concerned with the essentially philosophical activities of redrawing concepts, reclaiming language, redefining what counts as significant or important, and, as Daly (1984) calls it, ‘naming’.",15
11,"The reconceptualisation which feminism is attempting has a direct and vital bearing on central philosophical issues, not only in political philosophy where it might have been expected, but also in epistemology, ontology, philosophy of mind, and ethics.",15
12,"At the same time, in their attempts to rearticulate these basic issues, feminists necessarily take over and use philosophical concepts already available — and in so doing they may import, entailed or entangled in apparently neutral concepts, implications which reiterate and reinforce the assumptions that are being challenged.",15
13,"This point is made explicitly by several of the contributors to this volume (see Mary Midgley, Jean Grimshaw, Joanna Hodge and Anne Seller).",15
14,Philosophy from a feminist perspective has practical implications for both philosophers and feminists.,15
15,The practice and content of Western philosophy are male-dominated and male-biased.,15
16,This statement is not directed at any one set of philosophers.,15
17,"It is true , the fact that philosophers speak with a single voice, and do not even agree among themselves about what they understand philosophy to  be, since the nature of the subject, its preoccupations and methods, is itself a matter of philosophical disagreement.",15
18,How then could philosophy be said to have a male bias?,15
19,To see this one needs to take a closer look at some of the ways in which philosophy has been conceptualised.,15
20,Western philosophy has a long tradition so it is not surprising that it has changed over the centuries both in content and in method.,15
21,"Schools and traditions, with their prescriptions about content, method or both, have risen and fallen, sometimes to rise up again in a new guise.",15
22,"Philosophers of all kinds continually look to thinkers from previous times for inspiration and argument, and schools can often be distinguished by which predecessors they read and discuss.",15
23,"Conversely, bitterly opposed schools can sometimes look to a common ancestor.",15
24,The result of all this is a web of overlapping — but different — ways of conceiving of the nature of philosophy.,15
25,"The tradition that is presently characteristic of the Englishspeaking world, including the United Kingdom, is often called ‘analytic’.",15
26,"From about 1955 to 1975 it had a particularly strong hold here in the form of ‘conceptual analysis’ or ‘linguistic philosophy’, in which it was axiomatic that any ‘empirical’question was not philosophical.",15
27,"Philosophy was held to be a ‘second-order subject’ concerned only with reason, logic and the clarification of thought.",15
28,"It could be of use to ‘first-order’, empirically based subjects, but it could learn nothing from them.",15
29,"Plainly, any questions about sex or gender are necessarily non-philosophical, if philosophy is taken to be conceptual analysis in this narrow sense.",15
30,Any attempt to introduce them into the discourse is immediately blocked by the slogan posing as question —‘but is it philosophy?’,15
31,"Philosophy that limits itself to conceptual analysis can discuss the discourses of those who talk about sex and gender, looking for conceptual coherence and the presence or absence of rational argument.",15
32,"But it cannot treat gender as a theoretical or methodological category, that might structure its own tools and methods of inquiry, and so it cannot examine its own discourse for masculine bias.",15
33,"Unless the category of gender is explicitly seen methodological importance, the question cannot even be raised.",15
34,Alternative traditions to the analytic one are mostly to be found in Continental Europe (and in some North American universities).,15
35,Montefiore and Ishiguro (1979) point out:,15
36,The universities of Europe which have not been influenced by the  analytical tradition…have represented any unitary tradition.,15
37,"The disagreements, or even lack of communication, between, , Hegelians, Marxists, phenomenologists and Thomists have often been deep.",15
38,But these disagreements are ‘small’ the barriers of mutual ignorance and distrust between the main representatives of the analytical tradition on the one hand and the main philosophical schools of the European continent on the other.,15
39,(pp. viii–ix),15
40,"These barriers have reached towering heights in the twentieth century, although information does slowly trickle through them.",15
41,It is still true to say that many Continental philosophers would hardly be recognised as such by their English-speaking contemporaries.,15
42,Montefiore and Ishiguro again:,15
43,"How unfortunate…that they have refused to read or respect , the one convinced that the other survives on undisciplined rhetoric and an irresponsible lack of rigour, the other suspecting the former of aridity, superficiality and over-subtle trivialization (Ibid., p. ix)",15
44,"Partly as a result of a slow trickle through the barriers, and partly as a result of internal inconsistencies, the analytic tradition has recently shown signs of moving from the strictly aloof position it adopted in the heyday of conceptual analysis.",15
45,"It is now possible, even in respectable academic circles in this country, to recognise that the concepts people use are related to the (changing) circumstances in which they live.",15
46,The question ‘but is it philosophy?’ is losing its power to block further discussion.,15
47,"It remains true, however, that it is still deeply contentious to suggest the possibility of points of view in philosophy, that substantial conclusions might be drawn from them.",15
48,"In this volume, the possibility of a women's point of view in philosophy is discussed directly by Paula Boddington from within the analytic tradition.",15
49,"Other contributors who are working within this tradition (Brenda Almond, Morwenna Griffiths, Mary Midgley and Anne Seller) also consider in what ways central philosophical issues might look different from a women's (or feminist) points of view.",15
50,"Other contributors, like Alison Assiter, Joanna Hodge and Margaret Whitford, have been influenced by the non-analytic  traditions of Continental Europe.",15
51,"In some ways these traditions are of especial interest to feminists since part of their history is an opposition to seventeenth- and eighteenth-century versions of the Enlightenment and the mechanistic, scientific, atomistic picture of the universe.",15
52,These are concerns shared by substantial numbers of feminists.,15
53,"However, it is clear from these three papers that the Continental traditions themselves need to be subjected to feminist scrutiny.",15
54,"These traditions are, in theory, more hospitable than the analytic one to the idea of different points of view, but in practice their point of view has been overwhelmingly male.",15
55,The feminist criticism of this volume is the more powerful because its contributors come from a variety of philosophical traditions.,15
56,it will very quickly become apparent to the reader that there are differences in their philosophical assumptions that may not be reconcilable.,15
57,Nor do they share any body of feminist dogma.,15
58,"It would be odd if they did, since feminists, like philosophers, do not speak with a single voice.",15
59,"We think it would be a mistake to try and establish any ‘consensual’ version of feminism or of feminist philosophy because we are committed to exploration of the beliefs and views we hold, even the ones which seem indisputable.",15
60,"At this point the question may well arise: since there are such profound differences among the contributors, how could these different views be said to constitute a perspective?",15
61,"And given the diversity both of contemporary philosophy and of contemporary feminism (Delmar, 1986), how could a feminist perspective in philosophy be recognised?",15
62,One suggestion is that feminist philosophy could be identified by its content.,15
63,"This is not a suggestion we agree with, but it is a popular one, especially in North America where a number of closely related discussions have emerged recently about the content of feminist philosophy, or the form a feminist critique of philosophy should take (Flax, 1983; Hartsock, 1983; Jaggar, 1983; and see also Ruth, 1981).",15
64,They include substantive conclusions about what would be different in philosophy if it were influenced by feminine by masculine assumptions.,15
65,", Flax argues that certain preoccupations are typical of masculine philosophy, and arise dilemmas deeply rooted in the masculine unconscious, resulting from childrearing practices:",15
66,Apparently insoluble dilemmas within philosophy are not the  product of the immanent structure of the human mind and/or nature but rather reflect distorted or frozen social relations.,15
67,(p. 248),15
68,Philosophy reflects the fundamental division of the world gender and a fear and devaluation of women characteristic of patriarchal attitudes.,15
69,(p. 268),15
70,"The apparently irresolvable dualisms of subject-object, mind-body, inner-outer, reason-sense, reflect this dilemma.",15
71,(pp. 269–70),15
72,Hartsock (1983) argues that for men but not for women:,15
73,The core experience to be understood is that of discontinuity and its consequences.,15
74,"As a consequence of this experience of discontinuity and aloneness, penetration of ego-boundaries, or fusion with another is experienced as violent.",15
75,"Thus, the desire for fusion with another can take the form of domination of the other.",15
76,(pp. 299–300),15
77,She argues that this perception of discontinuity and dominance has consequences for the way experience finds expression in the work of male philosophers.,15
78,"For women, in contrast, discontinuity is not the core experience, and relationships are not perceived as violent.",15
79,Jaggar (1983) sums up the position as follows: ‘The standpoint of women generates an ontology of relations and of continual process’(p. 376).,15
80,"There are serious problems with this kind of content-based assertion, as Grimshaw (1986) points out in her discussion of ‘the maleness of philosophy’.",15
81,"Firstly, it ignores those male, often misogynist, philosophers who have emphasised relations and continual processes.",15
82,She cites Hegel and Bradley as examples.,15
83,"We would also point out that the seventeenth-century scientific revolution the universe was seen, by European men, as a great chain of being, connected atomistic, necessarily related to humanity, being a ‘neutral domain of facts, of contingently correlated elements, the tracing of whose correlations will enable greater and greater manipulation and control of the world’(Taylor, 1985, p. 134).",15
84,"Secondly, it distorts the history of philosophy by assuming that it has been unchanging in its  preoccupations and conceptualisations, which it clearly has not.",15
85,"However, as Lloyd (1984) shows in her tracing of changing ideas of reason, while ideas may change, their gender inflection may remain.",15
86,"Throughout the history of Western philosophy women have been thought inferior or less than fully human, though some philosophers, like Kant and Rousseau, have found them charming and necessary to men's well-being, they keep in their place.",15
87,"Thirdly, it has a tendency to a rather static and essentialist picture of both ‘men’ and ‘women’, in this way ignoring the important and real differences between women themselves.",15
88,We do not think that any particular content in philosophy can be identified as female.,15
89,"Where we agree with the suggestions of the feminist philosophers we have just quoted is in their insistence that philosophical theory comes experience, philosophy formulated exclusively by men will reflect the experience of men.",15
90,But we also want to emphasise that neither the experiences men have nor their ideas about masculinity have remained constant.,15
91,"They have varied over history and they still vary today with race, culture and class.",15
92,"But however much they vary, the symbolic division of the world by gender appears to be a constant and fundamental way of articulating experience.",15
93,"Therefore, the experience of women will vary systematically over time, place and circumstance, in step with, but different from, the experience of men.",15
94,"As several of the contributors point out, one should be wary of reducing women's experiences (plural) to women's experience (singular).",15
95,But the division of the world by gender continues to underlie these changes.,15
96,Gender is defined by opposition.,15
97,To be masculine is not to be feminine.,15
98,Feminine is what is not masculine.,15
99,What appears on either side of the male-female divide is extremely variable.,15
100,", whether males tend to be warlike, bookish, competitive, cooperative, individualist or role-oriented is specific to time and place.",15
101,"But where masculinity is associated with any one of these, femininity will be associated with the opposite, and, where women are oppressed, taken to be inferior.",15
102,"Philosophy, it is the articulation of the concepts, dilemmas, explanations and abstractions of a culture, will only be half the story unless both genders contribute equally.",15
103,"As far as our own history is concerned, feminist criticism shows that Western philosophy has been consistently masculine in orientation even while it has changed its  preoccupations and methods.",15
104,But the other half of the story cannot be simply added on.,15
105,Grimshaw (1986) suggests:,15
106,The trouble with [a view that what is needed is a re-evaluation of the feminine]is that it still leaves uncriticised the whole association of particular qualities with the masculine and others with the feminine…,15
107,"A response to the gender inflection or masculinism of philosophical theories should involve, I think, neither merely the assertion that women too should be seen as included under or capable of whatever norms are suggested by the theory, nor merely the assertion that what is seen as feminine should be valued too, or given equal status with what is male.",15
108,"Rather, what is needed is a critique of the polarisation of masculine and feminine qualities, and a critique of the way in which such qualities may be interpreted or clustered. (pp. 47–8)",15
109,"Grimshaw emphasises that femininity or masculinity are not fixed, nor are they independent of .",15
110,We would add that to suggest giving equal status to what is currently thought to be feminine or masculine is to ignore the way in which one is defined by the other.,15
111,"In our culture to give equal status is a contradiction in terms, gender is an expression of power relations and the male continues to be the superior term.",15
112,"We are saying, , that a feminist perspective in philosophy is necessarily critical.",15
113,Like any other philosophy it is specific to its circumstances.,15
114,"It will depend on the characteristic experiences of women and men at the time of its formulation, and on the way they have entered into philosophical discourse.",15
115,Feminist criticisms and contributions need to expose and redress distortions where they are found.,15
116,"Thus, if maleness is especially associated with individualism, feminists may need to point to connectedness, but if connectedness is part of the male view, emphasising it won't be feminist.",15
117,"Intuition is now said to be ‘feminine’, and is opposed to logic (which is thereby ‘masculine’).",15
118,"But intuition used to be the favoured type of knowledge, and St Thomas Aquinas, , would never have allowed intuition to constitute a specifically feminine attribute, because it would have meant admitting that women were nearer God.",15
119,"Since the feminist perspective is necessarily critical, feminist  philosophy is not a way of articulating women's experience in parallel with men's: it is not a form of relativism.",15
120,This is a particularly important point.,15
121,That which a feminist perspective enables us to perceive is valid for everyone.,15
122,"However, since we have argued that content is not the defining criterion of feminist perspectives, we are not claiming a new objectivity or neutrality.",15
123,"We are not claiming that women on their own (or feminists on their own) have the truth, but rather that men on their own do not.",15
124,"Therefore, here again we have reservations about the position articulated by Alison Jaggar (1983) at the end of an excellent discussion of political philosophy from a feminist perspective:",15
125,"Women's subordinate status means that, unlike men, women do not have an interest in mystifying reality and so are likely to develop a clearer and more trustworthy understanding of the world.",15
126,A representation of reality from the standpoint of women is more objective and unbiased than the prevailing representations that reflect the standpoint of men.,15
127,The concept of women's standpoint also provides an interpretation of what it is for a theory to be comprehensive.,15
128,It asserts that women's social position offers them access to aspects or areas of reality that are not easily accessible to men…,15
129,"The standpoint of women reveals more of the universe, human or non-human, than the standpoint of men.",15
130,(pp. 384–5),15
131,"Though appealing and heroic, such a vision seems to claim too much.",15
132,"But although we are not arguing that women or feminists have privileged access to the truth about reality, we agree with Jaggar that the standpoint of women offers an opportunity to see what is wrong with current male-defined theories and to correct them.",15
133,"It could be objected at this point that all philosophy is critical, that all philosophical theory attempts to question, correct or overturn current orthodoxy and feminist philosophy is just philosophy, and there is nothing specifically feminist about it.",15
134,"The difference is, , that feminist criticism arises from the experience of feminism and from taking feminist theories seriously.",15
135,This would be true whatever the particular circumstances which produced the feminist response.,15
136,"The experience of becoming feminist inevitably leads to changes in one's view of oneself, and in one's view of the rest of the world.",15
137,It  is never an intellectual exercise which leaves everything the same.,15
138,"It is a discovery that changing concepts is a political activity: that it is not value-free, but is tied to the adoption of a particular interpretation of the world.",15
139,"The result is a re-evaluation of one's personal life, a re-evaluation which is often surprising and usually difficult.",15
140,Things which were previously seen as obviously true come to be seen as obviously false.,15
141,"The tensions generated by this process (and by the kinds of activity, personal and political, which accompany it) have philosophical consequences, both concerning seem problematic, and also about them.",15
142,The articles in this book explore some of these consequences.,15
143,A preoccupation common to all the papers in the book springs directly from the difficulties involved in reassessing how the ‘facts’ of one's experience correspond to the descriptions of them offered by others.,15
144,"It could be summarised by the feminist slogans, ‘the personal is political’ or ‘the politics of experience’.",15
145,"Whatever the problems with these rather global and unanalytic formulations, they do encapsulate one indispensable and basic argument of feminism, the argument that women's experience has been left out: one of the central themes of feminism has been the importance of women's experience, and one of its central enterprises has been to show how a great deal of male theorising about women has tended to deny, invalidate, or be unable to account for this experience.",15
146,"This is not to say that women's experience, perceptions, feelings and emotions are self-validating and constitute in themselves an epistemological standpoint, or even to say that they are always correctly identified and described, but it is to suggest that philosophy would look rather different if women's experience had the same rights of entry as that of men.",15
147,Most of the contributors draw attention to this point in one way or another.,15
148,", Morwenna Griffiths refers to the feminist emphasis on generating abstractions on the basis of concrete, personal experience (assuming that inherited abstractions adequately explain experience).",15
149,One of the strengths of this approach is that it becomes much more immediately apparent why certain issues are felt to be important.,15
150,"The experience of trying to force one's perceptions into preconceived categories, and the pain and distortion that this has often led to, is now used as a basis by feminist theorists for the argument that to see feeling as ‘contaminating’ objective, scientific knowledge points to a distortion of conceptualisation.",15
151,"As Jaggar (1983) points out, this is  not a simple process of incorporating the neglected experience: ‘a theory may require that we revise even the description of the world on which the theory itself is based’(p. 381).",15
152,"The contributors are not making the easy assumption that to validate their experience women do not have to put themselves into question; on the contrary, it must be recognised that to be a feminist theorist may involve some painful and hard-won putting into question of the beliefs and commitments that are the point of departure.",15
153,But the contributors all agree on the importance of that experience.,15
154,"In these papers, all kinds of non- and extra-philosophical activities become the basis for philosophical reflection, menstruation and childbirth (Brenda Almond's paper); a gut reaction to pornography (Alison Assiter's paper); the fantasies that disturb their apparently unfeminist nature Jean Grimshaw's paper); and nonviolent demonstrations against missile bases (Anne Seller's paper); the point in each case being that these experiences are the starting point, because their importance did not seem to be recognised within the theoretical categories already provided, and so urgently impel the theorist to work out categories that are more adequate.",15
155,"A second preoccupation evident in these papers is responsibility, and what could roughly be described as the ethical dimension of conceptualisation.",15
156,"Several contributors explicitly criticise the social atomist conception of human beings, defined by Mary Midgley in this volume as follows:",15
157,"This is the idea, implied by all Social Contract myths, that an individual is essentially a solitary unit, a free chooser, a being intrinsically without social ties.",15
158,"As she goes on to argue, ‘The pronoun ‘he’ is an essential part of this description.’",15
159,"Because the life-experience of women is normally so different from that of men, they are likely to conceptualise freedom, equality, rights, responsibility and autonomy, to give but a few examples, in a rather different way from men.",15
160,Thus Brenda Almond suggests that the ways in which women's lives differ from those of men are morally significant.,15
161,"In our culture women typically conceptualise themselves others; discussion of the implications of this can be found in several of the papers (Alison Assiter, Lorraine Code, Jean Grimshaw and Judith Hughes).",15
162,The result of seeing the difference in women's experiences in positive negative terms — seeing women as having something to  offer philosophy seeing them as inferior or aberrant versions of a male norm — is that the contours of familiar conceptual landscapes begin to change.,15
163,"Judith Hughes, , puts forward a way of seeing autonomy (and adulthood) based primarily on the notion of responsibility that of rationality, thus giving an ethical dimension to autonomy.",15
164,Lorraine Code argues that epistemology should not be divorced from ethics; one should be a responsible knower.,15
165,"Alison Assiter extends the notion of autonomy into the private realm where the tradition cautiously refrains from setting foot, and suggests that how we treat and are treated by other people has a direct bearing on our autonomy in the public sphere.",15
166,The ideal of an unrelated self is shown to be an ideal developed by people who have never been in the position of having primary responsibility for the care of children or the old.,15
167,"This position, actual or potential for all women, leads to a version of the self which is more likely to be and which therefore implies certain commitments or responsibilities which can hardly be denied.",15
168,"Where standard discussions of autonomy place it in the context of rights, freedom and equality, paternalism and rationality, here it is discussed questions of fantasy, how we treat others, social and personal relations, and responsibilities.",15
169,"Where standard discussions of the self talk about memory and unity, brain transplants, the rational agent acting on his beliefs and desires, or the self in its public aspect as citizen, here the self is looked at in the context of the past history of a person, unconscious or fantasy relationships with others, the importance of feelings, or the body.",15
170,"This is not simply an alternative or complementary perspective, since it raises directly the issue that what counts as a philosophical problem is itself an issue for critical inquiry.",15
171,"We have been arguing that changing concepts is a political activity; that it is not value-free, but arises a particular ethical or political interpretation of the word, and that one of the aims of the dialogue between feminism and philosophy should precisely be to reconceptualise the world that is offered by philosophy as it is .",15
172,Some feminists would expand this argument to suggest that the political and/or ethical discussion should be made an explicit part of the methodology of philosophy.,15
173,"Harding (1986) argues that since scientific knowledge (the epistemological paradigm) is in any case used for social ends, social aims should determine the formulation of scientific or epistemological problems.",15
174,"Along the same lines, Anne Seller in this volume argues for a more democratic epistemology.",15
175,"From this perspective, ethics in the broad sense (the question of relations with and responsibilities towards other people or a community) is not just a branch of philosophy but informs the conception of what philosophy is or might be.",15
176,"Contributors to this volume were given no more precise brief than the provisional subtitle ‘explorations in philosophy from a feminist perspective’, and they are working within quite different philosophical traditions and on different sorts of issues.",15
177,"However, the papers are unified by a common factor: they all draw on a body of writing and thinking — with admittedly elastic boundaries — which is not taken seriously by the mainstream as having anything to offer philosophy.",15
178,"Providing an outline of each paper in the second part of the introduction, below, we draw attention to the feminist debates which are the source for each contributor's point of departure.",15
179,In the third and final section we give a brief survey of the most well-known publications in the area of philosophy from a feminist perspective.,15
180,We hope this will be of value to both feminists and philosophers approaching these questions for the first time.,15
181,"The opening paper, by Mary Midgley, discusses the central issue of the possibility and necessity of a women's point of view.",15
182,"She addresses the tensions generated by two related dilemmas in feminist thinking, and points out why they have a wider relevance in philosophical and political thought.",15
183,The first of these tensions is about the degree of attention that needs to be paid to natural (i.e. genetically given) sex differences and similarities.,15
184,"The second, related one is about the reasons for treating all people they were the same, regardless of their individual peculiarities of sex and gender.",15
185,"She relates these concerns to the philosophical projects of finding universals of human nature, of morality and of political being, and , to the project of achieving equality between individuals of varying class, race, age and cultural background.",15
186,The questions are both political and controversial.,15
187,"As Midgley makes clear, discussions of natural sex differences can never be simply a issue, it is an one, since one still has to consider what consequences should follow from the differences one has discovered.",15
188,"Feminists began by arguing that sex differences are artificial and insignificant, for the very good reason that the idea of natural differences had so often been used to justify discriminatory treatment against women.",15
189,Midgley argues that it is time to move on  from this position.,15
190,"She sees natural sex differences as providing the basis for a critique of certain philosophical conceptions which exclude women, and in that way is enlisting them on the side of feminism.",15
191,The view that philosophical conceptions may be not so much ‘universal’ as ‘male’is discussed further in the next paper.,15
192,Brenda Almond draws on recent feminist arguments that women's distinctive perspective and experience lead them to view morality in a different light from men.,15
193,"This distinctive perspective is derived from a focus on the concrete, the abstract, and is characterised by an emphasis on responsibility on rights.",15
194,Almond suggests a number of ways in which the ancient idea that the two sexes have — or should have — different moral outlooks can be given new life in the context of modern feminism.,15
195,"She considers whether it is true to claim that there is a sex-related divergence of views, and the possible reasons for any such divergence, and goes on to suggest that there are areas in which women's views may typically differ from those of men.",15
196,", Almond questions the notion of autonomy as it has been developed since Kant, arguing that this notion is of limited value to women, since ‘the ‘masculine’ goal of moral autonomy has in practice almost always been outside a woman's grasp'.",15
197,She suggests that women's distinctive experience leads them to form a moral sensibility that is closer to aesthetic response than to the legalism implicit in much principle-based morality.,15
198,"Almond argues, like Midgley, that women's experience adds a positive and complementary contribution to our ethical conceptions.",15
199,"An ethical perspective is also present in Alison Assiter's paper, in which she argues that the Kantian or Hegelian notion of autonomy should apply to sexual relations as much as to the public world of social contract.",15
200,"She suggests that persons and their autonomy should be respected in all private and personal activities, including erotic fantasy.",15
201,The argument should be seen in the context of feminist debates about pornography and its significance.,15
202,One of the clearest discussions of these debates can be found in Elizabeth Wilson's book (1983).,15
203,"She points out that what feminist thought has done is to take pornography its usual position in the argument between conservatives and liberals over censorship, and to put it into a completely different framework (p. 137).",15
204,"For feminists, there is another context which gives the phenomenon of pornography a different meaning: the social context of violence against women.",15
205,"Pornography is seen as one manifestation among others of the way in which women are controlled by male power or violence (other manifestations are rape, or the fear of rape, wife-battering, prostitution, child-abuse, etc.",15
206,").(For further discussion see Brownmiller, 1975; Lederer, 1980; Dworkin, 1981; Griffin, 1981; and Kappeler, 1986 which are directly concerned with pornography, and Snitow .,",15
207,"1984; and Vance, 1984 on sexuality.)",15
208,"Like these writers, Assiter makes a consideration of pornography central to a consideration of women's social situation.",15
209,"She enters the feminist debate here, arguing that some feminists have misunderstood the significance of pornography, taking it to be a major cause of the oppression of women, a symptom of it, albeit a symptom which itself then contributes to that oppression.",15
210,"It is now beginning to be argued by feminists that to deal with pornography and what the phenomenon reveals, we have first to it, understand, , the meaning and function of fantasy for both men and women, and what effects it has on the rest of one's life (see Wilson, 1983 for a summary of this discussion, and also Carter, 1979; Linden 1982; Midgley and Hughes, 1983).",15
211,"For Assiter, fantasy is not just a harmless and essentially solitary activity in which everyone engages to a greater or lesser extent, but is something which also has an effect on the way people behave towards others, and on the way they may feel they can justifiably treat , particularly women.",15
212,There is thus a connection between people's private fantasies and their status as autonomous individuals.,15
213,"Drawing on a notion of autonomy which originates with Kant, and which is developed in the writings of Hegel and Marx, Assiter extends this notion and criticises the way in which it has been confined to the public sphere.",15
214,"In arguing for the relevance of the notion of autonomy in private life, she brings into question the demarcation point between private and public life which is assumed by most of the philosophical tradition she is working in.",15
215,It has been pointed out by feminists that the tradition which depends upon this demarcation line fails to give a satisfactory account of conflicts that arise in the private sphere.,15
216,"Thus two apparently unrelated discussions: the notion of autonomy the public-private distinction, and pornography, are shown here to be intimately related .4",15
217,"The notion of autonomy is discussed in a different context by Judith Hughes in the next paper which, like Assiter's, illuminates  the concept from a new angle and, like Almond's, emphasises the importance of responsibility.",15
218,"Underlying Hughes's paper are questions about how children figure in political debate, what problems the considerations about children bring to light, whether these problems have any special significance for women, and whether women's new awareness of their own political situation can be used effectively in thinking about children.",15
219,Thinking about these questions produces the conclusions that are the starting point for Hughes's paper: that the philosopher's child invariably turns out to be male and that autonomy seems to be for men only.,15
220,"These conclusions lead her to argue that rationality has been falsely assumed to be the criterion of political adulthood, and that rationality does not entail autonomy.",15
221,"Thus, analysing the attempt by political philosophers to justify the exclusion of women from public life on the grounds of their defective capacities (either rational, moral or cognitive), she suggests that there is a hidden argument which takes the exclusion of women to be unquestionable and attempts to justify the by seeking an explanation in the defective capacities that women must then be assumed to have.",15
222,"She argues that autonomy should not be seen as a psychological capacity, but as a social one, public acknowledgement, and that this acknowledgement arises from the recognition of responsibility of rationality.",15
223,"A fourth paper discussing the notion of autonomy indicates the importance of the concept for women, for whom the experience of dependence and powerlessness is often a central feature of their lives.",15
224,"Jean Grimshaw looks at some of the ways in which feminists have tried to conceptualise what it is for a woman to be autonomous, and the relationship between these conceptions and philosophical ways of thinking about the human self.",15
225,She locates her argument within both feminism and philosophical thought.,15
226,"She considers the idea, implicit in much feminist theory, of an authentic self which is said to be socially conditioned by patriarchal power, and argues that this idea owes much to a tradition in Western philosophy which dates back to the Aristotelian distinction between actions that are voluntary and actions which are coerced, a tradition that can be traced through Descartes to the present time.",15
227,"Grimshaw argues that feminists' appeal to this humanistic conception of the self as a unitary, atomistic, conscious and rational core is quite inadequate to conceptualise experiences self-deception or obsessional delusions, or the contradictions which feminists have described  between their rationally held views and political convictions on the one hand, and their emotions and desires on the other.",15
228,"to account for women's lack of autonomy it is not sufficient to think merely removing a veil, or stripping away the outer layers.",15
229,The concrete experiences of women (and men) are here used as the basis for a critique of a particular conception of the,15
230,Grimshaw suggests that Freud and psychoanalysis might offer an explanatory account of the self of considerable value.,15
231,Both feminists and contemporary philosophers in England and America have had an uneasy relationship with psychoanalytic theory.,15
232,Philosophers have been primarily preoccupied with the scientific status of psychoanalysis and whether its therapeutic claims can be substantiated.,15
233,"They have, on the whole, ignored it as a theory of mind, though a few (Richard Wollheim) have been deeply influenced.",15
234,"Feminists have been antagonistic to psychoanalysis, seeing it as a means for the social control of women, although over the last few years, the mood has shifted, and psychoanalysis is being re-examined for its possible value to feminists (see Sayers (1986) for an overview).",15
235,"In France, psychoanalysis has been taken more seriously by both feminists and philosophers, and the psychoanalytic model used as a basis for the reconceptualisation of a number of philosophical issues.",15
236,"The paper by Margaret Whitford shows how the feminist philosopher and psychoanalyst, Luce Irigaray, uses psychoanalytic theory to provide a critique of Western rationality and the traditional symbolism, which symbolises rationality as ‘male’(see Lloyd, 1984).",15
237,"Foregrounding the theme of sexual difference, Irigaray locates male-female symbolism as one of the fundamental underlying polarities of Western thought.",15
238,"Placing Irigaray's work in the context of Freudian and post-Freudian theory, Whitford suggests that Irigaray's apparently very traditional and essentialist use of symbolism has a strategic function, like that of Derrida's analyses, designed to draw attention to the underpinnings of Western metaphysics, to undermine them.",15
239,"Feminists have approached the work of Irigaray eagerly, looking for a theory which would help to understand and change the situation of women, but have been divided in their interpretations of her writing.",15
240,"Some see a romantic celebration of difference, a static, essentialising, ahistorical view of women, others find her work politically equivocal.",15
241,"Whitford's view is that Irigaray's work has been read context, and that we need to give much more careful attention to the  psychoanalytic dimension of her thought.",15
242,"Her argument is that Irigaray, as a psychoanalyst, sees psychoanalysis as a process of change as a scientific theory: Irigaray's work suggests ways in which psychoanalysis could be seen as a model for feminists seeking fundamental social change, by proposing an alternative model for the relation between the rational and the non-rational which would be more satisfactory than the dominant paradigm.",15
243,In the next paper Morwenna Griffiths also addresses the question of the relation between the rational and the non-rational.,15
244,"Drawing on the re-evaluation of emotion characteristic of contemporary feminist theory and practice, she argues that feminist conceptions of emotion constitute a critique of dualist conceptions of mind found in much Western philosophy in the English-speaking world and elsewhere.",15
245,"She refers, , to radical feminists who turn on its head the criticism that women are more emotional than men, and claim that not only are women more emotional, but that this is their strength, and that in comparison, men are enfeebled, deadened and impoverished creatures.",15
246,"As Griffiths points out, there are problems with this position, but she argues that, despite its flaws, its passionate impetus to reconceptualisation is invaluable.",15
247,"Griffiths suggests that the legacy of Descartes to the philosophical understanding of emotions has been to subsume them into one of two categories, mind or body, and to make them rational or non-rational.",15
248,"She proposes an alternative model of mind in which feelings are paid sufficient attention, and in which, through language, they are seen to be intelligent rational, non-rational or irrational.",15
249,"She argues that one's feelings are a source of knowledge being a result of understanding, and that for both social and biological reasons they are gender-related.",15
250,Thus she concludes that being male or female gives one a distinctive viewpoint which should be included in any theory of human beings.,15
251,She also endorses the radical feminist view that the well-being of private and public life depends on a better understanding of feeling.,15
252,"The legacy of Descartes comes in for further scrutiny in Joanna Hodge's paper, which examines the concept of ‘the subject’ which philosophy has inherited from Descartes.",15
253,"This concept, she suggests, has been both valuable and limiting for women.",15
254,"Valuable, in that, by providing a conception of an autonomous, rational and apparently neutral subject, it made it possible for Enlightenment liberalism (Mary Wollstonecraft) to question the  exclusion of women from public life.",15
255,"Limiting, it conceals a covert gender specificity which operates to justify women's continued exclusion — whether from public life or philosophy.",15
256,"Now, however, contemporary critiques of the notion of the subject (see, , Heideggerian phenomenology, structuralism, psychoanalysis or Derrida's deconstruction) have begun to dismantle the assumptions concealed in the notion of subjectivity.",15
257,"In her densely argued and complex paper, Hodge points out that one can distinguish between the , a notion with ontological and metaphysical commitments, and , an empiricist notion (developed, , by Hume) which retains its epistemological function while abandoning its ontological links.",15
258,"Descartes, effecting a split between rational consciousness and sensual embodiment, offered an account of the mind-body relationship which accepted the traditional hierarchy which reason governs the body or the senses.",15
259,"He saw the body in functionalist terms, but failed to make a distinction between the different functions of the male and female bodies.",15
260,"Subsequent empiricist versions avoid the Cartesian problem of the relation between mind and body by focusing instead on the epistemological processes of , but in this way obscure even further the nature of the body attached to these processes.",15
261,"However, feminism brings back to the centre of the debate the ontological issue of the different kinds of body to which the rational processes may be ‘attached’.",15
262,Feminist analysis has shown in detail that women's bodies bear cultural meanings that are quite different from those ascribed to men's bodies.,15
263,"This difference is particularly visible in the phenomenon of pornography which serves to foreground the issue of the nature of the body, an issue not discussed by Descartes and completely absent from subsequent post-Cartesian philosophy.",15
264,Hodge argues therefore that women's epistemological position cannot be exactly the same as men's.,15
265,"Like Assiter, then, Hodge suggests a link between the issue of pornography and the notion of an autonomous and rational subject.",15
266,"Her paper argues for the importance of standpoint to be taken into account in discussion of fundamentals epistemology and ontology, but also suggests that feminist political theories which assume that a conception of the subject is already available need to be complemented by more radical feminist theories (those of Daly or Irigaray) which criticise and take apart the metaphysical implications inherent in philosophical conceptions of the subject.",15
267,The epistemological issue is discussed in more detail in the following two papers.,15
268,"Firstly, Anne Seller's paper argues that the view of knowledge as a correct description of the world has only limited application.",15
269,The epistemological model of truth and falsity which applies to formal statements of propositions turns out to be difficult to apply in the context of social and political life.,15
270,"Like Hodge, Seller takes the view that women who uncritically adopt philosophical conceptions of knowledge may find themselves saddled with consequences that are at odds with their perceptions of the world and their politics.",15
271,She discusses this epistemological stances of realism and relativism.,15
272,‘Realism’ and ‘relativism’are not exact terms.,15
273,They are each used here to gesture at a range of philosophical positions.,15
274,Realists are impressed by the constraints imposed by the ‘external world’ on what we know and can know.,15
275,Seller takes realism as the view that ‘there is an objective order of reality which can be known by the human observer’.,15
276,"She discusses this the view held by some feminists that ‘every woman's experience of the world is valid, not false, illusory or mistaken, and that all views of the world are equally valid’.",15
277,She considers the strengths and weaknesses of both positions and shows how the epistemological and political questions are intertwined with .,15
278,"She argues that the main task is that of deciding what to do, and that the best way of deciding is through a genuinely democratic epistemology.",15
279,"Once this is achieved, she suggests, the dichotomy between realism and relativism becomes irrelevant; both will proceed in the same way in trying to sort out what is going on and what to do.",15
280,"Lorraine Code's paper arises a concern on the one hand with the epistemological status of experiences, and on the other, with the importance of recognising the ethical dimensions of knowing: what she terms ‘knowing well’ or ‘taking epistemic responsibility’.",15
281,"She elucidates her concept of epistemic responsibility by focusing on the practice of stereotyping, and , the stereotyping of women by men.",15
282,"The philosophical tradition she is working within is Kantian: she emphasises that human cognition is an ‘active process of and experience’, and therefore, she argues, a process that entails freedom and responsibility and the associated ethical virtues of honesty, humility and courage.",15
283,This active process is hindered for everyone if they use stereotypes.,15
284,"It is rendered particularly difficult for women who have been stereotyped, because the stereotype of  women is one which precludes the exercise of active responsibility.",15
285,The other central theme of Code's paper is the relation between experience and knowledge.,15
286,"She argues against the Kantian tradition of seeking a pure, clear objectivity in knowledge which will leave personal experience behind.",15
287,A concept of knowing well which rejects stereotyping cannot move very far from the experience which generates the knowledge.,15
288,She defines the area of feminist epistemology as that of developing theoretical accounts of knowledge which retain continuity with women's experiences.,15
289,"In a critical discussion of Carol Gilligan's work in moral development (Gilligan, 1982), she notes that Gilligan's methodological principles, the aim of listening responsively with receptiveness and humility, supply an example of the kind of approach that might fulfil this aim.",15
290,"The concluding paper, by Paula Boddington, returns to the issue of a women's point of view and what difference this might make to philosophy, leaving the reader with a kind of map of the basic issues to be explored: ‘an opening up of complexities’.",15
291,"Situating herself within the Anglo-Saxon analytic tradition, she looks at different conceptions of philosophy, its content and methods.",15
292,"Readers unfamiliar with philosophy will find her discussion of the nature of philosophy illuminating; they should be warned, though, that philosophers are likely to find it contentious.",15
293,"Including a review of material already published about women and philosophy, she distinguishes between female, feminine and feminist points of view, and then, focusing on the first of these, she considers how philosophy could or would be affected by the inclusion of more women in its institutional structures.",15
294,She looks first at how the present conceptions and practices of philosophy might admit of different points of view .,15
295,She then goes on to consider what might be changed by the inclusion of more women.,15
296,"Finally she returns to her original distinction between female, feminine and feminist, and suggests how the relation between them might have implications for possible developments in the practice of philosophy.",15
297,She concludes that women's views need to be considered and then synthesised with men's to ‘find a human whole’.,15
298,What is now known as ‘second-wave’ feminism emerged in the late sixties and seventies.,15
299,"By the early seventies, articles that saw themselves as explicitly feminist were beginning to appear in  philosophy journals (e.g. , special issue, 1973).",15
300,"As women began to cast a critical eye over the discipline of philosophy, a number of different types of work appeared.",15
301,"These can be divided, very broadly, into the following categories (although the categories clearly overlap both chronologically and conceptually).",15
302,"Firstly, there were discussions of issues thought to be of particular interest or relevance to women, abortion or equality.",15
303,"Many of these discussions are to be found in the early collections (see, , Gould and Wartofsky, 1976; English, 1977; Vetterling-Braggin, Elliston and English, 1977).",15
304,An extended discussion of this kind can be found in by Janet Radcliffe Richards (1980).,15
305,These discussions are characterised by an increasing scope and depth as the issues are accorded greater philosophical seriousness.,15
306,"Thematic collections on issues of particular concern to women continue to appear, (Elshtain, ed., 1982) or (Trebilcot, ed., 1984).",15
307,"A couple of recent collections which bring together a range of articles on a variety of topics are , edited by Mary Vetterling-Braggin (1982b) and the special issue of (1983) on ‘Women, Gender and Philosophy’.",15
308,"Secondly there was the re-examination and reinterpretation of the history of philosophy, looking at philosophers through ‘the prism of sex’ to see what they had to say about women.",15
309,"In practice, since philosophy often proceeds by paying attention to past philosophers and their ideas, the two categories overlapped to some extent with , and with a third category, political philosophy, which looks at the political philosophers the practice and experiences of feminist politics (see Okin, 1980; Elshtain, 1981; O'Brien, 1981).",15
310,"As the often misogynistic views of philosophers were exposed, two lines of approach were adopted.",15
311,"Either one could discard what the philosopher had said about women and keep the rest — which in fact often meant accepting conceptions of human nature that took the male as paradigm, and trying to demonstrate that women were as fully human as men, or one could argue that the philosopher's thought formed a system within which the attitude towards women formed an inseparable part (see Elshtain's (1981) discussion of the private-public distinction or Grimshaw (1986) for the examples of Aristotle and Kant), it was impossible just to take certain parts and leave the rest.",15
312,"The second of these choices was the one that most feminists adopted, and as a result the next decade  was marked by an increasing self-confidence feminists about their place in philosophy.",15
313,"This led to a fourth type of work which discussed the nature and limits of philosophy itself and whether there was any place for women in it, and considered whether the basic assumptions of philosophy included or excluded women.",15
314,"Here we would just like to mention briefly some of the studies that came out between 1980 and 1986, which attempt to develop accounts that would be either specifically feminist or draw upon a women's point of view.",15
315,"Under the heading of political philosophy, feminist philosophers begin by arguing with the tradition, trying to reconcile feminist insights with already existing systems of thought liberalism or Marxism, and go on to attempt to define a new perspective in philosophy.",15
316,"In (1981), Mary O'Brien rereads traditional political theory's preoccupation with the family and reproduction, and uses a revised version of  materialism developing a feminist theory.",15
317,"She argues for the view that there is such a thing as a ‘feminist perspective’ and criticises feminist theorists (de Beauvoir, Millett, Firestone and Reed) who depend too heavily on existing (male) theories.",15
318,"Jean Bethke Elshtain, in ",15
319,"(1981), looks at the way political thought has conceptualised the public-private distinction and its bearing on attitudes towards women, and critically examines contemporary feminist versions of that same distinction.",15
320,"Alison Jaggar, in (1983), looks at the relation between feminist theory and political philosophy, arguing that different feminist theories — liberal feminism, radical feminism, Marxist feminism and socialist feminism — imply different conceptions of human nature and have different implications for practice.",15
321,"A collection of essays edited by Ellen Kennedy and Susan Mendus,(1987), presents a feminist perspective on questions that have been central to political philosophy and raises questions about the philosophical underpinning of political theory.",15
322,"In ethics, there have been attempts to incorporate or develop a women's point of view, perceived as missing from mainstream theory.",15
323,"Carol Gilligan, in (1982), examines psychological theories concerning human moral development, and suggests that a male model has been developed which does not fit the experiences of  most women's lives.",15
324,"Criticising a rights-based ethics, she suggests that an alternative view of morality is needed which would include a typically feminine way of conceptualising the relationship between self and other.",15
325,"Nel Noddings describes her book,(1984), as ‘an  in practical ethics from the feminine view’ and attempts to evolve a specifically feminine form of ethics.",15
326,"A recent collection,, edited by Eva Kittay and Diana Meyers (1986) widens the discussion by bringing together different viewpoints on the issues raised by Gilligan.",15
327,"A variety of work has appeared addressing issues relating to reason, rationality and emotion.",15
328,"Carol McMillan, in (1982), argues that feminism makes the same mistake as anti-feminism in its excessive belief in rationality and empiricism, and consequently undervalues emotion, intuition and the private sphere.",15
329,"Genevieve Lloyd, in (1984), looks at the way in which Western philosophy has conceptualised reason, and shows that throughout its history ideals of reason have incorporated an exclusion of the feminine, which creates both practical and conceptual problems for women who may experience conflicts between reason and femininity.",15
330,"(This study contains a useful bibliographical essay on women and philosophy, going 1983.)",15
331,"Mary Daly, in (1984), a polemical book subtitled ‘Elemental Feminist Philosophy’ which explicitly and insistently refuses to fit the usual categories of what philosophy is supposed to consist of, argues that the passions and their relation to reason must be renamed, and thus reunderstood by women if they wish to free themselves from the constrictions inherent in the male naming of them.",15
332,"In the areas of language and epistemology, there is a collection of essays edited by Mary Vetterling-Braggin,(1982a), which usefully brings together a wide range of articles by a variety of contributors.",15
333,"Another collection, edited by Sandra Harding and Merrill Hintikka,(1983), a wide-ranging and challenging selection of essays in epistemology, metaphysics, methodology and philosophy of science, argues that it is not just content but also methodological assumptions and epistemology which show male bias.",15
334,This book draws extensively on the work of Nancy Chodorow (1978) and object-relations theory in psychoanalysis concerning the construction of male and female personality.,15
335,"A recent book by  Sandra Harding,(1986), develops the work in epistemology and philosophy of science, and examines the work of feminist theorists in this area.",15
336,"Harding shows the obstacles to, and the far-reaching consequences of, trying to construct a theory of gender as an analytic category that is relevant to the natural sciences.",15
337,Most recent work is often concerned with philosophical issues within feminism itself.,15
338,"Mary Midgely and Judith Hughes, in (1983), discuss the philosophical issues facing feminism.",15
339,"They locate the various strands in feminist thinking, and show the conceptual problems involved in combining them.",15
340,"The collection edited by Carol Gould,(1983), discusses some of the philosophical problems raised by feminism.",15
341,"Jean Grimshaw, in (1986), explores tensions in feminist thought and examines some of the philosophical problems underlying them.",15
342,"The work of French women theorists is also beginning to be translated and discussed in this country, although for French theorists, the boundaries between philosophy, literary theory and psychoanalytic theory are often fluid, their work does not always fall clearly into the familiar categories of philosophy.",15
343,"However, the work of Christine Delphy, Luce Irigaray, Julia Kristeva and Michele Le Doeuff (to name the most well known) is currently being discussed by feminists working in the area of philosophy or feminist theory.",15
344,An impressive overview of the context in which contemporary French theory is being thought is offered by Alice Jardine in (1985).,15
345,"Jane Gallop's book,(1982), is an excellent introduction to the range and implications of French feminist theory.",15
346,"A more accessible introduction can be found in Claire Duchen, whose book (1986) contains a couple of chapters discussing the central theoretical issues.",15

350,THE LURE OF THE UNIVERSAL,15
351,The long-standing philosophical controversy into which this topic most obviously fits is the political one about equality.,15
352,It concerns the degree to which human beings are standardised items.,15
353,How far are we all essentially the same?,15
354,"My main point will be that this is not a simple, package-deal question.",15
355,"There are angles from which it is important to emphasise similarities, and others from which — for equally strong moral reasons — it is important to emphasise differences.",15
356,"In the last century or two, the similarities have had more emphasis from philosophers.",15
357,This has happened partly for good political reasons because there was need to demand a more equal society.,15
358,But it has also happened for formal reasons which are not good ones .,15
359,There is a notion that philosophy ought only to deal with matters which are absolutely universal.,15
360,Now it is true that all very wide questions have a philosophical aspect.,15
361,"Philosophy, therefore, often does deal with these questions.",15
362,"But this does not mean that it is fitted only to be used on matters at the extreme end of the spectrum of abstraction — that it can, , discuss people only they are rational beings, or sets of behaviour-patterns, or immortal souls.",15
363,"Philosophy deals with conceptual difficulties, and these arise in the working quite detailed and specific ideas, of wider ones.",15
364,"Indeed, since we actually live in particular contexts and often have difficulty in understanding them, many of our mistakes arise at that level, before more abstract speculation begins .",15
365,The hasty flight to apparently universal rules often gives philosophical notions only a specious air of universality.,15
366,It is notorious that ambitious ideas claiming to mirror the whole human condition have often turned out to describe  chiefly the condition of the group doing the theorising.,15
367,"When a different set of people takes up the questions, this becomes obvious.",15
368,", errors of this kind will always be made.",15
369,We cannot jump off our own shadows.,15
370,"But after so many of these experiences, we ought to be becoming increasingly aware of the danger.",15
371,"Though we cannot look at things from all points of view , we can learn not to pretend that we are doing so.",15
372,We speak with relative confidence about our own group.,15
373,"But to see what limitations this brings, we absolutely need to have a more lively sense of its differences from the groups which neighbour it.",15
374,A gradient of dissimilarity leads each of us.,15
375,"Yet this, we all need to communicate and to get some general understanding of and of the world we live in.",15
376,Total scepticism about this project is not an option for us.,15
377,We therefore continually try to correct one philosophical perspective about it against another.,15
378,"Among these corrections, feminist ones have resoundingly made good their place.",15
379,"Earlier generations had already noticed the odd consequences which followed from Aristotle's having seen the human condition as unquestionably that of an Athenian gentleman, and Kant's having seen it as that of a Prussian bourgeois.",15
380,"But until lately very few people had managed to make themselves heard when they pointed out the dramatic effect of all previous philosophers having seen it as that of a man — , , not an exact reflection of what men are like, but an image of how they tend to see themselves when they contrast themselves with women.",15
381,How much does this particular limitation matter?,15
382,"Till lately, respectable intellectual opinion has held that it hardly mattered .",15
383,From the ancient hierarchical point of view (unchanged from Aristotle to Kant and beyond) it could not matter because women themselves did not really matter.,15
384,"They were in effect an inferior kind of man, with no distinctive character of their own.",15
385,"They thus shared in the human condition to the extent that inferior men did, and needed no special comment.",15
386,"On the other hand, those who abandoned the hierarchical position and held, not only that all men were equal but that all people were so, lost interest in sex differences for the opposite reason.",15
387,"For them, women were as good as men because they were no different from men.",15
388,They were effectively men but inferior ones.,15
389,The move is that which Aristotle or Kant would have made if they had promoted all outsiders (women and non-European peoples) to the status of honorary Athenian or Prussian men.,15
390,Now from certain points of view — mainly political ones — this is an admirable move.,15
391,"For the purpose of asking whether a given set of people may be enslaved, or deprived of their property, or denied access to the law courts, or the like, decency is best served by remembering that these are beings as conscious and valuable as ourselves, sharing our vulnerabilities and sensibilities.",15
392,So we call them equal.,15
393,"But there is a whole range of other situations where the opposite move is needed, where we need to stress that people can differ from us, over proposals to give all children the same kind of education or to make everybody live in the same kind of house.",15
394,"Notoriously, long and gruelling work is needed to make the notion of political equality fit both these kinds of demand.",15
395,"To date, feminism has contributed a good deal of fuel to both sides of this dialectic, because the case of women is a peculiar one, and introduces even more complications into an already troublesome argument.",15
396,"The main need, however, is to bring the two sides somehow together, since all of us at one time or another need help from both of them.",15
397,I think feminists have not seen this need clearly enough.,15
398,"They have been too ready to use one or other of the clashing theses as occasion served, without troubling to bring them into intelligible relation.",15
399,"This has happened naturally enough, because it reflects the habits of those with whom they were disputing.",15
400,"Reformers attacking the subordinate status of women have naturally appealed to the idea of equality, because it was already recognised as a proper and powerful tool of reform.",15
401,"But in other situations — in asserting a mother's special right not to be deprived of her children, or in offering characteristically female insights to correct a narrowly male view of life — they have equally naturally appealed to the idea of a distinct female nature.",15
402,"Quite sharp conflicts continually develop between these two approaches, and will continue to do so until their relation is thought out properly.",15
403,Is difference eventually to be abolished?,15
404,"Should the dialectic process ideally lead to a simple merging, the views of men and women on any matter will normally be indistinguishable?",15
405,"Or is the position more like that of the interaction between two separate cultures — or indeed two individuals — where each can indeed gain from the other, but will always retain its own distinct identity?",15
406,"AUTONOMY, SOLITUDE AND EGOISM",15
407,An interesting and crucial example of this difficulty concerns the ‘social atomism’ typical of Enlightenment thinking.,15
408,"This is the idea, implied by all Social Contract myths, than an individual is essentially a solitary unit, a free chooser, a being intrinsically without social ties.",15
409,"This unit can become bound to others only by his own free choice, and his choice is rational only he can safely expect it to serve his own interests.",15
410,The pronoun ‘he’ is an essential part of this description.,15
411,"If ‘she’ is substituted, the ludicrous unreality of the picture becomes plain.",15
412,The great Social-Contract theorists of the Enlightenment therefore explicitly excluded women from their systems.,15
413,"Each woman remained attached to some male contractor, the older organic and hierarchical pattern.’",15
414,"The resulting brand of individualism thus contains a radical anomaly, affecting half of those present — an anomaly which, however, does not seem to have been visible until light was specially directed it by feminists.",15
415,(This little bit of extra enlightenment is a key move in the creation of modern feminism.),15
416,There are two possible ways of curing the anomaly.,15
417,"One is to go the whole atomist hog and turn women too into full-time contracting egoists, no less exploitative and solitary than the males.",15
418,"Rousseau (1755), in his early accounts of the state of nature, attempted this heroic move, and he has recently been echoed from the feminist side by Shulamith Firestone in (1971).",15
419,"As a response to the brutal competitive individualism which is fashionable today, this proposal is understandable.",15
420,"If the rest of us cannot beat the gangsters, we may well be tempted to join them.",15
421,But efforts to work out this atomistic society in detail are not very plausible.,15
422,", the situation of children both in Rousseau's world and in Shulamith Firestone's is a more or less impossible one.",15
423,This is not just a matter of children's physical dependence; it concerns the emotional constitution of human beings generally.,15
424,The asocial attitude which these pictures call for is not one normal to human beings of either sex.,15
425,The only situation in which it tends to look so is the transient one of adolescents leaving home and protesting against their parents.,15
426,Even Nietzsche expected his future Supermen to form a community.,15
427,Why then has the atomistic image been so powerful?,15
428,"Why has it been extended so far beyond the large-scale political contexts where it was needed, to permeate  modern ideas about choice and freedom?",15
429,"Why, when we all know that loneliness is a paralysing form of human misery, do we go on we thought that the deepest need of rational individuals was to be independent of ?",15
430,Traditional thinking answered these questions by saying simply that such was the true nature of man.,15
431,And it often explicitly contrasted that nature with that of woman.,15
432,It is no accident that both the Greek and Latin words for ‘virtue’ originally meant ‘maleness’.,15
433,"Much morality, and thereby much metaphysics, has been distorted by serving a polemical purpose in a clash of ideals seen as dividing the two sexes.",15
434,"Theorists have constantly and explicitly used antitheses active/passive, reason/emotion, form/matter, mind body, autonomy/dependence as weapons in this supposed war, recommending their own ideals by directly claiming that the contrary ones were typical of women.",15
435,The call to ‘be a man’ has regularly been seen as a self-explanatory moral exhortation.,15
436,"In this way, grossly oversimple notions about sex differences have affected philosophy far beyond the obvious context of egalitarian theory from which we started.",15
437,False claims to universality have been used to cover a persistent warping in our notions of what it is to be an individual.,15
438,"Once we have seen it, can we get rid of this distortion quite easily?",15
439,"We can certainly make some progress towards doing so by peeling away the gender-drama from the conflicts of ideals in which it has often figured, and trying to see those conflicts in sex-neutral terms.",15
440,"Freedom, we now notice, is not always a higher ideal than those with which it competes, nor is rationality necessarily just a matter of self-interest.",15
441,"Certain social bonds are essential for the highest activities that we are capable of, the antithesis ‘bond or free’ was always a tendentious one.",15
442,.,15
443,Can we then go on from there to a new unbiased universality?,15
444,"Have we reached down to the true bedrock of human life, at which sex differences are revealed as artificial and insignificant, we need a tribal division?",15
445,"On this point, feminist thinking is — as I have mentioned — highly ambivalent.",15
446,"The egalitarian strand of it says yes, and dismisses all suggestions of genuine, irreducible sex differences as ‘sexist’.",15
447,"Another and equally powerful strand says no, because it wants to emphasise the distinctive value of women's insights, and also the special bond of sisterhood which is seen as binding women together, letting them be absorbed and assimilated into  he wider human group.",15
448,"For both these purposes, it is inconvenient to regard the existing distinctive qualities of women — whatever these may be — as simply deformations produced by oppression, which could be expected to evaporate when that artificial pressure is removed.",15
449,Those who stress sisterhood equality value in women's distinctive approach as it now is (and has been in societies much less egalitarian than ours) and do not want it lost in the melting-pot of assimilation.,15
450,Deeper thinking can resolve this clash.,15
451,"But until it does, constant confusion arises from trying to combine the two approaches.",15
452,This (again) is not just a problem for feminism.,15
453,"It indicates much wider unfinished business in our long task of digesting Enlightenment ideas — of working out the proper relations between such large concepts as nature, freedom, equality, justice, individuality and the human affections.",15
454,"By ceasing to ignore the awkward case of women — as most of the traditional theorists did we can often see what has gone wrong with our thinking in other, apparently more straightforward cases.",15
455,THE USELESSNESS OF STANDARDISING,15
456,One point which should help us to start here is already familiar from existing discussions of equality.,15
457,Political equality does not call for standardisation.,15
458,Political equals do not have to be  in any respect.,15
459,They do not even have to be alike beyond some minimum range of conditions which puts them into the same political category.,15
460,"This range varies for different purposes, but the aim is always to make it as wide as possible.",15
461,"Thus, for basic civic rights like not being enslaved or imprisoned without trial, people should need only to be people.",15
462,"For slightly more demanding purposes like voting or serving on juries, they need also some minimum level of maturity and sanity, because here their actions affect the interests of others, so they need to understand what they are doing.",15
463,"For more demanding purposes still more is required, and it is often hard to decide just where to fix the borderline.",15
464,But what the ideal of equality never demands is likeness in any respect above this minimum.,15
465,"its quantitative sound, political equality never means having an equal amount of any chosen characteristic.",15
466,"It does indeed enshrine a quantitative metaphor, because it exists to counter an older picture which used one.",15
467,"This was the archaic  picture of a king ten times as large as a noble, a noble ten times as large as a merchant — down to the almost imperceptible peasant woman.",15
468,"Against this notion, the reformers contended that, in Bentham's words, ‘each should count for one and nobody for one’.",15
469,"But there does not seem to be any useful way of developing this idea by seeing people as containing equal quantities of any special substance, or equal degrees of any property.",15
470,"Imaginatively, however, negative moves of this kind have to be completed by devising new pictures to replace the old ones.",15
471,"To replace hierarchal pictures, the Enlightenment used many such images, and they often did tend to suggest some deeper kind of standardisation as the basis of equality.",15
472,Thus when Burns wrote:,15
473,"The rank is but the guinea stamp, The man's the gold for a' that",15
474,"he vigorously used an ancient notion of personal worth as resting in an original standard substance, and variation as introduced by society.",15
475,How ancient this thought is we can see by noticing that it is just the figure Plato used in to supply his political myth justifying political (Bk.,15
476,"III, 414–15).",15
477,"The hereditary caste of Guardians must (Plato says) be believed to be originally golden while the other castes are of various baser metals, and the various metals ought not to be mixed together.",15
478,Therefore — an occasional mutated child which turns out to be plainly of the wrong metal for its caste — ranks must remain separate.,15
479,"Burns triumphantly hijacks this image by extending the golden substance to the borders of manhood —‘a man's a man for a’ that', one could properly ask for ‘one man, one vote’.",15
480,"Women, however, were still perceived as being made of a different metal and, Mill, their voting remained an absurd and scandalous project for many decades after ‘manhood suffrage’ became a reality.",15
481,And indeed the otherwise democratic Swiss are still of Burns's mind in this matter; their women do not vote.,15
482,People who are denied political privileges like this on the ground that they are not standard items naturally tend to reply that the charge is false — to claim that they are actually just as standard as everybody else.,15
483,"When political conflicts rage, it is far harder to take on the awkward task of asking why this particular standard was set up in the first place.",15
484,"In class warfare, , oppressed people easily find themselves claiming to be just as noble or gentlemanly as  their supposed betters, without properly criticising existing ideas of nobility or gentility.",15
485,"(Burns avoided this move, which is what gives his protest its particular dignity.",15
486,) Aspiring castes can easily be led in this way to inherit actual faults from their predecessors.,15
487,"More subtly and widely, they can be led to waste effort in imitating traits which had a point in the situations which gave rise to them, but become empty and even harmful when transplanted.",15
488,The Victorian middle class seems to have become entangled in a good deal of bad faith of this kind by its attempts to imitate an aristocratic life which it did not fully understand.,15
489,The pursuit of standardisation — the failure to value a difference — here goes beyond a mere passing mistake and becomes actively pernicious.,15
490,"There will be similar trouble over the gender difference if indeed as I am suggesting — it is true that ideas about the meaning of maleness have distorted moral thinking in our culture quite deeply, to affect the whole concept of individuality, and thereby condition the way in which some central metaphysical issues are seen.",15
491,"(If this is right , it is, , right to some extent for other cultures too, but that must be left aside for now.)",15
492,"If, therefore, women want to storm the citadel and share its existing treasures, they have to decide what to do about these autonomy-centred ways of thinking.",15
493,"Are they satisfactory, genuinely universal conceptual systems, which everybody in the new, gender-free intellectual cosmos can use with perfect comfort?",15
494,"Or are they biased, faulty and badly revision?",15
495,The first option is Shulamith Firestone's.,15
496,"It is, I think, the logical conclusion of the line in Enlightenment thought which has run from Rousseau through Nietzsche and Sartre — the strand of truly anarchic individualist thinking which avoids the vulgar Nozickian ‘libertarian’ path of concentrating on the freedom of certain selected institutions commercial companies, and genuinely exalts only the freedom of the individual.",15
497,Anyone who finds that this entire detachment from personal ties really is their highest ideal will be happy with this kind of utopia.,15
498,"Shulamith Firestone undoubtedly did everyone a great service by vigorously extending this notion to women, and pointing out the absurdity of men's viewing themselves as totally detached individuals the rest of society, while still expecting to go home to a wife who would always have their dinner hot for them in the evening.",15
499,"But once this absurdity is made clear, many of us today will probably find that extreme individualism, when thus exposed in its full aridity, is not a  heritage that we want to claim.",15
500,And that leaves us with the second alternative.,15
501,We have to do the more general piece of work involved in clearing one more bias from our morality.,15
502,We have to look at the take its slot the unquestioned ideal ‘be a man’.,15
503,"We must examine it to see what sense it can yield us in the case of those who, as it happens, are not men in the first place, and in what way, once this is done, it will have changed its meaning for those who, by no special fault or merit of their own, actually are so.",15
504,DIFFERENCE IS NOT INFERIORITY,15
505,"As the title of this paper shows, I am sure that we cannot hope to do this rethinking while still clinging to the currently orthodox view that there are no natural, genetically determined sex differences.",15
506,"This orthodox view does not really rest on factual evidence, though such evidence is sometimes brought in to back it.",15
507,(There is no hypothesis which cannot find some facts to support it.),15
508,It is held because people believe the acceptance of natural sex differences to be dangerous.,15
509,"The danger has been a real one, but it has flowed entirely from distorted views about what the differences are, not from acceptance of difference as such.",15
510,"Different does not mean worse or better, it means different.",15
511,"And in fact the greater the difference is, the less easy does it become to dismiss one of the differing parties as a mere inadequate version of the other.",15
512,"This is clearly enough seen in the case of differing individuals, and also in that of differing cultures.",15
513,And the case of the sexes is on the same footing.,15
514,The main reason why difference is harmless has already been mentioned.,15
515,Equality does not mean standardisation.,15
516,One can be ‘as good as’ somebody else in all kinds of ways while still being very different from them.,15
517,"This may sound obvious, but it is extremely hard to remember.",15
518,"Life is constantly astonishing us by confronting us with new kinds of character, and thereby with different kinds of goodness.",15
519,"Thus Anne Elliott in astonished at her friend Mrs Smith's cheerful acceptance of misfortune and hardship,",15
520,watched — observed — reflected and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude and resignation only.,15
521,"— A submissive  spirit might be patient, a strong understanding would supply resolution, but here was something more; here was that elasticity of mind, that disposition to be comforted, that power of turning readily from evil to good, and of finding employment which carried her herself, which was from Nature alone.",15
522,It was the choicest gift of Heaven.,15
523,"(vol. 2, ch. 5)",15
524,Failure to be ready for this kind of thing is the main cause of our dismissing whole squadrons of our fellow-creatures as uninteresting or inferior.,15
525,This was Aristotle's mistake over women.,15
526,"Judging them by the standard which he used for men, in a society where their roles were totally different, he naturally did not think much of them.",15
527,"So far, what I say may not sound too shocking.",15
528,"Moral pluralism, the notion that there are different kinds of goodness, is quite acceptable to modern thought.",15
529,"What worries people is the idea that these differences, however valuable, are in any way naturally determined and therefore the control of the individual.",15
530,"In the case of personal differences, how much does that matter?",15
531,"It is true that I cannot become you, you cannot become me and Blake could not be Beethoven.",15
532,But this is not an infringement of our freedom.,15
533,"As theologians have noticed, it is not clear that even God could become somebody himself.",15
534,The power to become absolutely anybody goes beyond any normal notion of omnipotence; why should it be a necessary part of freedom?,15
535,The idea of freedom which lies behind this kind of demand is confused in the same way as the idea of equality which calls for standardisation.,15
536,"Both universalise prematurely, hardening and expanding one aspect of the moral situation to cover ground that goes far beyond its relevance.",15
537,Does this point lose its edge if we think of the differences as socially naturally produced?,15
538,This too is a strange idea.,15
539,", it is true that much of the individuality which people show has been the result of their upbringing.",15
540,Nobody who brings forward biological causes supposes that they replace social causes.,15
541,"They merely supplement them, as the original qualities of food supplement the effects of cooking in accounting for the properties of the finished dish.",15
542,"But this fact cannot save the inflated concept of freedom just mentioned, because people's upbringing is normally just as far their control as their genetic constitution is.",15
543,What is called ‘biological determinism’ is not more of an attack on freedom than the social determinism (or economic determinism) which is  accepted without moral qualms throughout the social sciences.,15
544,"What is injurious is not determinism but fatalism — , the pretence that bad things which are in fact within our control lie outside it and are incurable.",15
545,"On any view of causes, in the life of each of us is completely our power, and our freedom must consist in the way we handle that small but crucial area which does actually come before us for choice.",15
546,"This situation is far more benign than people obsessed with freedom make it sound, because what comes to us by no choice of our own is a gift — a whole world which we could not possibly have made and at which, all its horrors, we can on the whole only bow our heads in wonder.",15
547,"Moralists able only to think of autonomy, of the active imposition of the will on what is round us, miss the essential values of receptivity, of contemplation, of openness to the splendours of what is not oneself.",15
548,"Our inheritance, both social and natural, is not a shocking intrusion on our privacy and freedom, but a realm for us to live in.",15
549,"Morally speaking, one of the worst aspects of the autonomy-centred Enlightenment attitude has been to denigrate the receptive virtues, to make us so obsessed with giving that we do not know how to receive.",15
550,", one of these aspects of life does not make much sense without the other.",15
551,"About individual differences, much of what I am saying here may not sound too bad, but many people will want to treat sex differences quite otherwise.",15
552,"Here, the history of the various disputes has been important.",15
553,Modern educational theory has strongly promoted the idea that individual differences are intrinsic and must not be ironed out.,15
554,We have been told for several centuries every child is naturally different and it is therefore wrong to impose on one the mould which has been prepared for others unlike it.,15
555,"This important thought has been constantly at odds with the equally influential notion that we are all blank paper at birth, ready to be entirely formed by our society.",15
556,This last wild exaggeration has also been popular with educators at times when they wanted to stress the importance of their task and the need to get it right.,15
557,"But the quite opposed notion of innate individuality has also maintained its strength, because there is so much in the experience of anybody who actually works with children to support it.",15
558,"If the little creatures were really blank paper at birth, nobody would ever have the slightest difficulty in writing on them whatever their particular culture required, and it would be  impossible for them ever to surprise their elders by unexpected conduct.",15
559,"This is so far from the truth that on the whole, for those really attending to education, the notion of innate given individuality has remained the stronger.",15
560,"Sex differences, however, have been put into a different box.",15
561,"By bad luck, the question of women's emancipation has been most often seen as parallel to that of non-European races.",15
562,"And race difference is, among all the differences which have been used to justify oppression, probably the most trivial.",15
563,"Where it does not coincide with cultural frontiers, it is insignificant.",15
564,"In this case, therefore, Burns's idea of treating differences of status built on it as idle and artificial is just as appropriate as it is in the case of class.",15
565,"It cannot follow, however, that this is true of all other differences.",15
566,"Burns's image of the gold is, we should notice, bound to the Blank Paper theory of human difference.",15
567,Gold can be made into all sorts of other things besides guineas.,15
568,Is the gingerbread which is currently stamped into men equally capable of being stamped into standard unisex persons?,15
569,"If we are tempted to assume so, it may be worth while looking at yet another parallel to balance the highly peculiar one of race.",15
570,How about age?,15
571,This certainly has a biological basis a social one.,15
572,The physiological states of growing organisms including human beings — vary greatly from one stage to another.,15
573,Typical behaviour patterns also change.,15
574,"Play, sleep, sexual behaviour and other proceedings are differently distributed typically — at different ages, in a way that broadly holds across cultural barriers.",15
575,What reason would there be to deny the obvious causal connections with changing physique?,15
576,"‘Ageism’ is objectionable, not because it means admitting these connections, but because it means treating old people — or children — badly.",15
577,"There is nothing fishy about simply admitting the reality of the difference, or that of the physical causes which — alongside cultural ones — help to produce it.",15
578,"To insist on denying the reality of such causes is to draw a bizarrely hard line between the physical and the mental aspects of a human being — a line which does seem sometimes to be drawn in the social sciences, and may prove handy in academic feuds between them and biology, but which seems very badly suited to the realistic description of our lives.",15
579,I have carefully said nothing here about the details of particular natural sex differences.,15
580,The general point about the innocuousness of natural difference as such needs to be grasped on its own.,15
581,"Once seen, it gives us back a legitimate access to a great wealth of  traditional human experience on the matter, which must be critically used, but which certainly does not leave us utterly puzzled, as we might be in starting to observe a strange species.",15
582,Feminists have already made good use of this tradition.,15
583,"I think, however, that their use of it is still often confused and inhibited by mistaken ideas about what equality demands, and that the senseless ideal of standardisation still produces a waste of effort on this topic, as on many others.",15
584,This is the sort of muddle which often causes good ideas to run out into the sand.,15
585,I particularly do not want this to happen to feminism; hence my choice of subject for this essay.,15
586,3,15
587,Women's Right: Reflections on Ethics and Gender,15
588,Brenda Almond,15
589,"There is a view that is as old, probably, as the human race, and certainly as old as Homer and the ancient Greeks, that there is one ethical structure that represents right for men: a composite of manly virtues, courage, endurance, physical stamina, wiliness and political judgement, and a corresponding but complementary conception of what is right for women, womanly virtue being seen as a mixture of timidity, tenderness, compliance, docility, softness, innocence and domestic competence.",15
590,"Views about the exact composition of virtue, male and female, have changed over time, and they may vary, too, with differing social and geographical contexts, but the underlying theme is constant: the theme, , of difference.",15
591,"It is recognisable it appears in feminist dress, as it does, , in these remarks of Hester Eisenstein (1984): ‘I argue that feminist theory has moved from an emphasis on the elimination of gender difference to a celebration of that difference as a source of moral values.",15
592,"A woman-centered analysis presupposes the centrality, normality, and value of women's experience and women's culture’(p. xviii).",15
593,"Clearly, a distinctively feminist conception of women's moral values will differ significantly from traditional stereotypes.",15
594,"But it is worth asking, nevertheless, whether the old and the new might not be rooted in the same set of facts.",15
595,"Any discussion of ethics and gender, then, must involve some reference to facts.",15
596,But the primary question is not one about facts .,15
597,It is about moral ideals.,15
598,"Should we — women and men — be aiming at a common ethical conception, a shared moral perspective?",15
599,Or should we — women alone — be working to rewrite the map of morality to promote a separate moral perspective?,15
600,"Must we, in other words, accept an ultimate sexual apartheid as far as ethical values are concerned?",15
601,"The larger question, then, is not about what is, but about what  to be.",15
602,"But since answering this question involves reference to some matters of fact, it is necessary to say something about those facts.",15
603,"Essentially, they are of two kinds.",15
604,"First, there are facts about what different people's moral ideals actually are.",15
605,"Here it is important to know (a) whether male and female ideals diverge: whether, , the moral outlook people have depends in some causally related way on whether they are male or female, and (b) whether the ideals themselves are gender-relative: , whether what is good in a woman or right for a woman might not be bad in a man, or wrong for a man, and .",15
606,"Secondly, there are facts about the lives of men and women and the systematic ways in which their lives differ, which it would be unwise to overlook.",15
607,"A systematic difference in the life-experience of women and men can have ethical implications both in a different moral ideal making women differently about morality from the way men think about it — and also in a different moral ideal justifying, , a genuinely alternative moral perspective.",15
608,"These last points may seem to imply a flagrant disregard of the well-known difficulty, first pointed out by the philosopher David Hume in the (1739), of reasoning from ‘is’ to ‘ought’(Selby-Bigge ed., 1952, pp. 469–70).",15
609,But no transgression against Hume's stricture is involved in pointing out that people's about what ought to be — their moral stance and outlook — may be directly related to certain distinctive features of their lives.,15
610,"And no transgression, either, is involved in accepting that moral views and ideals must take account of, and be responsive to, facts.",15
611,"Ideals are not formed in an aseptic vacuum, but in the chemical brew of interacting personal lives and events.",15
612,So let me begin by making some impressionistic guesses about the views women do in fact currently hold on morality.,15
613,"I can do this best a personal anecdote, which might be called the Incident of the Taxman and the Philosopher.",15
614,"Discussing the case of a headmaster who had reported his pupils to the police for criminal behaviour, the Philosopher, who was female, expressed the opinion that, since the headmaster is , he should have tried to avoid resort to law; he should have dealt with his pupils himself, privately and without publicity — as would, she suggested, a loving parent.",15
615,"The Taxman expressed moral outrage at such a suggestion, declared that this was not his conception of the implications of being , and said that he, as a parent and husband, would have no hesitation in reporting  the criminal actions of his child or indeed his wife, particularly if he saw no sign of either remorse or an intention to reform.",15
616,He added that apprentice-Taxmen are coached in the matter of the known duplicity of women and their willingness to lie to protect members of their family.,15
617,"At this point, the Taxman's wife expressed moral outrage at the discovery that her husband would, without compunction, report her misdeeds, or those of her daughter, to the authorities, and the Philosopher was left with a sense of having stumbled upon a set of basic moral presumptions which are held by one sex, and entirely inverted in the case of the other — a looking-glass reversal of priorities and values.",15
618,"As it happens, , this conclusion conforms to the observations of Freud, who believed that women had less sense of justice than men and are more often influenced in their judgements by feelings of affection or hostility.",15
619,"It conforms, too, to some more recent observations of Piaget, Kohlberg and Gilligan.",15
620,"Lawrence Kohlberg's empirical work on moral development follows, as far as its basic stance is concerned, the structure and assumptions of Jean Piaget, who has demonstrated apparently invariant sequences of change, not only in relation to moral development, but in other areas, too.",15
621,"The underlying assumption is that there is a necessary maturation of cognitive processes, just as there is of physical and motor processes.",15
622,"Just as every normal human child first learns to crawl, then to stand and then to walk and the motivation and capacity to do these things comes from within the child, and is not artificially imposed from outside — so, the moral development theorists hold, there is a necessary sequence of stages of emerging moral judgement.",15
623,"Their empirical research is directed to establishing what these stages are, and to describing the circumstances surrounding the transitions.",15
624,Kohlberg's stages of moral development are usually described as a progression from lower to higher — itself an inbuilt and unrecognised value-judgement.,15
625,"The early or lower stages that he has identified are first, a stage in which children's thinking is rooted in obedience to adults, fear of punishment and acceptance of authority; then a stage of an essentially self-interested acceptance, for the sake of reciprocity, of a principle of fairness between peers; and then a further stage of seeking approval and desiring to be well thought of by one's community or group.",15
626,"Later comes a stage of respect for justice: recognition of the importance of for community living, followed by an awareness  of the of some of these rules and their embodiment in principles of individual human rights applying across varying cultures and societies.",15
627,Kohlberg has speculated on the existence of a seventh stage in which the universal human perspective is replaced by a holistic cosmic perspective which might have a religious or even a pantheistic orientation.,15
628,"All this is framed in gender-neutral terms, but researchers have become aware of difficulties in finding women who can be placed by this classification in the ‘higher stages’ of moral development.",15
629,Women's answers to the questionnaires by which assignments to ‘stages’ are made show them to be more heavily represented in the early stages of development the later.,15
630,Women desire to please.,15
631,"Women rebel against impersonal principles of morality which, when rigorously applied, ignore individual pleas for sympathetic concessions, for mercy justice.",15
632,"Carol Gilligan's research, which focused on the distinctively female moral dilemma of an abortion-decision, suggested that what was emerging here was not a moral of women but a ‘different voice’ on morality.",15
633,"The findings of the male researchers, she claims, are dogged by what she calls the problem of women ‘whose sexuality remains more diffuse, whose perception of self is so much more tenaciously embedded in relationships with others and whose moral dilemmas hold them in a mode of judgment that is insistently contextual’.",15
634,"While she concedes the broad outline of the developmental model — a model which proceeds from an egocentric through a societal to a universal perspective — she sees this development as taking place, in the case of women, within a special moral conception.",15
635,The nature of this moral conception is recognised by a distinctive use of a particular vocabulary: a vocabulary of selfishness and responsibility; or morality as an obligation to exercise care and avoid hurt.,15
636,"The particular sequence of moral development revealed by Gilligan's research is described by her in this way: first, as in Kohlberg's findings, a stage of focus on the self; then, a second level of development in which the notion of responsibility is used to balance the claims of self against the claims of other people; this stage brings a notion of the good as caring for others; it involves a protective care for the dependent and unequal.",15
637,"It is succeeded by a third stage at which the tension between conformity and care, selfishness and responsibility, is dissipated by a self which, in Gilligan's words ‘becomes the arbiter of an independent judgment  that now subsumes both conventions and individual needs under the moral principle of non-violence’(Gilligan, 1977, p. 492).",15
638,Gilligan sees this as a morality of responsibility that stands the morality of rights underlying Kohlberg's conception.,15
639,"In it, a positive conception of caring contrasts with the purely negative policy of non-interference suggested by an emphasis on rights.",15
640,"What is missing from the latter, and its omission is deliberate accidental, is the detail and texture that comes with knowledge of particular people and particular circumstances.",15
641,Kohlberg's research is based on questionnaires which demand a response to hypothetical and imaginary situations in which concrete detail is necessarily omitted.,15
642,Gilligan points out that Kohlberg thus divests his moral actors of the history and psychology of their individual lives.,15
643,"Many women, confronted by Kohlbergian questionnaires, ask for, or contribute their own imagination, concrete detail which might help them resolve the moral dilemma with which they are presented.",15
644,They are told that this sort of question or embellishment is inappropriate.,15
645,Kohlberg's dilemmas are not about real people — they can't be if the aim of the research is to discover objective principles of justice.,15
646,Gilligan mentions here the anonymous woman whose nonlegalistic thinking enabled Solomon to display his legendary wisdom.,15
647,She contrasts that woman's sacrifice of self and principle for the life of her child with the willingness of Abraham to sacrifice his son for principle and personal integrity.,15
648,What both of these examples demonstrate is the concreteness and particularity of real life situations.,15
649,It is interesting to compare Gilligan's criticisms of Kohlberg on this point with Robert Nozick's parallel and equally cogent criticisms of Rawls.,15
650,"John Rawls, in A seeks to arrive at abstract principles of justice a device which strips the procedure of arriving at principles bare of all reference to the particular and concrete.",15
651,"His principles are chosen by people behind a hypothetical ‘veil of ignorance’, where they know nothing of their social position in society, their sex, race, abilities or conceptions of the good (Rawls, 1972, pt.",15
652,"I, ch. 3).",15
653,"Nozick points out that the very nature of Rawls's thought-experiments guarantees the of principles that will be chosen: that they will be impersonal and grounded in future-oriented principles of distribution, being personal and grounded in current or past circumstances (Nozick, 1974, pt.",15
654,"II, ch. 7).",15
655,"To accept Nozick's criticism  is not to judge Nozick's conception of justice against Rawls, any more than acceptance of Gilligan's argument involves rejection of Kohlberg's abstract principles of justice.",15
656,"It is simply to recognise that the structure of the ‘proof’ in both cases, in Rawls's case an proof, in Kohlberg's case an experimental one, actually presupposes what it sets out to establish.",15
657,"The outcome is guaranteed before the procedure, whether logical or empirical, is embarked upon.",15
658,"But Gilligan does not, in fact, reject the notion of a rights-based morality.",15
659,"Instead, she argues that the feminine strand should to an enlarged and revised universal conception of morality, in which the ideals of compassion and care are added to the more impersonal ideals of autonomous judgement and action.",15
660,"She believes, then, that a morality of rights can be integrated with a morality of responsibilities — that the two conceptions are essentially complementary.",15
661,This coincides with the views of some other feminist writers who have been impressed by this distinctively ‘female’ contribution to morality.,15
662,"Hester Eisenstein, , looks forward to women transforming the world in the image of what she calls ‘the woman-centered values at the core of feminism’.",15
663,"This means, she believes,",15
664,"associating feminism with the liberating traditions of Western thought, from Locke and Rousseau to Marx and Engels, tending in the direction of greater equality, shared decision-making and justice.",15
665,"But it means, too, transforming these traditions, by imbuing them with the woman-centered values of nurturance and intimacy, as necessary and legitimate goals of political life.",15
666,"(Eisenstein, 1984, pp. 144 5)",15
667,"Reflecting on the same contrast, Carol McMillan refers to Hegel's view of the family as an inferior organisation to the state because it is based on love.",15
668,"She points out that much of a woman's life is based on a spontaneity of moral response that many philosophers, Hegel and Kant, would say had no moral worth (McMillan, 1982).",15
669,The idea that acts of love are inferior to principled acts is a deep-rooted philosophical tradition.,15
670,"This area of love, care and spontaneous response which ignores, or deliberately flouts, principle and convention is one, then, where an initial impressionistic guess about male and female differences can be given an impressive weight of support.",15
671,"There is a second  impressionist guess, however, which it is harder to document.",15
672,This is the extent to which women's moral perceptions are tied to the aesthetic.,15
673,"The link between awareness of beauty and recognition of the moral good was a fundamental aspect of Plato's ethical theory, but few writers since Plato have tied awareness of beauty in nature so closely to a deeper notion of the good.",15
674,"However, it is a striking observation that women's moral sensibilities are, more often than men's, triggered by an awareness which is essentially aesthetic.",15
675,"The following account is given by Helen Weinreich-Haste of a response to a question designed, not to explore this point, but simply to discover more about significant changing points in people's lives:",15
676,I was driving on my way through beautiful scenery in Wales where I live and it suddenly occurred to me how this would all be altered in a nuclear war.,15
677,And it just stopped me dead in my tracks.,15
678,I couldn't keep driving.,15
679,I had to stop and I felt really physically very unwell.,15
680,And I was crying.,15
681,I sat for about three quarters of an hour before I could continue the journey.,15
682,"(quoted in Weinreich-Haste, 1987)",15
683,The woman who gave this account thereafter changed her established way of life to become an activist in the Greenham Common protest against the siting there of cruise missiles.,15
684,"To cite a personal response of a comparable nature, I find in myself an apparently irrational extra revulsion at the occurrence of bombings or murders that take place in beautiful places on beautiful days.",15
685,"It would be absurd to approve of such events taking place on grey, sunless days in dark, depressing places.",15
686,"Nevertheless, there is a sense of incongruity and inappropriateness about an ugly act which involves the destruction of what was, in some wider and more general sense, previously beautiful.",15
687,"But this, even more than the previous example, is not, , an attitude to women.",15
688,"It must be something of the sentiment that inspired the war poets, enduring indescribable ugliness — the mutilation and destruction of people and places amongst the fragile flowers that nature silently but abundantly proffered in the stench, decay and squalor of the trenches.",15
689,"The sentiment was expressed many times over, but it is succinctly put in the following lines by R. E. Vernede, who was killed in action in 1917:",15
690,"The sun's a red ball in the oak And all the grass is grey with dew, A while ago a blackbird spoke He didn't know the world's askew…",15
691,Strange that this bird sits there and sings While we must only sit and plan Who are so much the higher things — The murder of our fellow man…,15
692,"Or, as Edmund Blunden put it:",15
693,"Bold great daisies' golden lights, Bubbling roses' pinks and whites — Such a gay carpet! poppies by the million; Such damask! such vermilion!",15
694,"But if you ask me, mate, the choice of colour Is scarcely right; this red should have been duller.",15
695,"The early war poems had promoted patriotism, justice and principle.",15
696,It is striking that there was this shift from principle to aesthetic response as the war progressed.,15
697,"It might be that it was the incessant closeness to blood, death and suffering that brought out these sentiments in men who had, on the whole, been raised in an education system that rejected such responses as feminine and unmasculine, and that promoted an abstract conception of justice and a stern morality of obedience to rules.",15
698,"If so, it could be that the impact of that experience parallels in a sharpened and intensified form the impact on women of the experience of child-bearing — a potent, personal experience that, however sanitised, brings a woman face-to-face with these three realities.",15
699,"Again, as in the previous case, if this aesthetic response is accepted as especially characteristic of women's moral awareness, it can be argued that it is an important element to in any full account of the moral.",15
700,"It should be encompassed within, competing against, any universal conception of morality.",15
701,"These are, then, two ways in which women may, and probably do, see morality in a different light from the way men typically see it.",15
702,This means that the first set of questions about facts mentioned at the outset can now be answered.,15
703,Male and female do appear to diverge in certain identifiable and significant ways.,15
704,"The moral  outlook a person has may — though this is, , only a statistical or average truth — depend on whether that person is male or female.",15
705,But these ideals are not gender-relative.,15
706,"And indeed, it is the potential complementarity of the views that is their most striking feature.",15
707,"But before turning to the central question of what ideals men and women adopt, it is worth speculating about what it is that causes these observable differences of moral outlook.",15
708,Answering question involves reference to the second group of facts which were mentioned at the beginning of this discussion facts about the systematic differences in the life-experience of women and men.,15
709,"Two main types of explanation are offered as accounting in these terms for the distinctive ways in which women and men approach moral questions: these are, first, predominantly biological explanations, and, second, predominantly social or cultural explanations.",15
710,"Differences, it is assumed, must either be biologically based, or they must be culturally induced, the result of education, upbringing and social pressure.",15
711,"One important aspect of attributing differences to biology attributing them to culture is that the second type of explanation leaves room for views to change, while the former appears to rule this out.",15
712,"This contrast may be more apparent than real, however, for new technologies of birth and reproduction may alter the biologically given to make possible a changed perspective that would have been inconceivable in the past.",15
713,"Anti-patriarchal utopias in which male power, if not man himself, has been eliminated, and in which women have created a new social structure, are convincingly depicted in feminist science-fiction, and advocated as social policy by some radical feminist writers (see, Firestone, 1971).",15
714,"Both biological and cultural explanations, however, have sceptical implications as far as morality is concerned.",15
715,"If moral scepticism is to be avoided, then, it is important to appreciate both the scope and the limits of these sorts of explanation.",15
716,The Biological Thesis,15
717,"This, which may also be called the socio-biological or ‘geneticist’ thesis, asserts that innate biological factors determine a person's morality.",15
718,"Thus, in the case of the sexes, it sees different moral qualities as part of male or female ‘nature’— qualities and contrasts  aggressiveness or docility; kindness or cruelty; selfishness or unselfishness; conscientiousness or carelessness.",15
719,The thesis is essentially deterministic: we cannot escape from what our genes make of us.,15
720,"And so it considerably curtails the scope for morality, for it leads to such questions as: Why, if it is genetic factors that make people what they are, praise or blame them for what they do?",15
721,Why not simply accept the way they — men and women — behave?,15
722,The Sociological Thesis,15
723,"This is the thesis that it is social or cultural factors that determine a person's moral view-factors environment, upbringing and social context.",15
724,Coupled with this factual thesis is the full-blooded relativist view that there only these different views; that to talk about morality is to make reference to them; and that there is no fact-of-the-matter; no independent concept of right and wrong; of good and bad; of duty or responsibility.,15
725,"Within this second type of explanation, two very different theses may be distinguished:",15
726,"(i) the view that dominating differences are related to non-gender-related contrasts: , social class, economic structure, and a broad range of cultural factors.",15
727,(ii) the view that the salient and overriding cultural phenomenon gender.,15
728,"This view, then, may be distinguished from the ‘orthodox’ sociological view for separate consideration: it is the patriarchy thesis.",15
729,The Patriarchy Thesis,15
730,"This is the thesis that women's morality, which in certain vital respects, particularly sexual behaviour, often differs from men's, has been imposed on them by centuries of conditioning by men.",15
731,It differs from the standard sociological thesis in that it regards the gender difference as the most fundamental and most fully explanatory division in human society.,15
732,It holds that across cultures and forms of social arrangement women have been kept in subservience to men.,15
733,"there is this domination, it must be acknowledged that men have been aided in their domination of women by women themselves — sometimes older women, whose own conditioning has  matured in conformity with that of men.",15
734,"In other words, men's moral requirements may not be imposed on women, but indirectly through the filter of female complicity.",15
735,"Recognising this paradox lends weight to the patriarchy thesis, explaining away many apparent counter-examples.",15
736,", if clitorectomy often known as female circumcision — is a ‘moral’ requirement to serve male interests, it is nevertheless women who carry out, maintain and insist upon the practice, and it is women who express their moral offence if it is not carried out.",15
737,This may lead those who would otherwise oppose the practice to defend it on cultural grounds.,15
738,"its far-reaching effects on individual women's lives, however, it is difficult not to see it as, on the contrary, a potent example of the weakness of an orthodox relativist view — a view, , which attempts, incoherently, to maintain the equal validity of all moral perspectives.",15
739,For many feminists resist the relativist conclusion in this case to demand that both women and men shake themselves free of their conditioning.,15
740,This reveals a fundamental contrast between either biological or sociological determinism and the patriarchy thesis.,15
741,"Characteristically, the patriarchy thesis generates a revolutionary ideology a fatalistic acceptance of determinism and relativism.",15
742,It rejects the tyranny of local culture and regards even biological ‘necessity’ as manipulable.,15
743,"It results in an appeal, a call, to women to throw off the bonds of conditioning, to take freedom to control their own lives.",15
744,But it must be asked how far such autonomy is a realistic possibility.,15
745,"If there are some brute facts, perhaps social, but founded in biological difference, which separate the lives and experience of women from those of men, may these not continue ineluctably to affect the moral ideals they may hold?",15
746,Is there something about woman's experience as a biological and social being that gives her a common identity and differentiates her forever from the male?,15
747,Or are differences only superficially cultural?,15
748,Was Margaret Mead (1935) right to see woman as ‘an infinitely malleable clay figure upon which mankind has draped ever varying period-costumes’?,15
749,"And was Simone de Beauvoir (1972) justified in believing that, because women ‘live dispersed among the males, attached through residence, housework, economic condition, and social standing to certain men — fathers or husbands — more firmly than they are to other women’, they can have no common identity or history?",15
750,"I want to suggest that whatever anthropological and economic truths are embodied in these and similar statements, the fact is that  there are indeed certain systematic differences in the lives of women and of men, and that this fundamental contrast in life-experience does indeed account for and to some extent also justify a difference in their moral outlook and assumptions.",15
751,"This is not simply a matter of those aspects of women's sexual lives that are so often cited in evidence as disqualifying women from running the affairs of nations, or even from running a small business: menstruation and premenstrual tension; conception, pregnancy and childbirth; lactation and child-care.",15
752,"These are important, but they are surface phenomena, overtly physical.",15
753,What they connect with is a much deeper and more significant fact.,15
754,"This central fact is the fact of change, together with the problems of identity and self-concept that this generates.",15
755,For women characteristically experience change in their lives in a way which is only experienced by a man if he is unfortunate enough to be the victim of some mutilating accident or illness.,15
756,"The horror depicted in Kafka's , in which a man awakens to discover that he has become a large insect, invites comparison with the norms of women's existence — her passages from childhood to puberty, from mature womanhood to menopause and old age; her experience of pregnancy.",15
757,Kafka's begins with the following passage:,15
758,As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect.,15
759,"He was lying on his hard, armour-plated, back and when he lifted his head he could see his domelike brown belly divided into stiff arched segments which the bed quilt could hardly keep in position and was about to slide off completely.",15
760,"His numerous legs, which were pitifully thin compared to the rest of his bulk, waved helplessly before his eyes.",15
761,What has happened to me? he thought.,15
762,It was no dream.,15
763,"His room, a regular human bedroom, only rather too small, lay quiet between the four familiar walls.",15
764,It is interesting to compare this with Sylvia Plath's poem about her own experience of pregnancy and child-bearing:,15
765,"I am a mountain now, among mountainy women.",15
766,The doctors move among us our bigness Frightened the mind.,15
767,They smile like fools.,15
768,"They are to blame for what I am, and they know it — They hug their flatness like a kind of health.",15
769,"And what if they found themselves surprised, as I did?",15
770,They would go mad with it.,15
771,"Pregnancy, however, is a relatively brief and dramatic bodily change, succeeded by reversion to something like the former state.",15
772,As Plath later continues:,15
773,I am not ugly.,15
774,I am even beautiful.,15
775,The mirror gives back a woman without deformity.,15
776,"The nurses give back my clothes, and an identity.",15
777,"This contrasts with the two major irreversible shifts of a woman's life, first to puberty, then to menopause.",15
778,"These not only cause a change in — the way a woman sees herself — but, more important, a change in the way she is perceived by other people.",15
779,"she may cry, as Gregor Samsa does to his parents, sister and employer, that the same person is there inside, looking out in the same way at the world.",15
780,"The world a woman, in a way it does not see a man, as old or young, sexual or non-sexual, defining her frequently by nothing her biological role: mother, spouse, grandmother, widow.",15
781,"It is not surprising, then, that both the phases of major transition, the experience of pregnancy and childbirth can bring mental disturbance and breakdown in their wake.",15
782,These are rightly described as pressure-points in the lives of women.,15
783,"It would not be surprising, either, if this flux and change in the self were to generate a more flexible response to morality, and one that is peculiarly sensitive to the aesthetic dimension.",15
784,Women's experience continually forces them to react to situations in which the parameters have shifted.,15
785,"If one adds to this one other incontrovertible fact — that the overwhelming majority of women have lived their lives without economic freedom or autonomy, but as dependants or chattels lacking control over the crucial fixed aspects of their own lives — then it becomes clear that the chameleon nature of women is their necessary self-protection.",15
786,"As in the case of that animal, their clothes must fit their habitat, changing external change.",15
787,"In this respect, a famously offensive passage by Rousseau on the education of girls may be seen as, after all, no more  than realistic for period and place: recommending that girls be taught to break off games they are enjoying to return to work without complaint, he writes:",15
788,"This habitual restraint produces a docility which woman requires all her life long, for she will always be in subjection to a man, or to man's judgment, and she will never be free to set her own opinion above his.",15
789,"What is most wanted in a woman is gentleness; formed to obey a creature so imperfect as man, a creature often vicious and always faulty, she should early learn to submit to injustice and to suffer the wrongs inflicted on her by her husband without complaint.",15
790,"(Rousseau, 1762, trans., p. 333)",15
791,"The ‘masculine’ goal of moral autonomy, then, has been no more in woman's grasp than it was within the grasp of the Stoic slave of ancient times.",15
792,"And just as the ethical perspective of Stoicism was shaped by the slave-status of some of its principal proponents, so the ethical perspective of women has evolved within a framework of powerlessness to affect external events — even the lives of her own children within the family structure — and powerlessness to resist the inexorable internal cycle of obtrusive biological change, with the social and economic concomitants of that change that are absent in the case of the more modulated maturing and ageing processes of men.",15
793,"The conclusion to be drawn from these reflections is, I believe, that the ways in which women's lives differ from those of men are indeed morally significant.",15
794,"It may be that the effects of those significant differences can be mitigated by social change, and by education for mutual understanding.",15
795,"But because the weight of explanation is preponderantly biological cultural or social, it may be that women's moral perspective will continue to be one which reflects a distinctive range of values.",15
796,"The feminist goal must be the interweaving of those values, which have a richness, complexity and spontaneity lacking in more abstract conceptions, with the universalistic goals of traditional moral theory.",15
797,"In practice, this may mean as little as insisting on modest changes in decision-making procedures and modes of academic debate; or it may mean as much as the sacrifice of a whole way of life for activism in some major political cause.",15
798,But if there is to be a new morality — new values for the new situation resulting from  technological and political change in the closing years of the twentieth century — then the creation of that new morality must in the end be a joint enterprise of both women and men.,15
799,4,15
800,Autonomy and Pornography,15
801,Alison Assiter,15
802,"There is a notion of autonomy implicit in some philosophical writing and including the work of Rousseau, Kant, Hegel and Marx.",15
803,"this conception, a person is autonomous if he or she subscribes to principles that have been formed by his or her own moral scrutiny.",15
804,Integral to some of the philosophers' thinking is the idea that the individual is part of a collective; a member of society.,15
805,"For me to be autonomous, it is not sufficient that you leave me alone; rather the way I am treated by you has a bearing on my autonomy, and reciprocally for you.",15
806,"In this paper, I shall defend a qualified version of autonomy along Kantian lines.",15
807,"I shall then show, by reference to the work of Kant and Hegel, how autonomy has been excluded from the private realm.",15
808,"Even Hegel, who apparently extends the notion of autonomy to the private domain does not really do so.",15
809,"Indeed, ironically, the relation between lovers turns out, for him, to involve the most extreme possible violation of autonomy; in fact, the relation between lovers turns out to fit a relation Hegel argues must be transcended — that between Master and Slave.",15
810,"Against the thinking of these philosophers, I propose to defend the view that the individual should be treated as a rational, autonomous being in perhaps the most private of all domains — that of love-making.",15
811,I shall support the view a criticism of pornographic eroticism.,15
812,"Pornographic eroticism, I will argue, is, therefore, to be condemned, but it does not function in quite the way some feminists have argued that it does.",15
813,"Andrea Dworkin, in her book (1981), argues that porn lies at the heart of male supremacy, of the oppression of women.",15
814,"I believe that this view is too strong, that, although porn does reinforce certain attitudes towards women, , it is rather a symptom, and not a major part of the cause, of power  relations that exist outside the pages of etc., and outside the cinemas in Soho or Amsterdam (see Moye, 1985).",15
815,A DEFENCE OF AUTONOMY,15
816,An autonomous person is one who is self-legislating and self-determining.,15
817,The most common sort of violation of autonomy is paternalism — where the person is coerced into giving up some or all of it.,15
818,"At its most extreme, someone's capacity to choose which course of action to perform is removed from them.",15
819,"Thus, if a person is given a drug which gets rid of any resistance he/she might have had to being taken into captivity, then, in a very strong sense, his/her autonomy has been violated.",15
820,"But, in a slightly weaker sense, someone may lose their autonomy if the opportunity for them to exercise their capacity to choose is removed.",15
821,"Thus, a person who becomes a slave loses this opportunity.",15
822,"A particular sort of slavery, what we might call moral slavery, occurs if a person is forced to act someone else's moral values.",15
823,"All the above types of violation of a person's autonomy involve what Kant described as treating the person as a means to someone else's end, and not as an end in themselves.",15
824,"We ought, he said, to ‘treat humanity whether in your own person, or in the person of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end’(Kant, 1948, para. 429).",15
825,"Intuitively, we would judge these violations of a person's autonomy as wrong.",15
826,Why?,15
827,Kant argued that could voluntarily relinquish their autonomy without giving up their personhood.,15
828,"It is logically impossible, he argued, to contract to give up all one's rights, since such a contract would deprive the person of the ability to make any agreements .",15
829,This argument has been questioned.,15
830,One person who has done so recently is Arthur Kulfik (1984).,15
831,He says:,15
832,the argument falters on a temporal equivocation.,15
833,"the moment that the contract is made, or more accurately is to take effect, the agent retains both his status as a person and whatever rights this entails, including the right to make a contract.",15
834,Only after the contract takes effect does the agent (putatively)‘cease to be a person’.,15
835,(p. 283),15
836,"I agree with Kuflik that it is not actually impossible to contract to give up one's autonomy, but I do not think, however, that Kant's argument can be so easily disposed of.",15
837,"Who, in their right mind, would voluntarily relinquish something that has as a consequence the loss of their personhood?",15
838,"Who, if they recognised and understood the consequences of their actions, would choose such a course?",15
839,Perhaps only those for whom life itself had ceased to be worth living.,15
840,", if they didn't recognise the consequences, they might choose to do it, but this illustrates Kant's point.",15
841,"a person did not know the consequences of giving up their autonomy, it is in fact these consequences which make the relinquishing of autonomy wrong.",15
842,"It has been argued recently, however,(see Graham, 1982) that it must be rational for a person to give up their autonomy sometimes.",15
843,"One case often cited is that, , it is rational to take orders from a competent doctor in a course of treatment.",15
844,Another is that two people may have conflicting beliefs about which course of action to perform.,15
845,"Since it may not be possible for both sets of belief to be realised in action, if the courses of action are incompatible, it may be rational for one person to give up his/her autonomy.",15
846,"As far as the first case is concerned, I take it that part of the process of rational reflection on a set of moral principles and courses of action for myself would involve consulting others (the experts, if you like).",15
847,"Deferring to a doctor is not in itself being coerced into accepting a view against one's will, thus this need not involve the loss of autonomy.",15
848,"the second type of case, something that Kant had to say may again be relevant.",15
849,He argued that I should treat other people's wants and needs as constraints upon the satisfaction of my own.,15
850,"In other words, the rational being who is autonomously evaluating the most appropriate courses of action for him/herself must consider the wants, needs and interests of others.",15
851,"The non-satisfaction of my wants, needs etc., therefore, is not always a violation of my autonomy.",15
852,"Autonomy involves the right and the capacity to exercise choice and to make reasoned judgements, and not the capacity to have those judgements invariably realised in action.",15
853,"The dictator (to look at one of Keith Graham's examples) who allowed everyone to decide for themselves what they wanted and then told them what they must do, is violating their autonomy not because their wants and needs are not realised in action, but because they have been coerced into doing something they do not want.",15
854,"Thus autonomy is lost or renounced either if someone is coerced  into thinking/acting against their will, or if a person is treated perhaps willingly — as a means to the satisfaction of someone else's desires or ends.",15
855,There may conceivably be cases where it is for someone willingly to allow themselves to be treated as a means.,15
856,"If, , I volunteered to give up some of my bone marrow to save a person suffering from leukaemia, then, my own health was not in danger, there would seem to be nothing wrong with my momentarily relinquishing my autonomy.",15
857,"Perhaps, therefore, a distinction should be drawn between allowing oneself voluntarily, and where there is no danger to oneself, to be treated as a means to the satisfaction of someone else's , and being treated as a means to the satisfaction of someone else's desires.",15
858,Only in the former case could a violation of autonomy conceivably be justified.,15
859,"Again, it might be argued that there can be nothing wrong for a person voluntarily to allow themselves to be treated as a means to the satisfaction of someone else's desires.",15
860,"If Justine, in the work of the eighteenth-century ‘pornographer’, the Marquis de Sade, willingly submitted, what is wrong with her allowing herself to be treated in whatever fashion her persecutors wanted?",15
861,"I shall argue, later, that such treatment is wrong, not necessarily , but for other reasons.",15
862,HEGEL AND LOVE-MAKING,15
863,Most philosophers who have defended autonomy have exempted the private realm from the domain of its operation.,15
864,"Kant, , quite explicitly did this.",15
865,"He reduced wives, children and servants to the status of ‘things’ so far as their relation to husband/father in the family is concerned.",15
866,He argued that the husband/father has the right to the possession of wife/children as ‘things’.,15
867,"In other words, wives, in their marital relation to their husbands, were quite specifically treated by Kant as not autonomous.",15
868,"In their role as wives and lovers, then, women, for Kant, were viewed as means to the satisfaction of the man's needs and wants.",15
869,Ostensibly Hegel's view is different.,15
870,"In he argues, against Kant, and others, that the sphere of operation of contractual relations is limited.",15
871,Family life lies quite outside its domain.,15
872,Hegel is adamant than human beings cannot be reduced to  the status of ‘things’.,15
873,"He argues, against Kant, that has the right to alienate their entire ‘person’ through a contract.",15
874,"He claims that rights arising from contract are never rights over a person, but only rights over something external to the person — , that person's body.",15
875,"Kant, Hegel, forgets that there are some aspects of personality that cannot be alienated: , ‘my universal freedom of will, my ethical life, my religion’(para. 66).",15
876,"In marriage, Hegel argues, neither husband nor wife treats the other as his/her property.",15
877,Family members are linked through love.,15
878,"Morality, at this level, appears as something natural.",15
879,"Through love, the individual renounces his/her egoistic standpoint, and becomes united with the loved one.",15
880,"Individuals, through love, become real social beings, each identifying with and loving through the other.",15
881,"The love between man and wife, therefore, apparently presupposes man and wife treating as equal, autonomous beings.",15
882,Each has to find him/herself partly through the other.,15
883,"In love, men and women are ‘living subjects who are alike in power and thus in 's eyes’(para. 62).",15
884,"Apparently, then, Hegel is extending a notion of full autonomy to the sphere of love-making.",15
885,"Yet, on the other hand, and in tension with the foregoing, Hegel argues that, although the male does not ‘own’ wife or children, he is in control of family property.",15
886,"For legal purposes, the family is represented by its head: the father/husband.",15
887,"Moreover, it is also the father/husband's role in modern industrial society to go ‘out’ to work in the world outside.",15
888,"It is only the man who enters civil society (the ‘public’ sphere) and, in that world, he represents the other family members.",15
889,"Daughters and wives, by contrast, are expected to remain, throughout their lives, in the family network.",15
890,Their activities have no direct economic significance.,15
891,"Thus, although ostensibly the relation between husband and wife in love-making is a relation between equals, in fact it is not.",15
892,"The power of the father is not quite like that of the ‘patriarch’ in Filmer's (1680), yet his activities outside the home invest him with an importance which the wife does not have.",15
893,These powers will limit the extent to which men and women can be autonomous and equal in love-making.,15
894,"Moreover, Hegel explicitly distinguishes the ‘natures’ of the two sexes.",15
895,"Man is a creature of ‘reason’, woman is intuitive; man is ‘powerful and active’, woman passive and subjective (para. 166).",15
896,"In other words, Hegel elevates some of the traits which characterise men as powerful masculine beings, women as feminine, to the status of differences in their natures.",15
897,"Therefore, the appearance that the relation between husband and wife in love-making is one between equal autonomous partners, is an appearance only.",15
898,"In losing themselves in their partners, men and women are renouncing unequal qualities.",15
899,The man has to give up some of his power; the woman must gain some.,15
900,But this suggests that it is actually impossible for Hegel to realise what appears to be an ideal notion of the relationship between lovers.,15
901,Losing oneself in the other when one party is more powerful than the other can only mean the one submitting to the other.,15
902,"Two wills becoming one, when the two wills were initially unequal can surely only mean the one will subordinating itself to the other.",15
903,"Thus, in the end, it looks Hegel's view of the relation between husband and wife in marriage is not very different from Kant's.",15
904,"Indeed, although Hegel does not admit quite what I am now suggesting, he effectively concedes that, given the difference between the sexes, unity between them is impossible.",15
905,"‘Man has his ‘substantive life’ in the State, in learning , whereas the ‘substantive destiny’of woman lies in the family’(para. 166 again).",15
906,", Hegel restricts his discussion of love to that between husband and wife in marriage.",15
907,"It is only inside what is, in the end, a contractual relation, that ‘love’ can prevail.",15
908,"‘Love’ therefore between a non-married man and woman, or between two men or two women would be impossible.",15
909,"describing a relation between equals, Hegel's picture of love-making is very like his account of the relation between Master and Slave, in the Master-Slave dialectic, described in his .",15
910,"This relation in fact, for Hegel, represents a stage to be overcome, in the evolution of spirit towards rational self-awareness.",15
911,"Indeed, Kant and Hegel's accounts of the relation between man and wife in love-making are actually not far removed from a description of pornographic eroticism.",15
912,The Master-Slave dialectic is an apt metaphor for the latter.,15
913,Let us have a look at the passage to see how this might be.,15
914,THE MASTER-SLAVE RELATION,15
915,In this passage Hegel is asking the question: How do I become aware of myself as a self?,15
916,He believes that ‘desires’ are important to the consciousness of our own existence.,15
917,"As people act on things because they want them — the child wants a teddy bear, or wants something to eat — they begin to gain a sense of themselves as distinct from those objects.",15
918,"Hegel, however, argues that we cannot be fully aware of ourselves, as selves, unless we are conscious of other people.",15
919,"Here he is on the importance of the view of ‘the other’ to one's sense of self: ‘Self consciousness exists in and for itself, when, and by the fact that, it so exists for another; , it exists only in being acknowledged’(Hegel, 1979, p. 111).",15
920,"Hegel suggests that we all aim to be recognised by others wanting to be noticed by others, to be deemed worthy by others are traits we all have.",15
921,"Sometimes, indeed, we identify another seeing ourselves as independent autonomous subjects, we identify with Lady Diana, our headmistress or somebody at work.",15
922,"But, says Hegel, if identity lies outside myself — in my head of department, in my father — it is outside my control.",15
923,"Therefore, Hegel suggests, I — the jealous one — may set out to destroy the person in whom my ‘self-hood’ resides.",15
924,", few of us set out to destroy someone of whom we are jealous; Hegel is describing an extreme form of such a feeling.",15
925,"Taking it as far as it can be taken, Hegel suggests that the conflict between myself and the person in whom my identity resides will become a struggle between life and death, because, he says, it is only by risking one's life that one becomes fully aware of oneself as a free, autonomous individual.",15
926,"It is only when I realise how fragile my life as a human being is, by becoming aware of its limits, that I can become a fully free person.",15
927,"However, we must remember what we earlier quoted Hegel as saying: that the other person's attitude towards me is important for my sense of self-identity.",15
928,"So I must neither die myself, nor must I destroy the individual in whom my identity resides.",15
929,"Since we cannot go on struggling with indefinitely, Hegel says that one must submit to the other.",15
930,The one who submits he calls the ‘slave’ and the one to whom that person submits him/herself becomes the ‘master’.,15
931,Thus we get Dependence and Independence of Self Consciousness: Master and Slave.,15
932,Hegel believes that the ‘Master-Slave dialectic’ is a phase in the development of world history — in the progression towards freedom  of the ‘Spirit’that controls historical change.,15
933,"In fact, the relation is disadvantageous both for the slave and for the master.",15
934,"Indeed, he thinks that whereas the master fails to gain a proper sense of himself from the slave, because the slave merely carries out his (the master's) will, the slave gain a certain degree of self-consciousness the work he performs for the master.",15
935,It seems to me that this passage describes the way loving relationships turn out to be for Hegel.,15
936,"Ostensibly, the relation between man and wife, where they are linked by love, and that between Master and Slave, are very different.",15
937,"Yet, as I argued earlier, giving up one's identity to another who is more powerful can only mean submitting oneself to the other.",15
938,"In the end, the role of the wife in marriage is very like that of the Slave.",15
939,But the Master-Slave dialectic seems to capture the relation between people in pornographic eroticism.,15
940,"In much pornography, people, usually women, become objects for another.",15
941,"The philosopher Sartre believed that, in the act of love-making, the lover becomes subject and object — for she sees herself partly as the body desired by the lover.",15
942,"But then her identity is partly outside her control, so she tries to turn her lover into an object (Sartre, 1957, pt.",15
943,"III, ch. 3).",15
944,"In the case of pornography, what happens is that the one person becomes a body desired by the other, but this is not reciprocated.",15
945,"In much porn, the woman becomes the ‘object’ of male desire.",15
946,"She either involuntarily submits in this role (as does the woman on the pages of ) or she does it voluntarily, like de Sade's Justine or ‘O’ in the pornographic novel by Pauline Reage,.",15
947,"In that story women are taken to a castle, where they are abused and tormented by men.",15
948,"‘O’ is enslaved by her lover Rene, yet she voluntarily submits; she is represented as desiring subordination.",15
949,"Since the identity of the lover — the woman — becomes submerged in the other lover's desire for her/his body, one of the two may become afraid and want to kill the other.",15
950,"In a recent hard-core pornographic film from Denmark, the woman ends up killing the man.",15
951,"Throughout the film, it has been the man, the dominant male, who got the woman to act out his wishes and fantasies.",15
952,"The woman's killing the man seems metaphorical only, but it fits the present idea — that the one whose identity becomes submerged may want to kill the other.",15
953,"But sometimes, in porn, it is the dominant man who takes his domination to the extreme and kills the woman: in Norman Mailer's , the woman — the slave — dies.",15
954,De Sade said that if one wants to know  about death one should look at sexual excitement.,15
955,"And Sigmund Freud, in , described the ‘drive to inorganicism’ as ‘the most radical form of the pleasure principle’.",15
956,Sexuality affords us the opportunity of transgressing the barrier separating life from death.,15
957,"But mostly, even in porn, the taboo against killing is upheld.",15
958,"Instead we have the Master-Slave relation: one person partly being seen as the body desired by the other, but where this is not reciprocated.",15
959,"Unlike Hegel's slave, however, who loses his subjectivity to the Master, the ‘slave’ in porn must retain some subjectivity or she will cease being desirable to the master.",15
960,The subjectivity she has is as a subject who desires to be object-a subject who wants only to satisfy the wants of the Master.,15
961,"Things ought not to be this way, in love-making, however.",15
962,"People ought to treat as people, as autonomous beings, in love-making, as elsewhere.",15
963,"One of the things wrong with porn, therefore, is that someone's — usually the woman's — autonomy is violated.",15
964,PORN AND FANTASY,15
965,"Porn, however, involves fantasy.",15
966,"Often, in pornographic eroticism, there is no real love-making between people.",15
967,"One writer claims that the use to which the most heavily read porn —and — is likely to be put, is as material for masturbatory fantasies (Moye, 1985, p. 53).",15
968,What can be wrong with this?,15
969,Let us imagine ourselves as a reader of to answer this question.,15
970,"In one picture in the centre pages of a copy of the magazine, a woman is smiling, relaxed; she stares erotically at her viewer.",15
971,"The viewer can lay aside, in his fantasy relation to this woman, the difficult, complex emotions he will experience in any actual relationship with a real woman, and concentrate upon his own desire.",15
972,"He can picture the woman to whom he is relating, as uncomplicatedly wanting him, her desire being to satisfy his.",15
973,"Thus to use the contemporary philosopher Richard Wollheim's (1985) analogy of the mind as a theatre, he is, in his fantasy, an actor in a play that he has written, and she — the woman on the page — is in it too, as his adoring lover, his woman who is totally fixated upon him.",15
974,"The woman represented on the pages of is depicted, as I  have said, as a subject who desires to be object: she appears to want just to satisfy the desire of the man who gazes at her as he masturbates.",15
975,"What can be wrong, however, with fantasising, treating a woman as an object, if there is no connection between the fantasy and real life and if she is depicted as wanting to be treated this way?",15
976,"Wollheim, as I have mentioned, depicts the mind as a theatre.",15
977,"In the theatre, he argues, there is (a) an internal dramatist — who makes up the characters and their actions;(b) an internal actor — who represents to the reader for his benefit the actions he has made up as dramatist; and, finally,(c) an internal audience.",15
978,"After the fantasy performance, we, the individuals doing the fantasising, are left with some reactions to our fantasy.",15
979,The first type of link between the fantasy representation and the world outside is that the fantasy materials — the characters in the play and their actions — are drawn from real life.,15
980,"Even novels which appear to be furthest removed from the lives of those who wrote them — the work of Kafka, of Lewis Carroll, of the contemporary feminist writer Marge Piercy — have drawn on the real life surroundings of their authors.",15
981,And there is a particularly close connection in the case we are considering.,15
982,"The fantasy relation between reader and text, in the case of a man reading more like the relation between consumer and a realist novel than it is like that between reader and the text of Kafka.",15
983,But this is obviously not sufficient reason for us to condemn the porn.,15
984,The fantasy had by the reader of may not involve any beliefs that real women behave as he imagines the woman on the page does.,15
985,So what grounds are there for condemning the porn?,15
986,Part of the grounds are the following.,15
987,"The evidence for a causal connection between reading pornographic material and committing violent acts against women is inconclusive (Williams, 1979).",15
988,"But there is not causal connection, the fantasy does have causal effect.",15
989,"Returning to Wollheim's analogy: when the reader of the porn performs, as internal actor, his fantasy, he is left, as internal audience, in a state that simulates the state he would be in if he had had a relationship with a woman like the imagined one.",15
990,The reader of is left feeling pleasure.,15
991,"And this, as Wollheim argues, though it may not lead to action like that in the representation, acts as a lure to the formation of fresh dispositions to act — of fresh desires.",15
992,"In other words, the representation of the desire as pleasurably satisfied, reinforces the desire.",15
993,"Thus pornographic representations are to be condemned  because they reinforce the desires to treat people, and it is usually , i n the way I have been arguing they are treated.",15
994,"The fantasy desire a man, to have a woman adoring him, and to have her interested only in satisfying his desires, reinforces such desires in him.",15
995,"And such desires, as I have argued, involve treating women as means, and not as ends in themselves.",15
996,Such desires may involve coercing the woman into behaving in the way the man wants her to.,15
997,"the desire is satisfied in any but the fantasy way, the man who constantly has such desires is to be condemned, for he is gaining satisfaction from a person whom he has divested of personhood and turned into a slave.",15
998,"Because he is constantly having desires for these partial relationships satisfied, he is less likely to seek out non-distorting, non-partial relationships in the rest of his life.",15
999,"Thus a full description of what is wrong with pornography is that it reinforces desires men to treat women as objects, as means, and thus, indirectly, it reinforces male power.",15
1000,"Though the woman depicted on the pages of the magazines may be represented as wanting to be treated as a means, this type of depiction of women is commonplace, and is one of the major expressions of women's oppression.",15
1001,"Thus, should be treated purely as a means anyway.",15
1002,"But, additionally in the case of porn, treating women this way has the consequence of reinforcing male power.",15
1003,"Not treating women as autonomous, in pornographic love-making, has the consequence of reinforcing women's subordination.",15
1004,"Pornography is not, as Dworkin (1981) suggests it is, the main causal agent of women's subordination, because it is merely one case of a phenomenon that is commonplace: women have been treated as objects throughout history.",15
1005,"In much Greek thought, women were represented as being closer to nature than men; their role in reproduction connected them to nature's fertility.",15
1006,"Being closer to nature, they are more like objects than human beings.",15
1007,"In the courtly love tradition, the woman was put on a pedestal — objectified.",15
1008,Such a conception of women has continued down the centuries.,15
1009,"If fantasy depictions of others are likely to have consequences for one's behaviour outside the fantasy, then so are ways of treating the other in love-making.",15
1010,"Thus, a man's not treating a woman as autonomous in love-making is likely to have consequences for the way he treats her elsewhere.",15
1011,"Before concluding, I would like to raise a couple of objections to the view I am advocating.",15
1012,SOME OBJECTIONS CONSIDERED,15
1013,"First of all, it might be argued that there is no reason why the man should treat the woman, in fantasy, in the way that I've described.",15
1014,"Why should he not view her as a fully rounded subject, with wants and desires of her own?",15
1015,Part of the answer is surely just the way in which the woman on the page is presented.,15
1016,"She appears, somehow, just as a woman whose main desire is to satisfy the wants of the one who gazes at her.",15
1017,"But, additionally, pornographic magazines are bought and sold.",15
1018,"In other words, once the magazine has come into his possession, the man acquires the right to treat the images on its pages in whichever way he chooses.",15
1019,"Thus he is able to treat the woman as infinitely desirous of sex, as wanting nothing to satisfy his desires.",15
1020,"A second objection that will be brought is that it is odd to treat another as a rational being, in the Kantian sense, in erotic relations, of all places.",15
1021,"It will be objected that love-making necessarily includes an irrational, a Dionysian, element that is obscured by what I am saying at the moment.",15
1022,"I would argue, however, that love-making ought not to be treated as drawing only on the irrational side of a person's nature.",15
1023,"Part of the process of treating another well, in love-making, is attempting to satisfy her/his desires, and this, of necessity, involves the ability to recognise them.",15
1024,"In turn, this presupposes treating the other as a person, as, partly, a rational being.",15
1025,"So, although there is an irrational element to eroticism, it ought, I am arguing, not to be so irrational a process violate the other's autonomy.",15
1026,"Thirdly, the criticism might be made that the distinction I earlier drew (in the section on ‘Autonomy’)— between someone voluntarily being treated as a means to the satisfaction of another's needs, and their being treated as a means to the satisfaction of another's desires — is not adequate here.",15
1027,The man reading will argue that he has a need for it.,15
1028,"This suggests, I think, that I must refine my earlier criterion in the following way: it is wrong for a person to be treated as a means to the satisfaction of another's desire, and only allowable for them to be treated, with their consent, as a means to the satisfaction of another's needs, if no other means for their  satisfaction can be made available.",15
1029,"The need to read of a different order from the need for my bone marrow — in the latter case, it is assumed, at the present level of development of medicine, that no alternative is possible while, in the former, it is much easier to produce alternative means (including other sorts of magazines).",15
1030,"Indeed the former is a matter of life and death, while the latter is not.",15
1031,CONCLUSION,15
1032,"In this paper, I have argued that, the thinking of some of the major representatives of the tradition which distinguishes the public world from the private one, the notion of autonomy ought to be extended to the private sphere.",15
1033,"Part of what is wrong with pornographic eroticism, where people are not treated as autonomous, is that it reinforces men's desires to treat women as means, as objects, in areas of their lives the erotic.",15
1034,"By excluding love-making from the sphere of operation of the notion of autonomy, Kant and Hegel were limiting its scope in the ‘public’ realm.",15
1035,"What goes on inside the family, even in the most private of all relations between human beings, has effects outside the family.",15

1039,SOME OF OUR CHILDREN ARE MISSING,15
1040,Children have served philosophy very well.,15
1041,That is the first thing which anyone surveying the literature would notice.,15
1042,"a selection from a list including women, animals, madmen, foreigners, slaves, patients and imbeciles, children have served in that great class of beings, the ‘not-men’, in contrast with which male philosophers have defined and valued themselves.",15
1043,"Unlike the others who appear and disappear as fashion and progress dictate, children occupy a permanent place in the list partly their continuing presence as a potential sub-class, partly because they have never protested and mainly because it is assumed that in favourable circumstances they will become men and therefore require attention.",15
1044,They have received it in the shape of detailed educational theory carefully worked out to see them through the maturation process from infancy to adulthood.,15
1045,Generations of philosophers have documented this process.,15
1046,Perhaps the best known version is Shakespeare's seven ages of man which is a poetic statement of what had already been received wisdom for centuries and was to remain so for centuries to come.,15
1047,"Education was to guide the infant through the transition to manhood including such stages as childhood, boyhood and youth.",15
1048,That is the second thing to notice; the philosopher's children are boys.,15
1049,"The fact that half of the world's children would not actually go through this process beyond the first two stages is conveniently forgotten or ignored and, , the reasons for this were largely social.",15
1050,"But the neglect of girl children through the centuries of theorising is more than a social injustice, though many might think this real and bad enough.",15
1051,Education has an end.,15
1052,"Although it is fashionable to talk about its value ‘for its own sake’, what prompts the theorising is the strong and well-founded belief that the experiences of childhood affect the kind of adult which the child turns out to be.",15
1053,"Where the end is  person- role-oriented — , where the end is the development of the human mind and spirit the production of, say, information technologists — then education is valued some conception of worthwhile human existence which it is meant to serve.",15
1054,"Such an ideal does not stand isolated from the practices which strive towards it but interacts with those practices, helps to construct them, and is in turn constructed by them.",15
1055,The great philosophers have always produced such a person-oriented account for those whose education was thought to matter.,15
1056,"Education has been directed at the production of the rational, the free, the independent of mind, the dignified, , the autonomous human being.",15
1057,"Yet because the philosopher's adult has traditionally been male, his children boy children, and his educational programmes designed to facilitate the transition between them, the ideal of the fully human person has been masculinised to the point where otherwise thoughtful and sometimes good and wise men have unashamedly admitted that this defining ideal is not applicable to half the species.",15
1058,"Rationality turns into narrow intellectualism, freedom into licence, independence into isolationism, dignity into selfish pride; the autonomous human being turns out to be no more than a social atom after all.",15
1059,"The degeneration occurs, not because men are congenitally or even incorrigibly narrow, libertine, isolated or selfish, but because in defining themselves as autonomous beings in opposition to other human beings they have had to seek what separates them as a group from others.",15
1060,It is a curiously paradoxical foundation upon which to build a theory of autonomy.,15
1061,Moral autonomy is concerned with individuals not with groups; a conception of autonomy which depends upon group membership displays its own contradiction.,15
1062,This paper is partly about the rejection of certain accounts of autonomy though not with the rejection of the ideal of autonomy itself.,15
1063,It is also about children.,15
1064,WOMEN PHILOSOPHERS AND GIRL CHILDREN,15
1065,Why should women and women philosophers be specially interested in the nature and status of children?,15
1066,"There are, , the familiar and obvious reasons  connected with women's traditional role in child-rearing but there are less obvious reasons too.",15
1067,When philosophers dismiss women as ‘not-men’ they frequently do more than simply lump them together with children or lunatics.,15
1068,Explicitly or implicitly the suggestion is that women children or lunatics or whichever other company they keep.,15
1069,It would be well to know just what this entails.,15
1070,Schopenhauer said that women remain big children all their lives; it would be interesting to know what he thought children were like.,15
1071,"A common result of this is that when the philosophers deny autonomy to women, they do so for the same sorts of reason that they deny it to children and cite lack of rationality, capriciousness and vulnerability among their characteristics.",15
1072,We can do more than to reject such descriptions of ourselves; we can ask further questions: are children like this? is this why children are not autonomous?,15
1073,"Again, women well know what it is like to be treated as children and they find it offensive.",15
1074,It would therefore be reasonable to consider whether children find it offensive to be treated like children.,15
1075,Is being treated as a child an intrinsically humiliating and self-denying experience?,15
1076,What is it to be treated as a child?,15
1077,Women philosophers are in a special position to consider such questions for in the image of the philosopher's child they see themselves.,15
1078,"It is no accident that the liberation of women, it is, should form part of a wider movement of liberation ; liberation for one part of the ‘not-men’ is bound to have a knock-on effect when your fellow groups are sometimes quite literally identified with you.",15
1079,"The assumption that all groups in the ‘not-men’ class are identical with is so firmly rooted that, as we shall see in the fourth section, it is readily assumed even by modern libertarian thinkers that showing that, , some ground for distinguishing between men and women is false or irrelevant, immediately commits us to the view that the same ground is irrelevant in distinguishing men from children.",15
1080,‘That's what they used to say about women’ is not a proof that saying it about a child is false.,15
1081,But it should make us very suspicious.,15
1082,"That when women are given the vote it follows that children should be given it too is no argument , but a version of it occurs in modern debates over the justice or injustice of Mill's famous disclaimer in his essay .",15
1083,"Having denied that we may ever legitimately interfere with the liberty of another except on the grounds of self-protection, Mill (1910) asserts:",15
1084,this principle is meant to apply only to human beings in the  maturity of their faculties.,15
1085,We are not speaking of children or of young persons below the age which the law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood.,15
1086,Those who are still in a state to require being taken care of by others must be protected against their own actions against external injury.,15
1087,(p.73),15
1088,"This view, as we shall see, has been attacked on the grounds that it rests on the false assumption that the distinction between adults and children is identical with the distinction between rational and non-rational beings.",15
1089,The attacks are based on empirical observation; most women and older children are actually quite as rational as most men while some men are actually less rational.,15
1090,If we agree that in that case women should be embraced by the liberty principle then so should children.,15
1091,I shall suggest that this does not follow because rationality is not in fact the grounds for the distinction in the first place.,15
1092,"Partly to redress the balance and partly because talking about ‘children’ covers such a wide range of potential images, I shall try to keep before my mind an ordinary 10-year-old of our society.",15
1093,She is the child of this paper unless I indicate otherwise.,15
1094,"Throughout we should ask ourselves, does (whatever is being said) apply to ?",15
1095,"First of all, let us remind ourselves of the traditional picture of children drawn for us by some great philosophers of the past.",15
1096,One thing they are all quite sure about is that children are not like adults; they agree that children lack some capacity for rational thought which adults have.,15
1097,NOW WE ARE 6 — OR 10 — OR 18….,15
1098,"the slave has absolutely no deliberative faculty; the woman has but its authority is imperfect; so has the child, but in this case it is immature.",15
1099,"(Aristotle, 1959,1260A)",15
1100,"Children…are not endued with Reason , till they have attained the use of speech but are called Reasonable Creatures for the possibility apparent of having the use of Reason in time to come.",15
1101,"(Hobbes, 1914, p. 21)",15
1102,[Children]…love to be treated as Rational Creatures sooner than is imagined…[by which]…,15
1103,"I mean, that you should  make them sensible by the Mildness of your carriage, and the composure even in your correction of them, that what you do is reasonable in you and useful and necessary for them.",15
1104,"(Locke, 1968, p. 181)",15
1105,"In training for youth, the child must be given reasons; in the training of the infant for childhood this cannot be done.",15
1106,"Young children ought merely to have things shown to them as they are, or they get puzzled and ask question after question.",15
1107,But as we approach the age of youth reason appears.,15
1108,At what age ought the education for youth to begin?,15
1109,"Roughly at the age of ten years, when by nature the child enters the stage of youth and begins to reflect…",15
1110,"The youth…is capable of having principles; his religious and moral ideas can be cultivated, and he is able to attend to his own refinement.",15
1111,"(Kant, 1930, pp. 250–1)",15
1112,"If a society lets any considerable number of its members grow up mere children, incapable of being acted on by rational consideration of distant motives, society has itself to blame for the consequences.",15
1113,"(Mill, 1910, p. 139)",15
1114,What are the philosophers' children like?,15
1115,"They have an ‘immature’ deliberative faculty (Aristotle), are not ‘endued with Reason’(Hobbes), until roughly the age of 10 (Kant) and are ‘incapable of being acted upon by rational consideration of distant motives’(Mill).",15
1116,But they are not completely lost causes.,15
1117,The immature deliberative faculty will mature; children have the ‘possibility apparent’ of turning into rational beings (Hobbes); they love to be treated they were rational though they are not so yet (Locke); you can give the prerational child reasons for acting in certain ways and he will turn into the youth who is capable of having principles (Kant).,15
1118,Until the time when these things happen then Mill's disclaimer comes into operation.,15
1119,Children must be taken care of by others and protected from external injury and against their own actions.,15
1120,"The traditional view is encapsulated in the claim that children are not autonomous; , on a standard interpretation, they lack the capacity to act rationally their own self-chosen goals.",15
1121,It is then a matter of preference whether you say that they cannot choose the goals or that they cannot form strategies to achieve them or both.,15
1122,"In either case, the political implication is that denying rights  to children is entirely justified, and there the matter rests.",15
1123,"In all this, there are perhaps a couple of things which look plausible when we compare the philosopher's child with our mental picture; Aristotle's observation that children are immature and Mill's suggestion that they might need protection.",15
1124,"Beyond that, the similarities seem remote.",15
1125,There is obviously something wrong with a portrayal of children as totally lacking in reason until they leap bed on their tenth birthday announcing that they are now able to act on principle.,15
1126,"being false, such an account leaves no room in our thinking about children for things like teaching and learning, or development in understanding and character and all those other concepts which refer to processes and not to states.",15
1127,"The tension between these theoretical views of children as non-rational, non-autonomous beings and the practical knowledge of real children is evident in those quotations from Hobbes and Locke and Kant and Mill.",15
1128,"Children, Hobbes, have the ‘possibility apparent’ of becoming reasonable.",15
1129,In what does the possibility consist?,15
1130,Hobbes is not using an inductive argument here; the ‘possibility apparent’ is not an inductive argument from observations about past children but is meant to refer to some discernible feature of present ones.,15
1131,But what?,15
1132,"Hobbes does not tell us, but whatever it is it had better be something which a monkey does not have.",15
1133,It is not language since Hobbes is here talking about the prelinguistic child.,15
1134,Perhaps it consists in the ability to respond intelligently to the language of others.,15
1135,"But then, either Hobbes has failed to distinguish the child from the higher and domesticated animals or the force of ‘intelligently’ must be explained in such a way as to exclude animals.",15
1136,"In any case, if such a qualification is called for it is hard to see how a creature with no rationality could possess it.",15
1137,Locke's remarks are just as puzzling.,15
1138,Children are definitely not rational but love to be treated they were.,15
1139,How is this possible?,15
1140,Apparently they like having things explained to them without understanding either the explanation or even what an explanation is.,15
1141,Perhaps he just means that they like the sound of my voice?,15
1142,"Well, maybe they do, but making any old noises is clearly not sufficient to enter the rationality stakes; I must something.",15
1143,Is it just that I talk to them that they love?,15
1144,"Maybe, but I can also, if I like, talk to my car, but yelling at it in the approved Basil Fawlty manner is hardly treating it as rational.",15
1145,"Lockean children have the added  amazing ability to recognise reason in you without possessing any themselves, while Kantian kids, two stages back from rationality, have the disconcerting habit of getting puzzled and asking questions.",15
1146,Mill's minors are more complicated.,15
1147,Part of the time he sees them in the familiar way as creatures who lack rationality to some degree.,15
1148,But in the disclaimer his children need above all to be protected from the ghastly consequences of their own actions.,15
1149,"Their problem seems to be not one of the inability to choose goals or to form strategies for achieving them, but an incorrigible propensity to choose the wrong ones and an awesome efficiency in achieving them unless adults intervene.",15
1150,"All in all, it is a pretty unconvincing picture.",15
1151,"If you say that children are completely non-rational then you have to account for the fact that they become rational, and to do that it appears from these examples that you have to assume that they already are.",15
1152,"If, on the other hand, you allow rationality to children, then you cannot use their lack of it as a criterion to distinguish them from adults.",15
1153,Hobbes .,15
1154,"are not aware of the unreality of their original pictures which is why, often in the same sentence, they produce these contradictions.",15
1155,The one thing they do not do is to re-examine the original for the tell-tale signs of forgery.,15
1156,ILLEGITIMATE INFERENCES,15
1157,"The recognition that children cannot simply be written off in the rationality stakes and cannot therefore be denied autonomy on this account has led some writers to conclude that they cannot, therefore, be denied it on any account.",15
1158,"We should notice that this view is not just a flight of fancy from the loony left, the pederast lobby or children themselves.",15
1159,It is also to be found in stronger or weaker versions of more cautious academic thought.,15
1160,"In (1974), John Holt notes that children are, in fact, capable of more than modern society allows them to be.",15
1161,"He sees childhood as a fairly modern invention designed to fit adult children's needs, and an oppressive invention at that.",15
1162,"He suggests that children should be given a comprehensive range of civil and legal rights including the right to vote, to manage their own financial affairs, to direct and manage their own education and to control their own sex lives and ",15
1163,"to make and enter into, on a basis of mutual consent, quasifamilial relationships outside one's immediate family — i.e. the right to seek and choose guardians one's own parents and to be legally dependent on them.",15
1164,"(Holt, 1974, p. 16)",15
1165,"This is also the view put forward by John Harris, though in less specific terms.",15
1166,"Like Holt, Harris believes that the so-called incompetence of children is an adult invention imposed on children for adults' convenience.",15
1167,"He makes a firm proposal that the age of majority should be gradually reduced to 10 years, and remarks:",15
1168,"We must remember that to deny someone control of their own lives is to offer them a most profound insult, not to mention the injury which the frustration of their wishes and the setting at naught of their own plans for themselves will add.",15
1169,Perhaps we should conduct annual examinations from an early age to be sure that we do as little of this sort of damage as possible?,15
1170,"(Harris, 1982, p. 49)",15
1171,"Now Holt and Harris both have many wise, enlightened and humane observations to make about some of the injustices which we inflict upon children, but as these remarks show, putting them right without inflicting equally grave injustice is no easy matter.",15
1172,"Both of them appear to suffer from a form of mental myopia in imagining the consequences of such proposals, and I am not here referring only to Mill-type consequences of harm brought about by unwise decisions.",15
1173,"What, we may ask Holt, happens to the child who, dissatisfied at home, seeks for guardians who would suit him?",15
1174,What if wants him?,15
1175,Our papers are currently full of ‘hard-to-place’ children in local authority care advertising for foster or adoptive parents.,15
1176,In such a situation the skilled care of social workers is crucial to ensuring that an unwanted by-product of success for some children is not the total destruction of self-esteem for others.,15
1177,"What, we may ask Harris, happens to the child who repeatedly fails his annual examination?",15
1178,"To impose such a test on children would be a particularly invidious way of discriminating against them, unless Harris has in mind that we should all undergo such examination.",15
1179,He might then be open to bitter objections from many adults.,15
1180,"These two suggestions, far from being enlightened liberation of all children, are actually oppression of a deeply damaging kind to some, and Harris's suggestion contains a capacity criterion in disguise.",15
1181,"In any case, it would be dishonest to pretend that Mill-type consequences are not relevant here.",15
1182,Suppose Holt's 6-year-old does opt school?,15
1183,What happens to her then?,15
1184,What happens if her father is unwilling or unable to stay at home with her?,15
1185,Is it any better to oblige her to go abseiling or butterfly-catching instead?,15
1186,"However much she may enjoy such pursuits, there will be times when she would actually rather wander the streets unaccompanied.",15
1187,"Holt is presumably not volunteering himself to take care of her, who will?",15
1188,His view that letting children run in and busy airports smartly avoiding the traffic is perfectly reasonable depends upon a conception of a child which is far narrower than even the sex divide.,15
1189,"Holt's child is actually the Artful Dodger; mercifully, not all children are.",15
1190,There are other difficulties too.,15
1191,"It is not clear Harris thinks that children of 10 should be obliged to take on full political status they want to, but Holt clearly does not.",15
1192,"He proposes that ‘the rights, privileges, duties, responsibilities of adult citizens be made to any young person, of whatever age, who wants to make use of them’(Holt, 1974, p. 15).",15
1193,"If Holt thinks that this proposal would remove an arbitrary boundary line between adults and children, then he is mistaken.",15
1194,"The point about an adult citizen is that he has these rights, privileges, duties and responsibilities he wants them.",15
1195,"He may not exercise his rights or he may shirk his duties, but he cannot forgo them.",15
1196,"They are not just to him, they are his.",15
1197,That is what being a citizen involves.,15
1198,Rights and privileges do not pose any particular problems in the case of children.,15
1199,"Holt can and does believe that children should have them as adults do, and then leaves it the child to decide to exercise them.",15
1200,But the same cannot be said for duties and responsibilities.,15
1201,Failure to exercise one's rights may be morally neutral; failure to carry out one's duties is not.,15
1202,"It would be perfectly possible to give the rights to children without imposing the duties on them, the one does not entail the other, but we would then still be distinguishing between adults and children as citizens.",15
1203,Children still would not have full political status.,15
1204,Duties and responsibilities are not merely to a citizen; they are an integral part of being a citizen.,15
1205,Holt does not want children to be obliged to take on any of these responsibilities  and he manages to make his point by concentrating solely on the rights he can remark:,15
1206,"I do not say, either, that these rights and duties should be tied into one package, that if a young person wants to assume any of them, he must assume them all.",15
1207,He should be able to pick and choose.,15
1208,"(Holt, 1974, p. 16)",15
1209,"If he can ‘pick and choose’, I suggest, he is not a citizen, he does not have full political status and he is quite distinguishable on these grounds alone from the adults around him who do not have this option.",15
1210,"Holt and Harris both, in the end, face the same problem.",15
1211,"They attack the by pointing out that the reasons given for denying rights to children are reasons, and then explicitly or implicitly deny them duties for no reason .",15
1212,"Whatever else such a strategy may achieve, it certainly does not manage to produce a situation in which children are politically indistinguishable from adults and it rests on premises which, unless they can be defended, gain nothing for any defence to the charge of arbitrariness.",15
1213,"WHEN IN DOUBT, GO BACK TO ARISTOTLE",15
1214,The trouble with all the views which we have looked at is that they tie the notion of autonomy firmly and solely to that of knowledge interpreted in either a broad or narrow sense.,15
1215,That it is firmly tied must be correct; the inhabitants of Brave New World are not autonomous precisely because they are denied access to relevant information.,15
1216,Relevant knowledge is a precondition of autonomy but it is not synonymous with it.,15
1217,Aristotle said something very interesting in that extract from the which I quoted earlier; he said that women have a deliberative faculty but that it lacks full authority.,15
1218,What did he mean?,15
1219,What he did not mean is that women lack rationality; they can and do deliberate.,15
1220,At first sight what he seems to be saying is simply that is going to take any notice of the conclusions which a rational woman reaches after deliberation.,15
1221,"On further reflection, I think this is exactly what he is saying, and its significance is immense.",15
1222,His  view is that the judgements which women make have no standing.,15
1223,"Keeping to the domestic front for the moment, what this means is that the conclusions which women reach, carefully and intelligently they are worked out, can never have the status of decisions.",15
1224,"You cannot decide, though you may desire, to divorce your husband if the law does not allow; you cannot order the wine if only his signature makes the order legitimate.",15
1225,And your inability to decide or to order has nothing to do with your mental powers.,15
1226,But Aristotle is not just making a sociological point about what is and is not permitted to women in his society.,15
1227,His remark goes deeper than that.,15
1228,"It refers not to power but to authority, and what I think he means is that although a woman can make good and wise judgements, she cannot be the arbiter of that goodness or wisdom.",15
1229,"For that she needs the ratification of men, and that is enough to conclude that her judgements lack authority.",15
1230,"Now that is quite different from saying that women always make judgements, , that they suffer from some deficiency of rationality.",15
1231,Aristotle only produces spurious suggestions about a woman's incapacity to think or to stick to principles when he is obliged to say something about their judgements lack authority.,15
1232,It then looks the argument runs:,15
1233,(1) Women lack some moral or cognitive capacity therefore (2) Women (must) lack authority.,15
1234,In truth this version is the argument on its head; its real form is:,15
1235,(1) Women lack authority therefore (2) Women (must) lack some moral or cognitive capacity.,15
1236,"The important point here is that Aristotle's women are not autonomous, not because they lack abilities or capacities but because they lack authority; , their right to make decisions, to speak for themselves is not acknowledged.",15
1237,"This acknowledgement is absolutely essential, for without it no mental act which they perform, however well, will count as a decision .",15
1238,"The point I am making here is based on an observation by Stanley Cavell (1979, p. 460) and repeated by him in many contexts: ‘a human being could not fail to know, confronting me, that I am a human being’.",15
1239,Why not?,15
1240,Because to see someone is to see them as a human being and to see them as a human being is to acknowledge them as such.,15
1241,"This acknowledgement is not derived from a prior knowledge of facts, rather it is a precondition of there being any  facts.",15
1242,"We do not, on the Cavell model, first discover certain truths about an object and then conclude that it is a person; we first acknowledge the person and only inquire into facts later if necessary.",15
1243,"The point was put graphically by my colleague, Ian Ground.",15
1244,"Faced with a row of objects we do not, he said, lampooning Wittgenstein, perform appropriately by pointing to one after the other saying that's a tree, that's a tree, that's a man, that's a tree.",15
1245,"Rather we will say (pointing) that's a tree,(pointing) that's a tree,(waving) hello!(pointing) that's a tree.",15
1246,"What makes us the man is not an albeit swift chain of inference, it is his presence which commands the acknowledgement while the presence of the tree does no such thing.",15
1247,", if the man is clearly carved from stone then pointing is in order, and if we subsequently discover that ‘he’ is an inflatable rubber doll we are suitably embarrassed.",15
1248,But we are embarrassed because we got it wrong when usually we do not.,15
1249,In our viewing of the other we see ourselves being viewed; the recognition is mutual.,15
1250,How then is it possible to withhold acknowledgement?,15
1251,Cavell's answer is that it is not.,15
1252,There is no way of seeing another human being except as another human being.,15
1253,In a poignant discussion of the hypothesis that Southern slave owners did not see their slaves as human beings he disagrees:,15
1254,"When he wants to be served at table by a black hand, he would not be satisfied to be served by a black paw…",15
1255,"Everything in his relation to his slaves shows that he treats them as more or less human — his humiliations of them, his disappointments, his jealousies, his fears, his punishments, his attachments.",15
1256,"(Cavell, 1979, p. 376)",15
1257,"Treating people they were not people is not a possibility; to try to do so requires all the resources of evil which the human mind can muster, but it always breaks down.",15
1258,What is possible is to treat people as more or less human.,15
1259,We can withhold acknowledgement from them on limited or selective fronts.,15
1260,"This may not be downright evil, but in the absence of potential disbarments (like possibly being a rubber doll) it requires a considerable amount of bad faith.",15
1261,It is very to do.,15
1262,This is what Aristotle appears to do to his women.,15
1263,"They are human, and are acknowledged to be, they can think but they are not to be acknowledged as authoritative, and if their presence demands such  acknowledgement, they are bad women who should have been taught to hide or repress such demands.",15
1264,"Rousseau's blueprint for the education of Sophie is directed at this end, and if it is truly successful, she will internalise the lesson until neither her behaviour nor her demeanour will demand the acknowledgement.",15
1265,Then she has been infantilised and she is autonomous.,15
1266,But Rousseau's blueprint contains its own contradiction.,15
1267,"If you need to teach people or compel them in some other way to repress their natural demand for acknowledgement as rational, competent, authoritative human beings then you have no answer to the charge of some malefaction between bad faith and dreadful wickedness.",15
1268,Is this unfair to children?,15
1269,"When we deny autonomy to our 10-year-old, are we too guilty of bad faith?",15
1270,What reason could we produce to allow that she may have the capacity to act autonomously while denying her the capacity-to-act-autonomously?,15
1271,"Whatever it is we should first notice that while the capacity to act autonomously is construed as a psychological capacity, the capacity-to-act-autonomously is not.",15
1272,It is a social capacity which depends upon the acknowledgement of others.,15
1273,"What we need to do is to show that withholding this acknowledgement is neither arbitrary nor unjust; we have to ask, does her being demand it.",15
1274,CARRYING THE CAN,15
1275,To do this we need to consider another element in the picture of autonomy which was so meticulously side-stepped by Holt.,15
1276,", the matter of responsibility.",15
1277,"In (1974, p. 19) Strawson talks not of a child's emerging autonomy but of ‘the progressive emergence of the child as a responsible being’.",15
1278,Responsibility is an aspect of autonomy to which lip-service is commonly paid but which takes a back seat in most discussions about children.,15
1279,I believe it to be central.,15
1280,"In his essay, ‘In Defense of Anarchism’(1970), R. P. Wolff does give responsibility a central place in his brief analysis of autonomy.",15
1281,He argues that freedom of choice makes a man responsible for his actions while the capacity to reason about those choices places him under a continuing obligation to responsibility for those actions.,15
1282,To responsibility is to accept the duty of deciding for oneself what is right.,15
1283,"A man, Wolff argues, can forfeit his autonomy by not  the responsibility on himself; by, , obeying commands blindly; but he cannot abnegate the responsibility which the possibility of choice confers upon him.",15
1284,"Since being autonomous includes both freedom of choice and the capacity to reason about those choices, the impairment of either is a bar to autonomy.",15
1285,Against this background he makes two remarks about children:,15
1286,"It is quite appropriate that moral philosophers should group together children and madmen as beings not fully responsible for their actions, for as madmen are thought to lack freedom of choice, so children do not yet possess the power of reason in a developed form.",15
1287,"It is even just that we should assign a greater degree of responsibility to children, for madmen, by virtue of their lack of free will, are completely without responsibility, while children, they possess reason in a partially developed form, can be held responsible (i.e. can be required to take responsibility) to a corresponding degree.",15
1288,"(Wolff, 1970, pp. 12–13)",15
1289,"All men refuse to take responsibility for their actions at some time or other during their lives, and some men so consistently shirk their duty that they present more the appearance of overgrown children than of adults.",15
1290,"(Ibid., p. 14)",15
1291,"There is a striking similarity between Wolff's way of talking about children and the views we saw put forward by Hobbes, Locke and Kant.",15
1292,"Wolff begins with the assurance that children are not rational and then immediately back-pedals to say that actually they are, partially .",15
1293,"Four paragraphs later where the second quotation appears, the child is not unable to take responsibility but is refusing to take it.",15
1294,She is not an incompetent but a degenerate.,15
1295,"Having denied that she is incompetent, I am certainly not going to concede that the only alternative is to make her a degenerate; there must be another choice available.",15
1296,"What is missing from Wolff's analysis, though it is present in his terminology, is the recognition of the public face, the mutuality of responsibility.",15
1297,"He talks of responsibility to children,them responsible,them to take responsibility and these are natural ways of speaking.",15
1298,What they do is to introduce a new element into the concept of responsibility which involves more than free will and reason; now a third party is present and is an  active participant in the language game in which responsibility has a role.,15
1299,"People are not only responsible something, they are responsible God, other individuals, society or themselves, and this latter Kantian notion is derived from the primary social context in which it makes sense for the concept of responsibility to be invoked.",15
1300,This is just what I was claiming for authority.,15
1301,To say either that someone acts authoritatively or that someone is responsible for his actions may depend upon the possibility of ascribing mental states or capacities but neither is merely a shorthand way of ascribing them.,15
1302,"In the case of the fully autonomous person, authority and responsibility go hand in hand.",15
1303,The capacity-to-act-autonomously the coming together of the two.,15
1304,"If both or either is impaired then so is this capacity, and both depend upon the psychological capacities of the agent the recognition of other members of the moral and political community.",15
1305,This raises a difficulty.,15
1306,PASSING THE BUCK,15
1307,"The problem here seems to be this: am I saying that a child is responsible if and only if we declare her to be so, she knows what she is doing?",15
1308,This view has some historical clout.,15
1309,Given the knowledge it is always possible to hold someone responsible for their actions.,15
1310,Children were still being imprisoned and deported when Mill wrote that disclaimer.,15
1311,"Is it then just a matter of fashion, of the times in which we live?",15
1312,Not entirely; to begin with we might take a pragmatic line new knowledge about the long-term effects of such treatment on a child's subsequent development.,15
1313,"We might argue that while we hold her responsible, the consequences of so doing turn out to be unacceptable.",15
1314,But the horror which writers Dickens expressed at the cruelty of his times was prompted by no such knowledge.,15
1315,Dickensian child victims grow into upright citizens if they grow up .,15
1316,"What Dickens saw was what most of us see, the of treating a child in certain ways.",15
1317,In what does the inhumanity consist?,15
1318,"Not just in harsh action; increased concern about children is almost always part of a larger concern about people , but when horrible things are happening to people it is not unusual to focus on children and try special pleading on their behalf.",15
1319,"This special pleading is, , partly emotional but it might very well include reference to  children's lack of knowledge and understanding.",15
1320,Yet the inhumanity does not consist in the ascription of certain cognitive states either.,15
1321,We may be quite right to ascribe agency to a child for his acts.,15
1322,The inhumanity seems to lie in allowing the full weight of responsibility to fall on the child.,15
1323,Responsibility is not only about agency.,15
1324,"‘When we say a person is responsible for what he does we mean not just that he was the agent…we also say that the act reflects (back) on the agent,’ writes David Wood (1973, p. 191).",15
1325,"How much reflecting goes on depends upon the reflective capabilities of the child and also on the strength and direction of the beam which we, the adults, determine.",15
1326,Perhaps now we can take Mill's insight without opening ourselves to the charge of arbitrariness.,15
1327,Mill wanted to protect children against the harm which they might do themselves.,15
1328,The problem which was supposed to bring liberal theory crashing to the ground was that we do not wish to justify interfering with adult liberties on these grounds.,15
1329,"It may be that what we are protecting children from is not so much the awful consequences of their ignorant decisions but of the burden of responsibility for those decisions which children are not yet ready to bear and which, for entirely non-political reasons, we cannot choose to impose upon them.",15
1330,"If giving or withholding this responsibility were possible options in a one-person game, then this criterion would do nothing to counter the charge of arbitrariness but I have already argued that they are not and could not be.",15
1331,"We can only at ascribing responsibility outside this mutual interaction; making the horse a senator, blaming the toy which the child trips over are games which do not fool the horse or the toy.",15
1332,"Growing up, maturing, emerging into autonomy is the process of the child taking from the adult more and more of the responsibility for those actions which she does knowingly.",15
1333,Respect for the dignity and freedom of the child consists in the recognition that the burden of responsibility shifts from the adult to the child as she herself demands it.,15
1334,We leave unhappy teenagers who ‘don't want to talk about it’ alone; the tearful 5-year-old comes and dumps the problem in your lap.,15
1335,", we say, we ‘play it by ear’ and what we listen for is the child's own claim to have its decisions treated as authoritative and to be ready to bear the responsibility.",15
1336,"This claim is not a conscious, spoken claim; if it gets to that stage, we have already left it too late.",15
1337,The claim is implicit in the child's own social interactions and unless we are blind or acting in chronic bad faith we  can do no acknowledge it.,15
1338,But neither can we impose it.,15
1339,"Holding a child responsible is not the same as making her responsible; we may succeed in the former, without her cooperation we can never succeed in the latter.",15
1340,"Now it can still be objected that this is also true of adults and that I have still, therefore, failed to distinguish them from children.",15
1341,"However, there is a difference.",15
1342,"With children, the presupposition is that we take the responsibility until they show us that they want it; with adults we assume that they take the responsibility unless they show us that they don't.",15
1343,(We are surprised when the ‘man’ turns out to be a robot.),15
1344,"That is what membership of the moral and political community is, and it is a serious business which deserves more attention than I can give here.",15
1345,"It is quite correct that children's application for membership should be taken seriously; once accepted there is no turning back, resignation is not an option.",15
1346,"To end, a word about voting.",15
1347,"Voting is not just a matter of knowing how to put a cross on a piece of paper, nor of having a rough or even quite refined view of the policies of the major political parties.",15
1348,"It also, in a democracy, involves being responsible to some degree for the society which we have.",15
1349,"Maybe ‘I didn't vote Tory’, but even that does not enable me to opt that responsibility entirely.",15
1350,Why else would I buy the sticker?,15
1351,Let us ask our 10-year-old's mother if her daughter is ready to take that responsibility.,15
1352,What would she say?,15
1353,"Perhaps that, yes, her child is intelligent and thoughtful and even knowledgeable; yes, she would be as competent as many adults in coming to sensible conclusions.",15
1354,"Also, perhaps, that sometimes at night, she finds her crying for the starving of Africa or unable to sleep with the terror of the possibility of nuclear war or desperately seeking a denial of the reality of the horror of the Holocaust.",15
1355,"Perhaps she would be angry if, by trying to impose responsibility on her daughter by giving her the vote, we were also taking from her the only comfort which she has, namely that when she is older she will change all that.",15
1356,Or perhaps she would just tell us that her child is not yet ready; she would be right.,15
1357,"Denying the vote to children is not based on some false assumption about 10-year-olds' political knowledge, nor to deny that they have interests, nor to protect them from the harm their votes might do.",15
1358,It is to take responsibility to ourselves for the way the world is.,15
1359,And that really does belong to us.,15

1361,Autonomy and Identity in Feminist Thinking,15
1362,Jean Grimshaw,15
1363,Issues about women's autonomy have been central to feminist thinking and action.,15
1364,Women have so often been in situations of powerlessness and dependence that any system of belief or programme of action that could count as ‘feminist’ must in some way see this as a central concern.,15
1365,But what is meant by ‘autonomy’ and under what conditions is it possible?,15
1366,This has been an important and contentious question in philosophy.,15
1367,"But questions about autonomy, and related questions about self and identity have also been important to feminism, and within feminist thinking it is possible to find radically different ways of thinking about these things.",15
1368,"In this paper, I want to look at one kind of way in which some feminists have tried to conceptualise what it is for a woman to be ‘autonomous’, and at the implications this has for ways of thinking about the human self.",15
1369,"I shall argue that this conception is not only philosophically problematic, but also has an implicit politics which is potentially damaging.",15
1370,"And I shall try to suggest some ways of beginning to think about ‘autonomy’ which seem to me to be more fruitful and adequate, and to draw on different traditions of thinking about the self which have become influential in some recent feminist thinking.",15
1371,"Feminist thinking does not, , exist in a vacuum, and in thinking about women's autonomy, feminists have drawn on different (and conflicting) approaches to questions about the human self, some of which have a long history.",15
1372,"I want to begin by going back to an argument that Aristotle put forward in the , since I think that the point at which his argument breaks down can illuminate the nature of the problem some feminist thinking has faced.",15
1373,"Aristotle's argument concerns the question of what it is that makes an action ‘voluntary’, done of a person's own free will, and  to answer this question, he distinguished between actions whose origin was ‘inside’ a person, and those whose origin was ‘outside’, which resulted from external influences or pressure or compulsion.",15
1374,"He discussed at some length the problems that arise over trying to define ideas ‘compulsion’, and in estimating the degree of severity of pressure that could make an action not voluntary.",15
1375,"But in this sort of model of autonomy, what defines an action as autonomous is seen as its point of ; it must have an ‘immaculate conception’, , from the self.",15
1376,"Now ultimately I think that it is this definition of ‘autonomy’ origin, and the associated distinction between an ‘inner’self which can in some way spontaneously generate its ‘own’actions, and ‘external’influences which are not ‘part’of the self, that will need challenging.",15
1377,"But I think it is possible to defend the Aristotelian version of autonomy a point, provided notions of ‘inside’ and ‘outside’the self are defined in a certain way.",15
1378,"If a person is prevented from doing what they would otherwise intend or desire to do, or if they are coerced into doing what they would otherwise want or desire to do, they are not acting autonomously.",15
1379,"Under this interpretation, actions which originate from ‘inside’ the self are those which are seen as conscious desires or intentions, and those which originate from ‘outside’the self are those which one would not do if one were not coerced.",15
1380,"The pressure here is to consider the sorts of circumstances which do, in fact, coerce people in these sorts of ways.",15
1381,"And, , a central concern of feminism has been to identify and fight against the kinds of coercion to which women have been subjected, including things like physical violence and economic dependence.",15
1382,But it is at this point that an Aristotelian-type argument fails to be able to deal with the most difficult questions about autonomy.,15
1383,"The Aristotelian view, as I have interpreted it, ‘works’ only to the extent that it is assumed that there is no problem about what I shall call ‘the autonomy of desires’.",15
1384,Autonomy is defined as acting desire (or intention).,15
1385,But what of the desires themselves?,15
1386,"Are there (or intentions) which are not ‘autonomous’, which do not originate from ‘within’ the self, which are not authentic, not really ‘one's own’?",15
1387,"Feminist writers have wanted, , to indict the various forms of brutality and coercion from which women have suffered.",15
1388,"But this brutality and coercion has been seen not merely as a question of physical or ‘external’ coercion or constraint; the force of  subjection has also been seen as a psychic one, invading women's very selves.",15
1389,"The language of ‘conditioning’, ‘brainwashing’, ‘indoctrination’, , has been used to describe this force.",15
1390,"The female self, under male domination, is riddled through and through with false or conditioned desires.",15
1391,"But set against this conditioned, non-autonomous female self are various images of a female self that would be authentic, that would transcend or shatter this conditioning.",15
1392,"I want now to look at some of these images of the female self in feminist discourse: my particular examples are from the work of Mary Daly, Marilyn Frye and Kate Millett.",15
1393,"Daly, Frye and Millett all stress the way in which women have been the of men.",15
1394,"Much of Daly's book,(1979), is an account of the barbarities inflicted on women suttee, clitorectomy, foot-binding and other forms of mutilation.",15
1395,"Millett, in (1977), sees patriarchal power as something so historically all-embracing that it has totally dominated women's lives.",15
1396,"Frye, in (1983), uses the situation of a young girl sold into sexual slavery and then systematically brutalised and brainwashed into a life of service to her captors as an analogy for the situation of all women.",15
1397,And all three writers stress the way in which they see the female self as ‘invaded’ by patriarchal conditioning.,15
1398,Millett writes:,15
1399,"When, in any group of persons, the ego is subjected to such invidious versions of itself through social beliefs, ideology and tradition, the effect is bound to be pernicious.",15
1400,This should make it no very special cause for surprise that women develop group characteristics common to those who suffer minority status and a marginal existence.,15
1401,"(Millett, 1977, p. 55)",15
1402,"Women, she argues, are deprived of all but the most trivial sources of dignity or self-respect.",15
1403,"In her discussion of Lawrence's depiction of Connie in , what she sees Connie as relinquishing is ‘self, ego, will, individuality’(p. 243); all those things which, Millett argues, women had but recently achieved,(and for which Lawrence had a profound distaste).",15
1404,Mary Daly's picture of the way in which women's selves are invaded by patriarchal conditioning is even more striking.,15
1405,"She describes women, , as ‘moronised’, ‘robotised’, ‘lobotomised’, as ‘the puppets of Papa’.",15
1406,"At times she seems to see women as so ‘brainwashed’ that they are scarcely human; thus she  describes them as ‘fembots’, even as ‘mutants’.",15
1407,"In Millett, Daly and Frye, women are seen primarily as : the monolithic brutality and psychological pressures of male power have reduced women almost to the state of being ‘non-persons’.",15
1408,"And indeed, as Daly sees women as having become ‘mutants’ or ‘fembots’, so Millett sees them as not having been allowed to participate in fully ‘human’activities (which she characterises as those that are most remote from the biological contingencies of life), and Frye sees them as simply ‘broken’and then ‘remade’in the way that suits their masters.",15
1409,"But behind this victimised female self, whose actions and desires are assumed to be not truly ‘her own’, since they derive from processes of force, conditioning or psychological manipulation, there is seen to be an authentic female self, whose recovery or discovery it is one of the aims of feminism to achieve.",15
1410,"The spatial metaphor implicit in the word ‘behind’ is not accidental, since this model of self is premised on the possibility of making a distinction between an ‘inner’and an ‘outer’self.",15
1411,"Ibsen's Peer Gynt compared his quest for identity to the process of peeling layers off an onion; but after shedding all the ‘false selves’, he found that there was nothing inside, no ‘core’.",15
1412,"The sort of spatial metaphor implicit in Peer Gynt's account of himself is also apt in the accounts of self given by Daly, Millett and Frye, there is assumed to be a ‘core’.",15
1413,This is clearest in the work of Daly.,15
1414,"In , discovering or recovering one's own self is seen as akin to a process of salvation or religious rebirth, and Daly writes of what she calls the unveiling or unwinding of the ‘shrouds’ of patriarchy to reveal the authentic female Spirit-Self underneath.",15
1415,And this Self is seen as a unitary and harmonious one.,15
1416,"Splits and barriers within the psyche, she argues, those between Selves, are the result of patriarchal conditioning.",15
1417,In the unitary and harmonious female Spirit-Self there will be no such splits.,15
1418,Millett's picture of the authentic female self is rather different from that of Daly.,15
1419,"It does not draw, as Daly's does, on religious metaphors of salvation and rebirth.",15
1420,"It derives, rather, from a picture of the self as fundamentally a unitary, conscious and rational thing, a picture which, in Western philosophy, can be traced back to Descartes.",15
1421,It emerges most clearly in her discussion of Freud.,15
1422,"She describes Freud's theory of the Unconscious as a major contribution to human understanding, but her account of the self owes, in fact, scarcely anything to Freud.",15
1423,"She is scathingly critical of Freud's  theory of penis envy: Freud, she argued, ‘did not accept his patient's symptoms as evidence of a justified dissatisfaction with the limiting circumstances imposed on them by society, but as symptomatic of an independent and universal feminine tendency’(Millett, 1977, p. 179).",15
1424,He made a major (and foolish) confusion between biology and culture.,15
1425,"Girls, Millett argues, are fully cognisant of male supremacy long before they see their brother's penis; and what they envy is not the penis, but the things to which having a penis gives the boy access — power, status and rewards.",15
1426,"Freud ignored the more likely ‘social’ hypothesis for feminine dissatisfaction, preferring to ascribe it to a biologically based female nature.",15
1427,"What we should be studying, Millett argues, are the effects of male-supremacist culture on the female ego.",15
1428,"And what will undo these effects, she writes in the Postscript, is altered consciousness, and a process of ‘human growth and tru",15
1429,"The ‘social’ factors of which Millett writes are here seen as pressures which are ‘external’to the self, and which have the effect of thwarting the conscious and unitary rationality of female individuality, or the female ego.",15
1430,And the task is that of their influence.,15
1431,"If, in , the scales were to fall from Connie's eyes and she were to see the worship of Mellor's phallus for what it is, a means of subordinating and oppressing women, she could free herself and develop her authentic will, ego and individuality.",15
1432,"The paradigm of coercion, writes Frye, is the direct application of physical force.",15
1433,"Rather, it is a situation in which choice and action take place, and in which the victim acts under her own perception and judgement.",15
1434,"Hence, what the exploiter needs is that",15
1435,the will and intelligence of the victim be disengaged from the projects of resistance and escape but that they not be simply broken or destroyed.,15
1436,"Ideally, the disintegration and misintegration of the victim should accomplish the detachment of the victim's will and intelligence from the victim's own interests and their attachment to the interests of the exploiter.",15
1437,This will effect a displacement or dissolution of self-respect and will undermine the victim's intolerance of coercion.,15
1438,"With that, the situation transcends the initial paradigmatic form or structure of coercion; for if people don't mind doing what you want them to do, you can't really be them do it.",15
1439,"(Frye, 1983, p. 60)",15
1440,"And, she writes:",15
1441,The health and integrity of an organism is a matter of its being organised largely towards its own interests and welfare.,15
1442,is healthy and ‘working right’ when her substance is organised primarily on principles which align it to interests and welfare.,15
1443,"Co-operation is essential , but it will not do that I arrange everything you get enough exercise: for me to be healthy, I must get enough exercise.",15
1444,My being adequately exercised is logically independent of your being so.,15
1445,"(Ibid., p. 70)",15
1446,"Frye is writing here it were possible to distinguish the interests of one self sharply from those of another, and , were the effects of male domination to be undone, it would not be too much of a problem for the self to know what its interests were.",15
1447,"In various ways then, underlying much of the work of these three writers is a set of assumptions about the self.",15
1448,"First, that it is, potentially, a unitary, rational thing, aware of its interests.",15
1449,"Second, that ‘splits’ within the psyche should be seen as resulting from the interference of patriarchal or male-dominated socialisation or conditioning.",15
1450,"Third, that the task of undoing this conditioning is one that can be achieved solely by a rational process of learning to understand and fight against the social and institutional effects of male domination.",15
1451,"And implicit in these assumptions about the self, I think, is a conception of autonomy.",15
1452,Frye writes that ‘left to themselves’ women would not want to serve men.,15
1453,Daly writes of unveiling or unwinding the ‘shrouds’ of patriarchy.,15
1454,Millett writes of the individuality and ego that women can discover in themselves once they recognise the effects of their patriarchal socialisation.,15
1455,"And in all three, what is autonomous (or authentic) is what is seen as originating in some way from the self; what is in some way by the conditioning or manipulation to which a woman has previously been subjected.",15
1456,"Before I come to discuss the philosophical problems that are raised by this sort of account of self and autonomy, I want to look at what I have called its implicit politics; and what I mean by this primarily is its possible consequences for the way in which women might think about their relationships to , and the way in which they might think about themselves.",15
1457,The first consequence seems to me to be this.,15
1458,"Any view which sees self-affirmation  an ‘authentic’ inner self arising from the smashing of a socially conditioned ‘false self’, or which sees autonomy as a question of the origin of actions from ‘inside’‘outside’, is almost bound to adopt, however implicitly, a derogatory attitude towards those who are not yet ‘authentic’.",15
1459,The precise nature and tone of this attitude may vary.,15
1460,"But Mary Daly, , in , sometimes writes most women were really little more than the programmed, robotic puppets to which women were reduced in Ira Levin's novel ; the language of ‘fembots’ and ‘mutants’and ‘puppets’, whilst intended, I am sure, to enunciate a critique of women's oppressors, veers perilously sounding like contempt for those who are that oppression.",15
1461,"And this is related, , to Daly's scorn for ‘tokenism’— for those women who participate in what are seen as patriarchal institutions.",15
1462,Kate Millett's language is less obviously extreme.,15
1463,But the picture she paints of women is nevertheless often a derogatory one.,15
1464,"She describes them, , as ‘infantilised’; she accepts without question research which purported to show that most women despised (Millett, 1977, p. 55); she sees women as having little ‘self-respect’, and as devoting almost all their time and attention to pleasing and flattering men.",15
1465,"This implicitly derogatory attitude to women is linked both to an overmonolithic account of male power, and to a failure to give much attention to the ways in which women have, in fact, often spent much of their lives, and to the activities which have been particularly theirs (the rearing of children, ).",15
1466,"Sometimes women are depicted almost as a caricature of a male stereotype of themselves — they servile, weak, powerless etc.",15
1467,(Millett even suggests (p. 56) that the fact that women commit less ‘crime’ than men is their patriarchal conditioning in passivity.),15
1468,"Millett basically dismisses the activities which have tended to dominate women's lives as ‘infantilising’, because they restrict women to the level, she argues, of the merely biological, and do not allow them to enter upon the ‘fully human’ activities which have been the province of men.",15
1469,"And it is interesting, as Toril Moi (1985) points out, that in her discussion of literature, Millett concentrates almost wholly on male authors, with the exception of Charlotte Bronte, of whose work she tends to be very dismissive.",15
1470,"Furthermore, as Moi suggests, she seems to avoid much in the way of recognition or acknowledgement of feminist work her own, or of the existence of female traditions and strengths which  might have tended to challenge or subvert the supposedly monolithic nature of the male power which it is the main aim of her book to describe.",15
1471,"Mary Daly's indictment of male power and brutality similarly allows little space for a consideration of the patterns of women's lives, or the strengths and capacities that these might have enabled them to develop.",15
1472,Her female Spirit-Self simply seems to rise mysteriously like a phoenix from the ashes of patriarchal conditioning.,15
1473,"And Frye is sceptical about the possibility of women looking to their foremothers as a source of inspiration; of seeing some women, , as having led lives that were not wholly male-mediated.",15
1474,Feminist vision or imagination has no real resource to turn to.,15
1475,Now these kinds of accounts (or perhaps one might say to give an adequate account?) of women's lives are implicitly divisive and threatening.,15
1476,They are divisive because they have a tendency to divide women into two camps; those who have and those who have not shaken the dust of patriarchal conditioning from their feet.,15
1477,"And they are threatening, because it is offensive and undermining to be told that the life one has led has merely been one of servility, that it has not been of truly ‘human’ value, that one has been a ‘fembot’or a ‘puppet’.",15
1478,"I think that one important strand in the rejection of feminism by many women has been a feeling that feminists are saying that their lives have been of no value, and that their activities and concerns have been trivial.",15
1479,"But this image of autonomy and of the self can be threatening, too, to women who have a strong allegiance to feminism; and the threat intersects with assumptions that have been made in some feminist discourse about who is or is not ‘really’ a feminist.",15
1480,The threat arises because this account of autonomy is in fact often a strongly one; it presents an image of what a ‘feminist self’ should be like.,15
1481,"To be autonomous or authentic one should be strong, independent, rational, coherent or consistent, able to distinguish clearly those aspects of one's previous self which derive from male-dominated conditioning and reject them.",15
1482,"If one is ambivalent, conflicted, uncertain, confused, unwilling to make wholesale rejections, one stands to be accused, whether by oneself or by others, of bad faith, of lack of courage, of ‘selling out’, of tokenism.",15
1483,I am here giving an account of just one (influential) strand in feminist discourse.,15
1484,There are other strands which have rejected this account of self and autonomy.,15
1485,"As I have said before, a picture of the  self as conscious, unitary and rational can be traced back, in Western philosophy, to Descartes.",15
1486,"I do not have space here to discuss the various ways in which versions of this conception of self have been influential, in philosophy and psychology, .",15
1487,But the major tradition which has queried this view of self has been that which derives from psychoanalysis.,15
1488,Feminism has had a complex relation to psychoanalysis.,15
1489,Freud's theories have been the target of a great deal of feminist criticism.,15
1490,"In , , Kate Millett sees Freud simply as the proponent of a biologistic theory of male supremacy, and as one of the arch-villains in the male plot of patriarchy.",15
1491,"Other feminist writers, however, have tried to reevaluate the significance of psychoanalytic theory for feminism.",15
1492,"And they have argued that, whilst feminism should indeed always have a critical relationship to psychoanalytic theory, the latter has within it the potential for allowing a better understanding of the complexities of human desires and of the psychological construction of ‘masculinity’ and ‘femininity’.",15
1493,"Now any adequate account of self needs to be able, I think, to encompass and try to make intelligible the ways in which women and men experience themselves.",15
1494,"And the central reasons for rejecting the ‘humanist’ paradigm of the self — as I have outlined it above — are, firstly, that there may be aspects of the development of self which are not easily accessible to consciousness, and secondly, that there are conscious experiences which are not easy to make intelligible within the humanist paradigm.",15
1495,"I want now to look at some aspects of self-experience that I think should be central to any theory of self, and hence to any discussion of women's autonomy.",15
1496,Fantasy,15
1497,"The dream (on which we may try hard to impose a narrative structure, to make sense of it) is unlike much fantasy in that it often doesn't, of itself, contain any such structure, and the ‘story’, if it tells one, may be deeply unintelligible to us.",15
1498,"Much conscious fantasy is different; we may ‘tell a story’ to ourselves (or listen to a story and fantasise it as about ourselves); and sometimes we may attempt an imagined resolution, through fantasy, of some aspect of our social situation.",15
1499,"One might, thus, fantasise the death of someone seen as a threat, or imagine oneself as possessing enormous fame or wealth.",15
1500,"But fantasies, not always in the form of a coherent narrative, may  irrupt or intervene; one can be plagued, dominated or obsessed by them.",15
1501,"Freud wrote of the way in which fantasies or desires, often seen as evil or dangerous, could come to dominate a person's life.",15
1502,"Fantasy may be a threat; it may be inexplicable, bizarre and intrusive.",15
1503,"Discovering the fantasies of others, too, may be threatening; the discovery, , as Rosalind Coward (1984) suggests, that the ‘mild’ man one lives with is a secret addict of sadomasochistic pornography.",15
1504,Female sexual fantasies can be disturbing .,15
1505,"Why do many women find erotic, and why is there a ‘split’ between sexual fantasy and that which one might find pleasurable or erotic in real life?",15
1506,Fantasy may be experienced both as pleasurable and as dangerous.,15
1507,But sometimes it can just be pleasurable.,15
1508,"Coward discusses, , the importance of the fact that one of the biggest growth areas in publishing in recent years has been women's romantic fiction.",15
1509,"Unlike the ‘modern’ women's novel in which, usually after a series of disastrous sexual misadventures, the female heroine ends up (more or less)‘her own person’, romantic fiction is stylised, formulaic and unrealistic.",15
1510,"It offers women, Coward argues, the fantasised pleasure (and apotheosis of sexual desire) of finding security in the strong arms of the hard-bitten patriarchal hero, the pleasure of having ‘tamed’ him and domesticated his wild ways by the power one enjoys over him in being a woman.",15
1511,We have to understand the pleasure there is for women in such fantasies.,15
1512,"We have to understand what seems often to attract women more than men to soap operas, or to a passionate interest in the doings of the Royal Family.",15
1513,"We need to understand how and why male fantasies may commonly differ from female ones, and why the sorts of fantasies I have mentioned, which may in some ways seem antithetical to feminism, may still have a strong appeal to women who have a feminist allegiance.",15
1514,The ‘Split’ Between Reason and Desire,15
1515,"I will suggest, as a first example of this, a book by Suzanne Lowry, on Princess Diana, called (1985).",15
1516,The appearance of the book is at first glance like that of any other glossy book about the Royals.,15
1517,"But it sets out, its author says, to deconstruct the image and appeal of the Princess.",15
1518,"At the end of the book, Lowry states that the image of the Princess is conformist and reactionary, that it acts as a powerful form of social control, and that Diana is an unwitting agent of that.",15
1519,"Yet the presentation of the book, and Lowry's text, often speak of a fascination with the Princess that is more than simply the fascination one can derive from the exercise of deconstructing an image.",15
1520,And this fascination is often in tension with the attempt to articulate a critique.,15
1521,Or think about the Fonda phenomenon.,15
1522,"The text of Fonda's book,(1984), exhorts women not to ‘think thin', and its theme is mainly that of health.",15
1523,Yet the illustrations are nearly all of women who are pencil-thin enough not to be place on the catwalk in a Paris fashion show.,15
1524,"The discourse of ‘health’ is almost inextricably intertwined, in the case of women, with discourse about youth and beauty and sexual attractiveness.",15
1525,The reasons women have for concern about fitness and health are often multiply overdetermined.,15
1526,"Notions, , of (Kenton, 1986)between discussions of how to preserve a youthful skin and a young-looking body and how to stave off the ravages of older, with discussions of mental vitality and energy, .",15
1527,A young-looking body is a of an alert mind.,15
1528,"There is a type of feminist criticism, both in literature and other media (and in fields education), which has been called ‘Images of Women’ criticism.",15
1529,"This has supposed that feminist effort should be devoted, first, to showing how the ‘images’ in question oppress or denigrate women, and second, to offering positive images of women to replace these.",15
1530,"One problem with this kind of criticism is that the ‘images’ in question have often been misinterpreted, since they have been discussed without reference to the context or narrative structure in which they may appear.",15
1531,But there are two other problems with this type of criticism which I want to focus on here.,15
1532,"First, what this approach often fails to recognise is the importance of understanding the of the ‘images’ that are criticised; the relations they may have to women's pleasures, desires, fantasies, fears and conceptions of themselves.",15
1533,"Second, it fails to recognise what is signally obvious in the experience of many women, myself included, namely that it is perfectly possible to agree ‘in one's head’ that certain images of women might be reactionary or damaging or oppressive, while remaining committed to them in emotion and desire.",15
1534,"I suspect that this ‘split’ happens at times in all women, and perhaps particularly in those who have some commitment to feminism.",15
1535,"And what it suggests is that structures of desire, emotion and fantasy have deep roots of  some sort in the self which are not necessarily amenable in any simple way to processes of conscious rational argument.",15
1536,An adequate theory of subjectivity has to recognise and try to understand these roots.,15
1537,Contradictions,15
1538,"I have already identified one type of contradiction; those that can exist between one's fantasies and what one would actually do or enjoy in real life, and those that can exist between one's understanding of the oppressive nature of some discourse or practice and one's continuing investment of desire and finding of pleasure in it.",15
1539,"In his (1973), Freud discussed the way in which symptoms are experienced in certain forms of obsessional neurosis.",15
1540,He wrote:,15
1541,"Obsessional neurosis is shown in the patient's being occupied with thoughts in which he is in fact not interested, in his being aware of impulses which appear very strange to him and his being led to actions the performance of which give him no enjoyment but which it is quite impossible for him to omit.",15
1542,"The thoughts (obsessions) may be senseless in themselves, or merely a matter of indifference to the subject; often they are completely silly, and invariably they are the starting-point of a strenuous mental activity, which exhausts the patient and to which he only surrenders himself most unwillingly.",15
1543,(p.297),15
1544,"Obsessional neurosis is characterised, Freud argued, by the fact that the symptoms are not only debilitating, but are experienced by the person as ; they do not seem ‘part’ of him or her, and they seem discrepant with an everyday or normal sense of the self.",15
1545,In the case of many of Freud's patients the disruption and debilitation caused by the symptoms was so extreme that they were scarcely able to carry on their lives adequately .,15
1546,"But Freud insisted that there was no sharp dividing line between ‘normal’ and ‘neurotic’people, and would have argued that similar, though less extreme, obsessions and apparently inexplicable compulsions can be found in all of us.",15
1547,"In these cases, the self is, , split against itself, desires and impulses that seem ‘character’.",15
1548,But one cannot assume that an everyday ‘coherent’ sense of self is  readily available.,15
1549,"One reason for this is that women (and men, ) are often faced with the problem of negotiating contradictory or conflicting conceptions of themselves.",15
1550,"Women may, , be required to be sexually exciting and available,modest and chaste.",15
1551,And gender relationships may be the problems that can arise from conflicting discourses about femininity or masculinity.,15
1552,"Men may, ,see themselves as ‘stronger’ than women and tend to see women as more weak and passive, but see women as having a power over them that can seem to engulf the man in forms of emotional dependence by which he may feel threatened.",15
1553,Discourse about femininity and masculinity is a homogeneous or stable thing.,15
1554,"In the twentieth century, the advent of a ‘consumer culture’ and of mass communications has given questions about self and identity a peculiar intensity and difficulty in some respects.",15
1555,"They have led, , to a focus on appearance and ‘style’, and the way in which these may ‘express’ one's individuality, that is historically novel.",15
1556,"The clothes one wears, the ‘room of one's own’ in the Sunday Supplements: one may, apparently, now ‘try on’identities they really were clothes.",15
1557,And women have often tended to be the main target of fashion and ‘lifestyle’ talk.,15
1558,"For all the rejection of what was sometimes called ‘woman garbage’ by American feminists, the issue of appearance is something that no woman can wholly avoid.",15
1559,"Feminists too, , have used style of dress and demeanour to express a sense of self and of political commitment.",15
1560,(Elizabeth Wilson recorded once realising that she was more than usually anxious about the question of what to wear when she was going to talk to a feminist group.),15
1561,Self-knowledge and Self-deception,15
1562,The concept of self-deception is one that has constantly puzzled philosophers.,15
1563,How can one both know and yet not know something about oneself.,15
1564,I do not have space here to discuss the question of self-deception in detail.,15
1565,But an important thing to recognise at the outset is that knowing about oneself can never be a matter of ‘mere information’.,15
1566,One cannot be distanced from or emotionally neutral about issues of self-knowledge.,15
1567,(Freud stressed this in his account of the transference in the analytic situation.),15
1568,Herbert Fingarette (1959) uses the concept of ‘avowal’ to give an account of the concept of  self-deception.,15
1569,We do not see everything that we think or do or fantasise or desire as equally ‘central’ to ourselves.,15
1570,"It is quite common, in everyday discourse, to say things like ‘I wasn't really myself’ or ‘It wasn't like to do that’.",15
1571,"Sometimes this process of rejection, of not avowing, is quite conscious.",15
1572,"At other times it may be barely admitted to consciousness, if whatever it was is seen as threatening to the self.",15
1573,"And sometimes it is, I think, not conscious .",15
1574,"Psychoanalysts have talked, , about the process of ‘projection’, in which aspects of oneself of which one is fearful may be projected other people.",15
1575,"(A number of writers have seen ‘projection’ as involved in the problem of masculinity, and have suggested that men may sometimes project their own fears of such things as emotional intimacy women, who are then seen as ‘bad’because they cause these problems.)",15
1576,Self-knowledge can never be a matter of easy or immediate introspection.,15
1577,"This is partly because aspects of oneself may be disavowed, sometimes unconsciously, and partly because the ‘meaning’ of the deliverances of introspection is always dependent on an interpretation.",15
1578,"One may be of feelings, sexual ones , that one is not able to conceptualise sexual at the time.",15
1579,"Freud believed that at the root of all neuroses lay repressed sexual desires, but one does not follow him in this, it would be hard to resist the conclusion that this was true of some of his patients.",15
1580,Sometimes his patients lacked the kind of knowledge that would have enabled them to interpret the experience as ‘sexual’ .,15
1581,"Sometimes they possessed knowledge about sex, but could not admit that was sexual, or that had those sorts of desires.",15
1582,"I have outlined above some of the experiences and the problems about subjectivity that any adequate theory of self must be able to encompass, in a way that the ‘humanist’ paradigm is, I think, unable to do.",15
1583,There are approaches to understanding and theorising self which depart radically from the humanist paradigm.,15
1584,"I shall not attempt to enumerate them all here, nor do I think that feminism should accept any of them uncritically.",15
1585,"What they share, despite their differences, is an insistence that there is no ‘original’ wholeness or unity in the self, nor a ‘real self’which can be thought of as in some way the self of everyday life.",15
1586,"The self is a more or less precarious and conflictual construction , and compromise between, conflicting and not always conscious desires and experiences, which are born the ambivalences  and contradictions in human experience and relationships with others.",15
1587,"Accounts of the construction of the self vary, in the degree of stress, , that they lay on the period of infancy and early childhood, and on the importance given to sexuality.",15
1588,But it seems to me that the theories of Freud must be seen as centrally important.,15
1589,"It is sometimes argued that Freud's theories must be accepted or rejected all of a piece, and that one cannot simply accept or reject ‘bits’ of them as one fancies.",15
1590,"It is true, I think, that there is a certain sort of eclecticism, practised by some neo-Freudian writers Erich Fromm or by the American ‘ego psychologists’, which may undermine anything useful that Freudian theory really has to offer.",15
1591,"But whatever we may take or reject from Freud, what I think we should not lose is the way in which he raises questions and problematises things which are sometimes taken for granted.",15
1592,"Freud questions any easy (or utopian) idea or ideal of the unity of the self, he questions the idea that self-knowledge could ever be a matter of simple introspection, and he sees issues about desire and fantasy as central to subjectivity.",15
1593,He stresses the way in which the acquisition of a subjectivity is necessarily conflictual and involves struggle.,15
1594,"And above all, perhaps, he forces a radical questioning of the concepts of the ‘individual’ and the ‘social’.",15
1595,Nothing could be further from the truth than Kate Millett's accusation that Freud believed that women's destiny was a simple outcome of their biology.,15
1596,"In Freudian theory, there is a constant concern with the way in which entry into culture and human relationships, and the conflicts and struggle this causes, should be seen as of the human self.",15
1597,Freud's particular view of human culture was problematic.,15
1598,"He stressed that psychoanalysis was never concerned solely with desires seen as arising unmediated from the body, but always with psychic representations of these.",15
1599,But he also believed in a sort of Lamarckian view of the inheritance of a ‘primal schema’ of desires and fantasies which determined the form taken by the Oedipal situation.,15
1600,"The French psychoanalyst, Jacques Lacan, argued that Freud himself (virtually all the psychoanalysts who revised Freud's theories) never managed to escape fully from the assumption of an already existing gendered subjectivity which entered into the Oedipal situation.",15
1601,"And Lacan argued that the human subject must be seen as constituted through language, through entry into the Symbolic Order.",15
1602,"Lacan, the aim  of psychoanalysis should be rigorously to deconstruct and expose the contradictions and radical fissues in which human subjectivity is born.",15
1603,"Feminism, as I have said, needs to preserve a critical distance from all theories of self.",15
1604,"But it needs also to engage with those theories which deconstruct the distinction between the ‘individual’ and the ‘social’, which recognise the power of desire and fantasy and the problems of supposing any ‘original’unity in the self, while at the same time preserving its concern with lived experience and the practical and material struggles of women to achieve more autonomy and control over their lives.",15
1605,"The appeal of what I have called the ‘humanist paradigm’ lies, I think, in the way it can seem to conceptualise the need women have experienced for this greater degree of autonomy and control, for overcoming the fragmentation and contradictions in their lives, and for a capacity for self-definition.",15
1606,No theory of self should lose sight of these things.,15
1607,"I have argued, however, that there are also aspects of women's experience which the humanist paradigm is unable to conceptualise adequately; hence the appeal of theories which attempt to ‘deconstruct’ the self in more radical ways.",15
1608,"But the danger in some ‘deconstructionist’ theories, however, is that they seem to leave no space for the material struggles or ordinary aspirations of women.",15
1609,"Thus it seems that Lacanian psychoanalysis, both in theory and practice, aims to show what a fragmented, decentred thing the human subject is, and Lacan has dismissed all talk of ‘unity’ or ‘identity’as an illusion.",15
1610,"It can be argued (though I do not have space to do it here), that there is an incoherence in a view of the subject which regards all notions of unity as an illusion.",15
1611,"But there is also a practical and political problem, since it is difficult to see how such a theory could speak in any way to the practical or material concerns of women.",15
1612,"The problem, then, is not to be seen as one of whether we should continue to use concepts like ‘identity’ or ‘autonomy’, or simply reject them hand.",15
1613,"It is a problem, rather, of how to offer an interpretation of them which neither assumes the original unitary self of the humanist paradigm, nor ignores the needs of women.",15
1614,And Freud can again provide a useful starting point.,15
1615,It is true that Freudian theory questions any notion of the original unity of the self.,15
1616,But it is not true that Freudian theory has no space for ideas of unity or autonomy.,15
1617,"The purpose of psychoanalytic therapy, Freud, was to remove the power of the symptom by  making it intelligible, by showing the that it had.",15
1618,Psychoanalysis aimed to trace its roots in unconscious desires (though this was not a process merely of intellectual understanding).,15
1619,"The unintelligible, alien quality of the symptom will be removed.",15
1620,"But for this to happen, a person's conception of themselves must also be transformed.",15
1621,"They must, , be able to think of themselves as ‘the sort of person who have incestuous sexual desires’, is prepared to avow them as ‘part’ of the self, and ceases to be so threatened by them.",15
1622,"Part of this process of change is a greater tolerance of certain aspects of oneself, and a lesser propensity for these to cause guilt or anxiety.",15
1623,"But, paradoxically perhaps, this greater tolerance may result in fragmentation, more coherence, and less subjection to the forms of anxiety or guilt or compulsive behaviour that may once have been so deeply disturbing or threatening.",15
1624,It seems to me that there is a sort of dialectic we need to preserve when thinking about autonomy.,15
1625,There is no authentic or unified ‘original’ self which can simply be recovered or discovered as the source of ‘autonomous’actions.,15
1626,"But we are often faced with the experienced need to make ‘sense’ of our lives and our feelings and goals, to relate confused fragments of ourselves into something that seems more coherent and of which we feel more in control.",15
1627,"We are often also faced, however, with the need to tolerate contradictions, not to strive for an illusory or impossible ideal, and to avoid self-punishing forms of anxiety, defence and guilt (and feminist guilt can be as punishing as any other kind).",15
1628,The dialectic of autonomy is one in which a constant (but never static or final) search for control and coherence needs balancing against a realism and tolerance born efforts to understand ourselves (and others) better.,15

1630,Luce Irigaray's Critique of Rationality,15
1631,Margaret Whitford,15
1632,"This paper is about a feminist philosopher, Luce Irigaray, whose work raises particular difficulties for the Anglo-Saxon reader unfamiliar with the Continental tradition of philosophy.",15
1633,"I In attempting to elucidate, its context, one of the strands of her critique of Western metaphysics, I hope to make her work more accessible for discussion to a wider readership.",15
1634,I must emphasise that this paper is only attempting to deal with one aspect of Irigaray's thought and will inevitably touch on issues that I won't have space to develop.,15
1635,The work of Irigaray raises questions about the edifice of Western rationality.,15
1636,"I would like here to approach these questions indirectly, to clarify their import a detour through the concept of the imaginary.",15
1637,"The term as a noun is current in French theoretical work, but not in English (except via Lacan, who gives the Imaginary, with a capital I, a major role in his theory).",15
1638,"Like its English cognate,, however, it is rich in connotations and operates differently in the different conceptual frameworks of the different authors who use it (authors as varied as Sartre, Bachelard, Barthes, Lacan, Castoriadis, Althusser).",15
1639,"My view is that Anglo-American feminists have tended to assimilate, and then dismiss Irigaray's work too quickly, because the concept of the imaginary has not been closely examined.",15
1640,"Either the imaginary has been ignored altogether, in which case Irigaray is mistakenly described as a biological essentialist (Sayers, 1982, p. 131; 1986, pp. 42–8), or else it has been interpreted as purely and simply a Lacanian concept, in which case the conclusion is that Irigaray has misunderstood or misread Lacan, and has not taken the implications of his theory (see Mitchell and Rose, 1982, pp. 54 6; Rose, 1985, pp. 136, 140; Ragland-Sullivan, 1986, pp. 273–80).",15
1,"Revival under Law, 1911–1914",16
2,Few contemporaries would have expected Balfour's retirement to lead to a Unionist recovery.,16
3,The party was in a mutinous condition in November 1911 and there was no apparent successor who would have even half of Balfour's political gifts.,16
4,"Nor was it clear that Balfour's departure was universally desired: at the National Union Conference a few days later, Leo Maxse was booed off the platform, and constituency parties everywhere passed resolutions regretting Balfour's decision.",16
5,"A great many crocodile tears were shed, for, since Unionists had such an elevated view of the principle of leadership, they were unable to accept that they had just driven their own leader from office.",16
6,The shock caused by Balfour's going thus did something to steady the party and it certainly produced a real determination to settle the affairs of the party with less friction than had been fashionable of late.,16
7,"The main contenders for the leadership were Austen Chamberlain and Walter Long, representing the two different establishments of the Edwardian Unionist party — the opposite worlds of Birmingham and Wiltshire — but the situation was complicated by the intervention of two outsiders, Edward Carson and Andrew Bonar Law.",16
8,"Two strong groups emerged behind Long and Chamberlain, about equal in numbers, but there were few backers for Carson or Law.",16
9,"Carson thereupon fell the contest — or rather announced that he was not standing, for no official nominations had been made.",16
10,"The party officers and Whips were solidly behind Chamberlain, but Law drew off some of his support among tariff reformers and, urged on by Edward Goulding and Max Aitken, he refused to withdraw unless his continued candidature would allow Long to win.",16
11,"Against Chamberlain it was remembered that he was a Liberal Unionist (as was Lansdowne, who led the Unionists in the Lords) and that he had not been entirely loyal to Balfour since the referendum pledge.",16
12,Long was supported by the bulk of the English county members but by few of the party's men of talent.,16
13,By the morning of Friday 10 November it was clear that neither Chamberlain nor Long would secure a majority and that some supporters of each of them would not contentedly follow the other.,16
14,A party meeting was to be held on the following Monday and the Whips were making preparation for a vote to be taken.,16
15,Chamberlain provided the way out by suggesting to Balcarres that both he and Long should withdraw and so allow Law to be elected unanimously; he also turned down  Balcarres's remarkable advice that he should allow Long to be elected since Long would make such a mess of things that Chamberlain would be bound to succeed within the year.,16
16,"Faced with Chamberlain's proposition, and without a majority of his own, Long had no option but to agree.",16
17,"Bonar Law, backed by fewer MPs than any of the other three contenders at the beginning of the week was now to be the unanimous choice.",16
18,"Robert Sanders reported the ""election"" meeting on 13 November with evident satisfaction:",16
19,The Carlton meeting on Monday went off quite admirably.,16
20,Harry Chaplin in the chair a very great success.,16
21,A good many men came into the room inclined to acquiesce in the proposed arrangement.,16
22,Walter Long proposed Bonar Law.,16
23,His speech was one of the best things I have heard.,16
24,Manly and rather touching.,16
25,The country gentleman at his best.,16
26,He spoke and evidently felt strongly of the degradation that it would have been to the parry to have elected a leader by secret ballot.,16
27,Austen followed.,16
28,When Austen sat down Chaplin suggested that he had better put the question and on getting an affirmative shout did so.,16
29,A clever way of stifling discussion and few could have done it so well.,16
30,Motion carried unanimously.,16
31,Bonar Law then sent for…,16
32,His speech struck me as the feeblest of the day.,16
33,He was evidently moved and nervous.,16
34,The meeting separated in great content with the Conservative Party all round.,16
35,It was certainly creditable.,16
36,The urgency of the events following Balfour's resignation was the need to find a new leader before the National Union Conference.,16
37,"So within a few days of his grudging acceptance by his parliamentary colleagues, Law's leadership was ratified by the throng of party notables at Leeds; here he received a reception more typical of what was to come in the future.",16
38,In 1911 Law was known — he was known in the parliamentary party — as a spirited debater.,16
39,A.).,16
40,"P. Taylor has noted that Law was trained, if he was trained for anything in his early career, to be a debater.",16
41,"In Glasgow he had picked up many of the skills that a more highly-born politician might have acquired in the Oxford Union or at the Bar, but skills that were very different in appearance.",16
42,His concern was solely with effectiveness style; he rarely spoke with more than brief notes and left it to the occasion to furnish the words.,16
43,"(When he became Chancellor of the Exchequer this practice caused consternation at the Treasury, when he used only a page of notes to assist him in moving complicated resolutions on wartime finance; he relied successfully on his memory to provide details and figures.)",16
44,As an extempore speaker he was able to tailor his words to his audience's reactions and so convey the impression of personal conversation addressing thousands.,16
45,"In parliament he was wont to abandon an argument half-completed if he sensed that his point had been made; the speeches that appear in Hansard were touched up by his staff, and his speeches in the country were given to the press in advance.",16
46,"In debate he was a formidable opponent, and one that Asquith was never able to master, for all his forensic skills.",16
47,Again Law succeeded by unorthodoxy; he was quick to grasp the essentials of an opponent's argument and quite prepared to be rude  or direct if the situation demanded it.,16
48,"In the long debates over Marconi in 1913 and over the Curragh ""mutiny"" in 1914 Law was able to nail Asquith's evasions where a more polished stylist might have been foiled.",16
49,"Occasionally, in the onrush of pursuit, he gave commitments that were later regretted, but these were a small price to pay.",16
50,"The Unionist recovery was built around Law's leadership, but what Asquith called the ""new style"" of obstruction, threats and offensive behaviour did not originate with Law.",16
51,The beginnings are to be found in the diehard campaign against the Parliament Bill.,16
52,"It was in June 1911 that the first scenes of disorder were mounted in the House of Commons, led by Lord Hugh Cecil.",16
53,"In August 1911 the diehard peers used language as violent as any that Law was to use later, and in the crucial decision on the House of Lords Law sided with the hedgers the ditchers.",16
54,Ulster's opposition to Home Rule long pre-dated Law's leadership and he had rarely even spoken on Irish affairs in parliament before becoming leader.,16
55,"Before he succeeded Balfour then, Law was not associated with any of the features that were to characterize his party leadership; his contribution was to use the leadership in the service of all of these causes, to make himself the spokesman for the most spirited sections of the party.",16
56,Law conceived of the role of the leader in an exactly opposite sense from Balfour: he sought to foster unity by placing himself at the head of the discordant elements where Balfour had thrown the leadership on the side of restraint.,16
57,"Their respective positions explain this : as ex-Prime Minister and a considerable figure in his own right, Balfour had the confidence to believe in his own judgement isolated from the bulk of the party; as the tertium quid in the recent contest, Law had neither the weight nor the confidence to take such a detached view.",16
58,"His strategy was rather to canalize the enthusiasm of the diehards into party channels, to articulate their views, and to create unity from the sense of movement.",16
59,"In his characteristic phrase, ""I am their leader, I must follow them"" — but he determined to follow them from the front.",16
60,"As a result of this he was labelled as a diehard and a bigot, when he actually distrusted the diehards and was himself distrusted by the bigots.",16
61,"Much of his leadership was thus a form of pragmatic extremism, extreme action and the threat of more extreme action to come, but used in the cause of more limited objectives.",16
62,"He certainly held deep convictions the absolute wrongness of the Liberal policies that he opposed, but a part of his apparent hostility was assumed for the occasion, a hard line that might secure a better compromise in the end.",16
63,So in his first major speech as leader in parliament he wasted little time on the customary compliments and warned the government that he intended to play hard.,16
64,"In private conversation he told Asquith""I am afraid that I shall have to show myself very vicious Mr Asquith this session.",16
65,"I hope you will understand.""",16
66,"In later conversations about Ulster, Law was frank enough to point out that bloodshed in Ulster would be the best way of ensuring an electoral landslide for the Unionists.",16
67,"There was then an  open toughness about party tactics; before the Buckingham Palace Conference in 1914 he had Central Office work out the electoral effects of excluding nine, six or four counties of Ulster from an independent Ireland the concern of a calculating pragmatist not of a bigot.",16
68,"From the party viewpoint Law's methods were successful but dangerous; expectations raised when the party was in full cry were not easily set aside for an eventual compromise, and the only outcome that would fully vindicate the methods was the recovery of power.",16
69,The basis of recovery was then Law's fighting capacities as leader.,16
70,In parliament there would be a carefully organized campaign of resistance that would slow the government down and raise Unionist morale.,16
71,"Improved morale would also make possible organizational advances outside parliament, all linked to the issue of Ulster, and with the sights fixed firmly on the next election, an election that would make or break the Union, the Empire and Law's leadership of the party.",16
72,"All was linked to the sense of a new departure, a ""new style"" , a ""new regime in politics"" and a new team at the helm: a new leader, the party had by the middle of 1912 a new Chief Whip, Party Chairman, party treasurer, principal agent, press adviser, and an almost entirely new team of Whips and organizers.",16
73,Party organization provided the easiest advances because it was the only area entirely under the party's control.,16
74,"No general election was fought by the organization set up after 1911, but there is little doubt that there was a massive improvement; criticisms that were commonplace in 1910 were not to be heard by 1913.",16
75,"The space available to Central Office was increased by the acquisition of St Stephen's House St Stephen's Chambers, which had been occupied since 1874; the new office cost $3,000 a year in rent alone.",16
76,The quality of the senior staff was improved by the appointment of three specialists.,16
77,"John Boraston took over as Principal Agent in 1912, having been a professional organizer all his career and latterly chief agent to the Liberal Unionist Council.",16
78,"He joined William Jenkins, appointed chief organizing agent in 1911 and previously district agent for the Midlands Liberal Unionists.",16
79,The party was indeed handed over to Birmingham.,16
80,"Finally, Malcolm Fraser, ex-editor of the Standard and of the Daily Express became first honorary press adviser and subsequently was employed to run the press bureau at the colossal salary of £1,200.",16
81,"Steel-Maitland, Boraston, Jenkins and Fraser made up a team of experts, all of sufficient status to deal with politicians who might call into the office; the work of the office was departmentalized for the first time and the heads of department brought together into a supervising board.",16
82,The influence of Central Office toned up the rest of the organization.,16
83,A new canvass system was introduced in 1911 all county constituencies would operate the same system and so that duplicate records could be kept at area level.,16
84,This was important at a time when outvoters were a larger group in many constituencies than the size of the majority and when the outvoters were overwhelmingly Unionist.,16
85,"In 1914 a register of car owners was  compiled, also important when some voters could cast several votes in an election when polling went several days.",16
86,"By November 1912 only fifty-one constituencies in Great Britain were without candidates, a much better position than the position at dissolution in either 1909 or 1910; few of these fifty-one constituencies were winnable, but in any case most of them had candidates by the end of 1913.",16
87,"A programme of speakers for a general election was also ready by 1913, with both constituencies and politicians told in advance what they might expect.",16
88,The financial mismanagement that had reigned before 1911 was ended with the employment of professional accountants.,16
89,"Expenditure on Central Office, district offices and the London office doubled from £32,466 in 1909–10 to $68,957 in 1913–14; the total expenditure of the party organization from central funds also doubled from $73,000 to over £150,000.",16
90,"To pay for this outpouring, a great drive was mounted for additional income -by Farquhar and Steel-Maitland.",16
91,In 1912 ordinary subscriptions still brought in only £12000 a year and it proved difficult to raise them to anything like what was needed.,16
92,"The method adopted was to canvass for capital donations that could then be invested to bring in a regular income, and both Balfour and Law were used to raise the wind.",16
93,"Steel-Maitland told Balfour that""Farquhar and I are endeavouring to raise more money.",16
94,I think we are likely to succeed — thanks to the very generous example set by Lord Rothschild.,16
95,"But I would b, e very glad if I might see you on your return to ask you to help me in two cases.",16
96,"Systematic collections were made from peers and from the City; by the outbreak of war the invested funds amounted to $671,000 — twice the sum in 1911 and worth four years""expenditure — and there was a special cash deposit of £120,000 for the coming election.",16
97,"In three other areas, as much political as organizational, advances were made towards the management of the press, the coordination of the heterogeneous collection that made up the party, and the fostering of modern attitudes in the local parties.",16
98,Under Malcolm Fraser the party began to make effective use of its support in Fleet Street.,16
99,"It had been recognized that Liberals had been more adept at handling the press because they were more ready to stoop to newspaper practices, as Sandars had reported in 1909:",16
100,"I told Northcliffe that if his people would make enquiries at our Central Office, he would find that our nightly regiment of speakers was as well worth reporting as the Radical contingent, but that I realized that from the Press point of view, , our speakers did not play the reporters by handing them their speeches in advance, and by other tricks of the kind to which the Radical orators have recourse.",16
101,This was the essence of the problem: the press could only be managed by someone who knew their methods and who would not expect them to come round to Central Office to search for news.,16
102,"The UOC found that""it is patent that some feeling exists among the Unionist Press that, while in the past they have done much for the Party, the Party has not assisted in their work.",16
103,"In  many quarters it is asserted that the Unionist Press are treated with greater courtesy by the Radicals than by their own side.""",16
104,"Fraser dealt with this problem without difficulty and explained to Law in 1913 that""the importance of getting important speeches in advance is shown in concrete manner by your Wallsend speech on October 29th.",16
105,"The verbatim reports reached most of the newspapers in places Aberdeen at one o ""clock in the morning of the 30th."" ",16
106,He went on to quote the response that had been received from editors:,16
107,Manchester Dispatch: I hope you will continue this form of enterprise.,16
108,You fully know as an old pressman the difficulty of dealing with a big speech late at night…,16
109,Daily Express: I am much obliged to you for the precis of Mr Bonar Law's speech last night.,16
110,It was a great help to us.,16
111,The speech came over the wires so late and the sheets were so confused by the Post Office — which is usual in these cases — that without the precis we could not possibly have got the leader through in time for the first edition.,16
112,"So in the supply of information to newspapers predisposed to support the party, much was achieved merely by employing a specialist.",16
113,"The other side of press management, informal contacts, is less easy to assess.",16
114,In 1911 Steel-Maitland invited Blumenfeld of the Daily Express to Central Office for a two-way exchange of ideas and advice.,16
115,"He also used Law himself to impress editors who were on less familiar terms with Fraser, as with Marlowe of the Daily Mail, and Law took a direct interest in negotiations with the most difficult of all the Unionist editors, J. L. Garvin of the Observer.",16
116,"Law personally conducted the negotiations with Gardner Sinclair over the sale of the Observer and the Pall Mall Gazette in 1914; this negotiation also demonstrates that, producing information and nursing editors, the party had to work hard to keep some of the newspapers in business.",16
117,"Sinclair did buy the Observer and the Pall Mall in the end, but not before he had been given a $45,000 guarantee from party funds.",16
118,"Such investments had a double purpose, for they could bring in income and provide a political bonus.",16
119,"One such scheme involved the purchase of the Daily Express by Max Aitken with party funds, but the party was also propping up the Globe, the Standard, and a wide range of provincial dailies.",16
120,"All these transactions were secret, for there would be little use in keeping a paper alive if it were known to be owned by a political party.",16
121,The papers were therefore bought through nominees or bank loans backed with party capital.,16
122,It was usual to extract some form of guarantee in exchange for party support but the secrecy prevented such undertakings from being enforced.,16
123,"Sinclair thus gave an undertaking that his papers would always remain Unionist, but Steel-Maitland doubted if such a promise had any value.",16
124,"The later history of the Daily Express suggests not: when the Express became hostile in the 1920s, Younger raged ""when I think of the large sum of money this office has put into that gutter print it makes my blood boil"" .",16
125,The justification for pouring out large sums without a certain return was the even greater cost  of any real alternative.,16
126,"The support for the Express in 1912""provides for the introduction of £50,000 or $60,000 to retain the only half-penny paper the Party possesses in London, and no less a sum than $700,000 to £1, 000,000 would be necessary to start a similar paper if the Daily Express were allowed to go.",16
127,"The struggle therefore went on to keep the Unionist press alive, and in 1912 and 1913 both Aitken and Northcliffe stood by the party and gave valuable support in their papers.",16
128,The coordination of competing party bodies was carried out with surprising ease.,16
129,The National Union was merged with Central Office in 1911 and fusion with the Liberal Unionists followed in 1912.,16
130,Joseph Chamberlain retained his preference for independence but allowed himself to be overruled by Austen and by the overwhelming wishes of the Liberal Unionist Council to merge.,16
131,"To cater for all susceptibilities, the party became the ""National Unionist Association of Conservative and Unionist Associations"" — a decision that allowed some local parties to go on calling themselves Conservative, but the name ""Liberal"" was dropped.",16
132,The Liberal Unionists were admitted to the Carlton Club and a longstanding source of tension was eradicated.,16
133,This was in itself a striking commentary on what had already been done: Liberal Unionists who had resisted amalgamation under Balfour and Acland-Hood in 1911 acquiesced meekly under Law and Steel-Maitland in 1912.,16
134,Other organizations could not be absorbed but could still be brought within the Central Office orbit.,16
135,So in 1911 Steel-Maitland offered to join the Halsbury Club to guide it on to safer lines — and was immediately accused of disloyalty by Walter Long.,16
136,Long helped though by placing both Steel-Maitland and Boraston on the Executive Committee of the Union Defence League for the same purpose.,16
137,"Steel-Maitland also explained to Lord Robert Cecil that ""it has been arranged that the National Conservative Union should send out leaflets produced by several of the ancillary organizations, the Tariff Reform League, the Anti-Socialist Union, the Primrose League, the London Municipal Society etc."" ",16
138,"The Central Office attitude was flexible, for outside bodies would always exist and could even be made use of:",16
139,"They represent a time when either their objects were not the same as those of the official organization, or the CCO was not enterprising enough to suit them.",16
140,But some caution should be observed.,16
141,"It may be wise, while retaining or regaining control, to trade under different names.",16
142,"In some cases additional subscriptions may be obtained, in others full responsibility may be avoided.",16
143,"With open allies like the Primrose League, the case for collaboration was strong; for the first time in thirty years of existence the Primrose League formally linked itself with the party in 1914.",16
144,"On the other hand, the independence of the Tariff Reform League was a positive advantage: after January 1913 the party supported the tariff policy but was not including them in its immediate programme, Central Office could continue to distribute tariff propaganda from the TRL without compromising party policy.",16
145,", efforts to ensure better coordination were a matter of the  patient building up of contacts, although the improved party morale and the greater efficiency of Central Office had removed their justification for existence.",16
146,"It was the First World War that finally killed off the ""legion of Leagues"" , but it had ceased to be a problem before 1914.",16
147,Modernization at the local level was also a matter of patience:,16
148,"The difficulty of all this work is trebled through the face that the Office cannot say ""go and he goes, and come and he comes"" as in a factory.",16
149,"It is always ""by your leave and if you please"" , and the influence in controlling, which might be very great…is only exerted through position, knowledge and willingness to help.""",16
150,"Steel-Maitland's method was the systematic collection of information by the Central Office district agents in constituency books that recorded all income, expenditure and political activity.",16
151,"The National Union and the Whips were used when necessary to exert pressure for reform, but the main influence was the Central Office agents:",16
152,I propose to make proper local centres of the Central Office Agents.,16
153,"If they are to get full influence for the purpose of bringing constituencies the mark, they can only get it by being the channels for help.",16
154,I propose therefore that speakers in a locality should be supplied by the Agent it; and that grants of literature and money to organizations be made through them.,16
155,"By 1913–14, over £25,000 was being given away in this manner and in return the Central Office agents were able to ensure the appointment of suitable constituency agents and the choice of good candidate The outlay constituted only about a tenth of the whole of the local parties""expenditure, but a much higher proportion of the expenditure of the backward parties most reform.",16
156,"The First World""War interrupted the process, but it is clear that much had been done by 1914.",16
157,In the political world there were issues that Unionists could always exploit against a Liberal government defence policy and the administration of the Empire.,16
158,"The threatening international situation gave new impetus to demands for a larger navy and a conscript army, both taken up by Unionists.",16
159,"The National Service League ran the campaign for conscription and the Navy League the campaign for faster naval building, but both were led by known Unionists.",16
160,"In 1912 the Conference gave its support and condemned""the criminal failure of H.M.",16
161,"Ministers to maintain the British Navy and the British Army at a standard of strength adequate to National and Imperial needs"".",16
162,"In the following year an even stronger resolution on the navy was passed unanimously, but a resolution calling for national service was conveniently not reached at the end of the order paper; there was an undoubted commitment to a stronger army and navy but some doubt about the  of a party commitment to conscription In peacetime.",16
163,"In any case, all this helped to prepare for the militarist attitude that the party was to take when war came, when it could advocate conscription without any fear of the electoral consequences.",16
164,Individual Unionists pursued the defence issues even  more strongly than the leaders.,16
165,"Lord Charles Beresford continued his campaign against the Admiralty that had originated in his personal feud with Admiral Fisher, and he made the most of Churchill's unhappy relations with his admirals.",16
166,"The Morning Post joined in when the First Sea Lord, Sir Francis Bridgeman, resigned in 1912 and Bonar Law took up the issue too, suggesting that Bridgeman had been ""brutally ill-used"" by Churchill.",16
167,"The Secretary of State for War, John Seely, was also a favourite target, for he too was a renegade Unionist.",16
168,In 1913 he came under pressure in the Commons for his failure to promote an air force; Samuel Hoare demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the government's policy by visiting the air bases to see them for himself.,16
169,"Unionists had easy openings on defence issues, for many Unionist MPs were ex-officers, but the experience of the country in the first two years of War suggests that their criticisms were not exaggerated.",16
170,Defence was linked in the Unionist mind with imperial consolidation through tariffs: the new policy of 1901–2 had followed directly from the military weakness revealed by the Boer War and the approach of probable European conflict reinforced the same cause.,16
171,The tariff reform camp had a bonus in 1911 from events in Canada: Laurier's Liberal government had negotiated a Reciprocity Agreement with the United States that cut across all of the arguments for imperial preference.,16
172,"Liberals saw this as evidence that the dominions were more interested in going their own way, but Unionists retorted that Canada like Britain had been led astray by a radical government and that Canada's decision was the result of Britain's failure to offer preference.",16
173,"Unionists were therefore beside themselves with joy when the Canadian electorate removed Laurier from office in September 1911 and replaced him with a Conservative, Sir Robert Borden, who now repudiated reciprocity.",16
174,Unionist associations passed resolutions of support and the Unionist press hailed Borden as the hero who had saved the empire.,16
175,"This boost did much to wipe out the effect of Balfour's referendum pledge, which had been made a month before the Reciprocity Agreement and was erroneously believed to be its cause.",16
176,"It was now of the utmost importance for the Unionists to clarify their own position; Balfour's pledge had been a conditional one and was not in any case binding on his successor, but the unpopularity of food taxes remained.",16
177,The shadow cabinet decided in April 1912 that it would abandon the referendum idea and return to the full tariff policy.,16
178,"The decision was not an easy one and was criticized by many who feared the consequences, as Salisbury told Law: ""If it may be said to have finally made possible the destruction of the constitution, the prostitution of the Prerogative, the Repeal of the Union and the Disendowment of the Welsh Church, it will probably rank as the most costly policy in history."" ",16
179,"Salisbury was supported in his attitude by his brothers, by Curzon and by Selborne; he would certainly be supported by Derby and by the weight of opinion on Lancashire.",16
180,"The shadow cabinet therefore took its decision in the clear knowledge that it would have a fight on  its hands, but it did so with the support of Lansdowne and Law.",16
181,"Replying to Salisbury, Law urged the positive side of the tariff policy for the economy and the danger of a party split if the referendum were not repudiated; there was a minority of free-traders, but there was also a vociferous majority of tariff reformers.",16
182,The real reason though went deeper than tactical manoeuvring:,16
183,"I really believe, and it is here I think that I differ from your that there is in Tariff Reform; and I believe also that there is even in the food part of it.",16
184,I do not now allude to preference though that comes first.,16
185,"In fact my real belief is that in the troubles us connected with labour we are moving very fast in the direction of revolution; and though you will consider my hope a baseless one I still entertain it — that it is by Tariff Reform that we might, so to speak, get the train shifted other lines.",16
186,"These two motivations are worth considering on their merits, for they reveal Bonar Law as a thinker of some insight.",16
187,The imperial preference aspect was important because it might arrest the trends pulling the Empire apart; reciprocity had shown the danger and there was little time left to halt the slide.,16
188,In retrospect it may seem that the trend was already irresistible — the First World War certainly made it so — but who is to say that a positive imperial policy pursued energetically in 1902 or 1912 was inevitably doomed to failure?,16
189,"This was the pure gospel of Joseph Chamberlain, especially real to Law his Canadian connections, but the real significance of the decision was felt by few in Britain, even on the Unionist side.",16
190,"We can now see how important a policy it might have been, how great a shift in the tides of history that it was attempting.",16
191,"In the domestic sphere the policy was equally fundamental, for tariff reform was seen as the antithesis of socialism.",16
192,"The Bismarckian social policy implied by tariffs, the success of the policy in places like Birmingham where it was properly advocated, and its attraction to social engineers like the early Fabians, all lend a certain plausibility to the idea.",16
193,"If something drastic were not done, then British politics would drift into class antagonism could be observed in France.",16
194,The elections of 1906 and 1910 had shown the danger to the Unionist party from a Liberal-Labour alliance on class lines; the budget of 1909 had shown how far that alliance might threaten the social base on which Unionism itself rested; and the encroachments of the syndicalists suggested that there might be dangerous forces yet to be released.,16
195,"The only hope for a pessimist like Law was to ""get the train other lines"" — to focus the attention on the national unity of Britain on internal divisions; in other words to emulate Germany France.",16
196,"Again this hope seems set against the tides of history, but again we cannot be certain that a positive policy of Empire and tariffs could not have turned back the tide in 1902 or 1912.",16
197,"The infant Labour Party was just building its strength, but it was not yet capable of winning seats on its own, and it might have been checkmated for a generation by a positive social policy financed from tariffs.",16
198,"The tariff policy therefore  carried with it the last hope of consolidating the Empire and the last hope of reversing the drift into class politics; as a pessimist, Law saw further ahead than most of his contemporaries, and events proved him to be more nearly right than they were.",16
199,"In deference to the opposition within the party, the abandonment of the referendum was kept secret until Law had been able to consult with Borden, who insisted that tariffs without food taxes would be no value to Canada, but who also refused to make a public intervention in British politics.",16
200,"Fortified by assurances that confirmed his own views, Law pressed ahead, and the Tariff Reform League was mobilized for another great campaign.",16
201,"Lansdowne announced the changed policy at an Albert Hall rally on 14 November 1912, and Law gave his support at Ashton-under-Lyne on 16 December.",16
202,"The only modification offered by Law the outcry from Unionist free-traders was that food taxes would be imposed only if requested by the Dominions; after his talks with Borden, there was no doubt about this anyway.",16
203,"By Christmas the party was in a furore, with the Cecils and Stanleys agitating against the new policy.",16
204,Derby found a means of holding his leader to  : a meeting of Lancashire Unionists which threatened to disown the new policy was adjourned for three weeks at his suggestion.,16
205,"He protested to Law that he was doing everything possible to hold Lancashire steady, but he was actually doing all he could to keep the issue alive, including the sending of a questionnaire to all the Lancashire constituencies.",16
206,"Law was thus besieged with demands that he should retreat to a compromise position as Balfour had done in 1910, and again these demands came from tariff reformers free-traders.",16
207,"The leaders would now have to resign, to change their policy, or to see their policy rejected by Lancashire Unionists early in the new year.",16
208,"Both Lansdowne and Law opted to announce their resignation at a party meeting, which would revive the open warfare over tariffs that had existed before 1906, and this would ensure the defeat of all the other party causes too.",16
209,"Long was now unwell and Austen Chamberlain could hardly become leader if Law had resigned over food taxes, there was no credible successor to Law.",16
210,"Law had indeed already done enough as leader to make his departure unthinkable and so a memorial was drawn up by Carson and signed by almost all the party's backbenchers, stating full confidence in Law and begging him to stay on with a revised tariff policy.",16
211,"Lansdowne and Law could only accede with as good a grace as they could muster; the party was therefore committed to a full policy of imperial preference, but food taxes would be excluded unless approved by a second general election.",16
212,Law was bound to give way but in doing so he sacrificed the only positive policy he had.,16
213,"Without food taxes, he would have nothing to offer the Dominions to induce concessions in return and it would be impossible to advocate the policy with the fervour that would alone enable it to challenge the distribution of wealth as the central political issue of the future.",16
214,"In the urge to protect itself for the  negative battles of the present, the party thus pulled back from its only truly positive policy for the future.",16
215,"This dispute was the only major internal wrangle between Law's election and the war, but it illustrated the fragility of his achievement as a flash of lightning illuminates a landscape.",16
216,Relations with Austen Chamberlain were never quite the same and although only a handful of MPs refused to sign the memorial they included personal friends of Law like Amery and Aitken.,16
217,"The unity of the party survived and was even strengthened by the clearing of the air, but the crisis left a bitter taste.",16
218,"Behind the scenes efforts were being made to broaden the party's appeal by strengthening its policies for social reform, the essential counterpoint to the theme of tariffs.",16
219,This had been the intention of The New Order in 1908 and many of its contributors were enthusiastic backers of the Unionist Social Reform Committee when it was set up in 1911.,16
220,"This was always an unofficial research body, but it employed full-time staff, was housed at Central Office, and used the full machinery of party publicity to make itself known.",16
221,This may have been the support of Steel-Maitland who was a founder member before he became Party Chairman and who later served on its committee on mental health.,16
222,"The purpose of the USRC was explained by its secretary to Lord Willoughby de Broke in August 1911: ""I still remain convinced as I have always been that unless you put yourself straight with the people on Social questions all your Tariff Reform, Home Rule or Constitutional thunderbolts will be discharged -in vain.",16
223,"You have to establish your before you can be listened to.""",16
224,"F. E. Smith was chairman of the new organization and announced its formation in a party magazine in the previous month; the range of subjects being investigated then included such diverse topics as police, aliens, asylums and railway clerks""compensation.",16
225,"The committee ""had secured the services of some of the best experts available"" and had sent observers to examine social legislation abroad.",16
226," ""By this means we hope to place at the disposal of our party in Parliament and in the country a trained body of fully formed critics, able not only to expose and correct the usual crudities of Radical-Socialist legislation, but to give form to a comprehensive policy of social reform."" ",16
227,"The USRC was therefore set up to play a role like that of the Conservative Research Department after 1929, but more unofficially.",16
228,"The committee's main concerns reflected the interests of its keenest members: the law of aliens covered by Edward Goulding, the poor law covered by Jack Hills, and rural housing covered by Arthur Griffith Boscawen.",16
229,"By 1914, Maurice Woods was able to announce that the committee had completed its immediate programme in every field but one and had therefore embarked on several secondary projects.",16
230,"The most successful project was on housing, which was exploited by the USRC in parliament and by Central Office in its propaganda.",16
231,"Griffith-Boscawen introduced in 1912 a Bill to make improvement grants for rural housing, a proposal that provided a Unionist response to Lloyd George's Land  Campaign.",16
232,"Unionist MPs made much capital from the embarrassment of Liberals who had to vote the Bill down and from the ineffectiveness of John Burns, one of the weakest of the Liberal ministers.",16
233,"Our Flag covered the debates in detail and three leaflets were published, the last with the pithy legend""The Housing Problem — Radicals block Unionist Action.",16
234,The aim of the USRC was to create just such an impression as Disraeli had done — that Unionist action would be worth more than Liberal words — and they often quoted him with pride.,16
235,"The greatest difficulty for the USRC was within the party, for any commitment to a positive social policy would be resisted by those whose vested interests were threatened, as Robert Sanders noted over labourers""wages:",16
236,"George Kidner came to me in a great state of mind because he has been asked to appear before a committee consisting of C. Bathurst, Peto & C. Mills & sitting at Central Office.",16
237,"This committee suggested to him a policy that included a tribunal to fix the labourers""wages.",16
238,Kidner much perturbed at such a suggestion.,16
239,St. Audries actually wrote Bonar Law on the subject & got a reply saying the policy was quite unauthorised.,16
240,The USRC therefore made only a limited impact; most of its members sat for industrial seats and its propaganda was concentrated there for their benefit.,16
241,"Bonar Law was prepared to make the right noises — in 1913 at Manchester he called for a positive social policy in Disraelian lines for ""the swing of the pendulum is not enough"" , but he would give no more active support.",16
242,The value of the USRC was thus of an indirect kind; by involving seventy MPs and peers in social research the Unionist belief that the party was a party of reform was re-established; it began the trend towards research for political action that was to accelerate after the war; and it affected much later policy by influencing those who were to make it.,16
243,"Baldwin, Steel-Maitland, Hills, Griffith-Boscawen, Ashley, Ormsby-Gore and Baird were all members of the USRC, and all ministers after 1922.",16
244,"When in 1918 the party needed a social programme for negotiations with Lloyd George, it was to the work of the USRC that they turned; in 1922 Griffith-Boscawen was able as Minister of Health to do some of the things he had attempted in 1912; much of Neville Chamberlain's work as a reformer of the Poor Law was presaged by a USRC report of 1913 written by Hills.",16
245,(Neville Chamberlain was not himself a member of the USRC because he was not an MP but worked with it.),16
246,The value of the USRC lies in its long-term contribution to Conservative policy and in its re-creation of the tradition of Conservative reform that perished with Randolph Churchill.,16
247,"Paul Smith has argued that Disraeli was no great reformer but was of enormous value to the party because he was believed to have been one; in rediscovering Disraeli, the USRC rediscovered the myth too.",16
248,Little of this positive side of Unionism was visible in 1912 and 1913 for it was submerged in the negative task of weakening the Liberal government and  resisting Home Rule.,16
249,"More typically, the Unionist belief in the Empire was set against the Liberal plans to break up the United Kingdom, as in the leaflet Under which flag? of July 1914: this made the comparison between Unionists who had fought in South Africa and Liberals who had been pro-Boer and who would now shoot loyal Ulstermen.",16
250,This stark contrast provided the basis for Unionism's last great campaign.,16
251,"The parliamentary battle had an air of shadow-boxing about it, for the ultimate outcome was certain from the start and the timetable could be predicted almost as easily.",16
252,"Under the Parliament Act the Lords could bold up legislation for two years, so Home Rule and Welsh Disestablishment would both become law in 1914, a year before an election need be held.",16
253,"There was no doubt that the Liberals would press on with this timetable, and little doubt that the Labour and Irish MPs would support them; Unionists could not therefore stop Home Rule becoming law.",16
254,"Their tirades in parliament were designed for consumption outside, to be read in the constituencies, in Ulster, and at the Palace.",16
255,"The anger of the Unionists was based partly on the old political frustration of government by log-rolling, and partly on a new constitutional point.",16
256,"In 1910 few Liberals had argued for Home Rule in their election addresses or speeches, so they could not be said to have a clear mandate for it.",16
257,"Nor had the Liberals said clearly what sort of reform they would impose on the House of Lords, and the reform that was passed in 1911 left a serious constitutional problem.",16
258,"Asquith's reform had been presented as an interim measure and the preamble to his Bill stated that the Lords""powers were being curtailed pending the introduction of a reform of their composition.",16
259,"The government made no effort to redeem this promise but Unionists believed that they were in a temporary phase pending the reconstruction of the upper house, and that it was therefore no business of the government to bring in other constitutional Bills before they had settled the constitution itself.",16
260,"the constitution was as Bonar Law argued ""in suspense"" , and so unconstitutional opposition would be justified.",16
261,The Unionists also had two other arguments in their case.,16
262,"In the first place it could be argued that a democratic government would not impose unreasonably on minorities; this exposed the party to Liberal charges that they were indifferent to the Irish Nationalists, but it also exposed the weakness of the government's position, as Law explained to the Commons in January 1913:",16
263,"If you say that the Nationalists of Ireland have a right to claim to go the united Kingdom as a community if you say that five or six of the whole of the United Kingdom have that right because they wish to have separate rule for themselves, how can you say that a body in Ireland, not five or six , but twenty-five of the whole population, has not an equal right to separate treatment?",16
264,"That argument has been put by many of us, and by myself many times, and it has never been answered.",16
265,The second argument had a more practical flavour and consisted simply of a  demand that the issue should be put to the test of an election.,16
266,"Since there had been no clear mandate in 1910 and since the Lords could not now force another election, Unionists would have to resist until the government called one themselves.",16
267,"Asquith replied that the question of mandates was not so simple, but he was opposed to an election for the same reason as Unionists wanted one:— both knew that Home Rule was not a winning policy outside Ireland.",16
268,Law taunted Asquith with this in March 1914:,16
269,"I said to the Prime Minister: Make certain — and surely, all this trouble it is worthwhile making certain — that you have the will of the country behind you, and, so far as the Unionist party are concerned, we will absolutely cease all unconstitutional opposition to the carrying of your measure.",16
270,"Note Law's own use of the word ""unconstitutional"" to describe his actions and the extent to which all was pinned on an election.",16
271,"At bottom then there was some democratic basis for the Unionist case, for the government was pressing on with a reform that they knew was not backed by the electorate.",16
272,"It may be alleged that such Unionist arguments were specious, that their concern was solely to exploit a winning issue at any cost to the nation, but this would be to misunderstand the Unionists themselves.",16
273,Many believed that the Liberal Labour alliance was a threat to a system of government built up over centuries and they were not prepared to see this done without a clear decision by the electorate.,16
274,"And it is vital to see that there was a real Unionist case against the government, for this alone explains the popular support that was mobilized and the impression that was made on the army and the King — the only forces left to stop the government.",16
275,There is no doubt that Unionists believed in what they were doing or that they saw the government's actions as justifying their responses.,16
276,"In 1912 Walter Long accepted the phrase ""the new style"" and flung it back at the government: ""The New Style consists in the cynical violation of the honourable traditions of public life.",16
277,"Government in the New Style consists in gambling with the interests of the nation to propitiate the various mutinous factions which hold the balance in the House of Commons.""",16
278,Law also charged the government with being under the control of Redmond:,16
279,I am not going to say anything about the subserviency of the Government.,16
280,There is no need to tell the country about that.,16
281,Everybody has seen it.,16
282,"It is impossible to look at any of their actions during the past three years without seeing that they are carrying Home Rule at the dictation of the Nationalist party, but that that Home Rule may be carried they are turning up everything in the country.",16
283,"These statements spoke for the whole Unionist party in their vigorous tone, in the denial that Unionists were responsible for the state of things, and in the laying of blame on the Nationalists.",16
284,In Parliament there was non-cooperation that became almost a guerrilla war between the parties.,16
285,"Exchanges between Bonar Law and the government became ever more abrupt, as the following example from March 1914 shows:",16
286,Mr Churchill: It is admitted that a misunderstanding on the point arose.,16
287,Mr Bonar Law: Rubbish!,16
288,"Mr Churchill: Do I understand the Right Honourable Gentleman to say ""Rubbish"" ?",16
289,Mr Bonar Law: Yes.,16
290,"Meanwhile, the Whips pursued the government in the hope of catching them out in a snap vote; at the least this would disrupt their progress and there seemed an outside chance that the government would tire of the interminable pressure and throw in the sponge.",16
291,"It might not succeed in stopping Home Rule, but it could certainly take up enough time to stop a Plural Voting Bill from getting through.",16
292,"The government's full majority of over a hundred was difficult to muster the absence of Irish MPs, and the effective majority was gradually reduced by constant harassment.",16
293,"In February 1912 the majority was down to fifty or sixty; in June the Unionists made their first real attempt to ""snap"" the government and got the majority down to twenty-two.",16
294,At the same time Unionist speakers  all other Bills and pairing was stopped.,16
295,"In July the government majority fell to three on one vote but this narrow margin produced better attendances on the government side; Unionists therefore sent their MPs off to speak around the country ""with an occasional rush to London to keep the Rads. there"" .",16
296,These wearing tactics led to the government's defeat in November 1912.,16
297,"All was carefully organized, not only for the debate and the vote, but also for the disorder that would follow when Asquith moved to rescind the vote: Ministers were shouted down, a copy of Standing Orders was thrown at Churchill, and the Speaker had to suspend the House until the following week the danger of actual fighting in the House.",16
298,"After the weekend, the Unionist Whips decided that they had taken things far enough, having wasted an entire week of parliamentary time and given their supporters a sign of the vigour with which the fight was being waged.",16
299,"For the rest of the session and in the spring of 1913, the Liberals took no risk of further defeat, but this required constant attendance at the House by Liberal MPs; the result was that there was no autumn session in 1913 and no Plural Voting Bill was passed.",16
300,It would now be too late to force the abolition of plural voting on the House of Lords before the next general election; something had been achieved.,16
301,In 1913 the Unionists found a new line of attack through the Marconi Scandal.,16
302,This has to be seen against the Unionist belief that Asquith's government was corrupt irresponsible and radical.,16
303,"At the Albert Hall in January 1912 Law had made this point with characteristic bluntness: Liberals were expert only ""in electioneering, in the small trickery of politics"" .",16
304,"They had given rewards and favours to their supporters, especially in Wales, and""have succeeded in six years in creating a political spoils system which already rivals that of the United States.",16
305,"If we have a few more years of Georgian finance, the only attractive, the only lucrative profession left in this country will be that of a Radical Welsh politician.""",16
306,"Steel-Maitland wrote to The Times in 1913 to accuse the Liberals of corrupt practices at the Wick  Burghs by-election, and Sanders noted that at Taunton they had given away half-crowns wrapped in Liberal leaflets; both contests went against the trend, so there may be some truth in the allegations.",16
307,"In April 1914, George Younger wrote in Our Flag about ""Radical"" Buy ""Election promises"" and cited ten cases from the past six years when Liberal by-election candidates had made promises to local groups of voters the government promises of a change in policy to benefit local crafts or industry or employment.",16
308,Such actions did not infringe the Corrupt Practice Acts but they did make them virtually inoperative.,16
309,"Unionist publications also devoted much attention to Asquith's Honours Lists, and in October 1912 Our Flag listed thirty-nine ""Radical Plutocrats"" , of which twenty-three had been ennobled by the Liberals — ""so far"" .",16
310,The allegation that the Liberals were selling honours political contributions was brutally clear.,16
311,It was in this general context that the Unionist attitude to Marconi was set.,16
312,"In October 1912 both Rufus Isaacs and Lloyd George denied that they had engaged in dealings in Marconi shares, but a Select Committee was set up to investigate the allegations of sensationalist newspapers.",16
313,"Only when it became clear, through a libel action against Le Matin early in 1913, that the government had misled the Commons did the Unionists move into action.",16
314,The Liberals secured the majority report of the Select Committee but the Unionist members under Lord Robert Cecil extracted ever more damaging evidence from the witnesses interviewed.,16
315,"Debates followed in parliament with the Unionists in full cry, for the Liberals seemed to have been caught out in a case of open corruption.",16
316,"In the end the government's majority triumphed and the whole affair died away, but Marconi remained a favourite cry of Unionist hecklers in 1914.",16
317,"It must be noted first that the Liberals really did have something to hide over Marconi, but it must be.",16
318,noted also that Unionists were not being very honest in their more general allegations.,16
319,"The misleading of the Commons by ministers, the deliberate absence from Britain of the Master of Elibank (he could not be questioned), and the evasions of the Prime Minister all created the suspicion that something was wrong and Unionists were perfectly justified in their attempts to find out what it was.",16
320,"On the more general point, charges of corruption were disingenuous.",16
321,The practice of selling honours had been increasing under all governments and it was becoming more marked in both parties.,16
322,"Lord Hugh Cecil doubted if his father had dealt in such things but suspected""that both Asquith and A.).",16
323,"B. know quite well that honours are sold"".",16
324,"In 1913 Lord Selborne tried to mount a campaign against the sale of honours but he had a lukewarm response: Salisbury thought it would not achieve anything useful, Lansdowne urged that the views of the party organizers should be sought, and Law urged him ""not to obscure the Marconi issue"" .",16
325,"Law knew that ""a year's peerages have been hypothecated"" even before he became leader, and he probably knew that the party could not do without this source of income.",16
326,"It was also useless to pretend that corruption at  elections was one-sided; the scale was far smaller than thirty years earlier, but it went on just the same in both parties.",16
327,"Marconi thus had a special importance because it provided an issue of corruption that could not be turned back by Liberals against the Unionists, and for this the Liberals had only themselves to blame.",16
328,"Asquith's appointment of Isaacs as Lord Chief Justice just a few months after he had narrowly escaped (and actually deserved) parliamentary censure, was a brave example of loyalty to a colleague, but it also demonstrated exactly the insensitivity that Unionists had denounced.",16
329,"This ambivalence towards public morality was crucial when set alongside the Unionists""extra-legal activities over Ireland.",16
330,It was the campaign doors over Ulster that was the centre piece of the whole Unionist campaign.,16
331,"For all the noise and fury, the Home Rule Bill was passed by the Commons in January 1913 and again in July, and would become law in the autumn of 1914.",16
332,"If it were to be stopped , then it could only be by means that fell entirely outside the constitution.",16
333,"The first such means involved the King and the second the army, but both rested on the assertion that Ulster would not accept Home Rule.",16
334,"It was argued that the King might intervene either to persuade Asquith to call an election or to refuse his assent to Home Rule until there had been one; this was certainly within the theoretical Royal Prerogative, for the King had an undoubted right to advise his ministers and — by the Unionist argument — his power of veto had been necessarily restored by the removal of the powers of the Lords.",16
335,"Only the King could now give his people the right to vote on a divisive issue, a situation that naturally appalled the Palace.",16
336,"Law pessimistically told the King that he would in any case alienate half of his subjects, Unionists if he gave his assent to Home Rule and Liberals if he did not.",16
337,"Such warnings succeeded in bringing the King into the negotiations; by 1914 the King was trying to secure a compromise settlement, in itself a major advance for an opposition.",16
338,"It was the second Unionist lever against Home Rule that helped to involve the King, for it assumed that Home Rule would become law, would be repudiated in Ulster, and that then the army would refuse to enforce it.",16
339,"The resistance of Ulster had not been created by British Unionists and could hardly be said to depend on them, but the knowledge of support was certainly useful to Carson and Craig in giving their plans for rebellion an official look.",16
340,"At Blenheim in July 1912 Law spoke to a mass rally of English Unionists, including over a hundred MPs, and made his commitment to Ulster absolutely specific.",16
341,"Categorically, he argued that force in Ulster would overthrow parliamentary majorities if necessary and he assured the party's support in advance with no limitations.",16
342,"In a similar rally in Belfast in April he had taken the salute from over 100,000 Protestants in military formation.",16
343,"He went on to commit the party the creation of the Ulster volunteers, of the formation of a Provisional government, and of the gun-running at Larne in April 1914.",16
344,"Again and again he spelled out his commitment — almost always  linked to the question of the mandate, as in the Commons in January 1913:",16
345,Suppose we submit it to the electors?,16
346,"I say that, so far as I am concerned.",16
347,"if that is done we shall not in any way, shape or form encourage the resistance of Ulster.",16
348,I say that without hesitation.,16
349,[MR WINSTON CHURCHILL: Are you encouraging it now?],16
350,I rather differ from the Rt Hon.,16
351,Gentleman.,16
352,I am never ashamed to say exactly what I am doing.,16
353,"I have said before, and if it be any satisfaction to him I repeat it now, that if you attempt to enforce this Bill, and the people of Ulster believe, and have a right to believe, that you are doing it against the will of the people of this country, then I shall assist them in resisting it.",16
354,"Not only would Ulster be right to resist, but so would army officers who refused to enforce the decision of parliament:",16
355,Put yourselves in the position of an officer.,16
356,"He believes in his heart and conscience, as I do, that the Government are doing this thing without the consent of the country, that in pressing it forward without the approval of the country they are as much a revolutionary committee as President Huerta who governs Mexico.",16
357,"That is really my position and, unless I believed in it I would not feel justified in the course I have taken.",16
358,"Unlimited support was promised, and unlimited support was given; that was indeed the only way in which the strategy of stopping Home Rule ""doors"" might succeed.",16
359,"Behind the scenes though, neither Law nor his party was so sure of the grounds and there was certainly some fear of the consequences.",16
360,Austen Chamberlain represented such fears when he told Willoughby de Broke of what might be yet to come in November 1913:,16
361,"Civil War is an awful thing, not to be lightly encountered, but it is not the greatest evil which confronts us if the coercion of Ulster is tried.",16
362,"For if that is done, the House of Commons v. the Amy will break in the process.",16
363,"If officers throw up their commissions and troops refuse to fire, Home Rule is dead, but else is dead too.",16
364,"I won't dwell on the dangers of foreign complications, real though they be, but how will you meet another general strike on the railways or in the mines?",16
365,It is not civil war that is the greatest peril but anarchy.,16
366,"And despite his public utterances Law too was ready to take up a more pragmatic attitude when negotiating; if Ulster could be excluded, he was quite prepared to abandon the rest of Ireland to Home Rule; Carson shared Law's view and was kept the negotiations throughout.",16
367,"Two problems intervened though to prevent a compromise, both in the secret negotiations of 1913 and the Buckingham Palace talks of July 1914.",16
368,On the Unionist side men who had been fed with the heady talk of absolute resistance mobilized to resist what they now saw as the sell-out of the Southern Irish Unionists.,16
369,"The diehard peers began to organize another revolt, and the threat of a split like 1911 loomed.",16
370,This gravely restricted Law's room for manoeuvre and made it impossible for him to accept the only compromise that Asquith could offer.,16
371,"On the Liberal side, anger at the illegal campaign against Home Rule had made it equally difficult for Asquith to compromise, and he too could see no other way forward.",16
372,"By 1914 the terms of a possible compromise were emerging, by which Unionists would accept Home Rule and Liberals would agree to exclude Ulster; argument continued over the exact size of an excluded Ulster and the length of time involved in exclusion, but the logic of the negotiations pointed to this settlement in 1914 just as it was to do in 1921–22.",16
373,The tragedy of 1914 was that neither side could accept this obvious compromise because neither could sell it to their own followers.,16
374,"Law had indeed brought Asquith to the point of conceding all that could be hoped for from Ulster's resistance, but he was unable to seize the fruits.",16
375,"He believed that Asquith ""is in a funk about the resistance of Ulster, and I am convinced that he will not face it when it comes to the point"" .",16
376,"Compromise having failed, there was left only force.",16
377,The final Unionist weapon would then be the army and the last political tactic was the scheme to amend the annual Army Bill in the House of Lords.,16
378,"As this was a Bill that was passed for one year only, the refusal to pass it would effectively restore the Lords' power over the government by taking away its legal control over the army.",16
379,"In the early months of 1914 the Unionist leaders prepared for this desperate throw, and the plan was only abandoned when the ""mutiny"" at the Curragh showed that it was unnecessary, for the officers would not in any case agree to coerce Ulster.",16
380,"The Curragh incident was a sad case of panic, bungling and hesitation by the Liberals, for which the Unionists bear only an indirect responsibility, but once the crisis broke the Unionists were quite convinced that it was the result of a plot against loyal Ulster an ""Ulster Pogrom"" .",16
381,"Movements of the fleet, secret meetings at the War Office, and the equivocations of the Prime Minister all lent some credence to this view, but there is no doubt that the Unionists themselves believed it.",16
382,"Unable to accept concessions in negotiation, Law now saw much the same deal offered by the Liberals themselves, when Asquith announced an Amending Bill to satisfy Ulster's fears of Home Rule with a period of exclusion.",16
383,"There remained doubt about the length of the exclusion, but it would certainly go past the next election and so allow a Unionist government to make it permanent.",16
384,"The campaign of resistance had then succeeded, but few Unionists were celebrating; Lord Winterton in Sussex and Willoughby de Broke in Warwickshire were among the Unionists who were preparing to spread an Irish civil war to England by setting up ""commandos"" of diehards among the yeomanry — but it was not clear whom they would fight if the army refused to support the government.",16
385,With the failure of the Buckingham Palace Conference in July 1914 the party prepared to redeem the pledges to Ulster of the past three years.,16
386,From this grim situation the party was saved by the First World War.,16
387,The verdict on Bonar Law's first three years as leader must be a two-sided one.,16
388,From the national viewpoint there are some credits and one massive debit.,16
389,It was Law's achievement to keep the extreme right within the mainstream of the political system when it might have felt the need to  abandon party politics altogether.,16
390,It is the particular genius of British politics that the major parties have always managed to hold on to their respective extremists and so to draw their teeth.,16
391,This was never more threatened from the right than in the years before 1914 and a leader who had respected constitutional niceties at that time would have driven them the system where they could have been far more dangerous.,16
392,Law's campaign against Home Rule also brought the Liberal government face to face with power politics and showed up the hollowness of the reasoned optimism that underlay Edwardian Liberalism.,16
393,"The First World War provided a similar test and again only the Labour and Unionist parties were able to meet it squarely, but the battles of 1912 and 1913 had given advance warning of what was to come.",16
394,The imperial and defence campaigns perhaps did something to prepare the nation for war and they certainly prepared the parry to take the lead when war did come in 1914.,16
395,"Against these points must be set the fatalism with which Law watched his country drift into civil war; the patriotic party became begetters of rebellion, the party of order suborned crime and mutiny, and the leader of the opposition in parliament approved and supported the destruction of both the practice and the authority of parliament.",16
396,"It should not be thought that Unionists enjoyed such a situation, for they certainly did not, but nor can it be suggested that they saw any real alternative, for in truth the basis of agreement on which parliamentary government""rested had broken down.",16
397,"So Law said of the Liberals in 1914: ""They have become revolutionaries, and becoming revolutionaries they have lost the right to that implicit obedience that can be claimed by a Constitutional Government."" ",16
398,"In this Law shared the view of his party, but it would have been substantially the same without him.",16
399,It is indeed hard to see how any Unionist leader in these years could have acted against such firm convictions to put the national interest first.,16
400,"From the party point of view, Law's leadership had been a considerable success.",16
401,"He inherited a party that was weak and unsure of itself, he raised its morale, gave it purpose and pulled it together.",16
402,Without this revival before 1914 it is difficult to see how the parry could have survived the ten turbulent years that followed.,16
403,"By 1914 Unionists again really believed in their cause, as few had done in 1911.",16
404,By 1914 the Liberal party was on the ropes and the Unionists could look forward confidently to the election that could not be long delayed.,16
405,Debate has been fierce between Liberal and Labour historians what can be proved from the by-elections of 1911–14 about the relative strength of the two Progressive parties; it is an indecisive argument in its very nature the confused pattern of results and the lack of any truly comparable figures for 1910 or 1906.,16
406,"What cannot be doubted is that Unionists, who had drawn level with the Liberals in 1910, had made up more ground on them since.",16
407,"By the outbreak of war, the party had 287 MPs, thirty more than the Liberals and almost as many as the combined Liberal-Labour vote.",16
408,"Of these by-election  gains more than half had been in straight fights, the implications of which were unmistakable.",16
409,"An article in Our Flag in November 1912 pointed out that the average turnover of votes in by-elections had been about 1,300 votes per contest and that only 250 votes per contest was needed for an overall Unionist majority.",16
410,So in straight fights the Unionists were apparently on their way to a big win and the Labour-Liberal battles in three-cornered contests were merely an added bonus.,16
411,"Local elections confirmed the trend and their historian has interpreted them as showing that ""by 1913, the Conservatives had rarely been stronger in the Councils of the land, or indeed more poised for success in the forthcoming general election"" .",16
412,"Much would depend on the exact state of affairs in Ireland and something would depend on the success of the Progressive parties in patching up a new electoral pact (although after the events of 1912 and 1913 it could not be expected to work as well as in 1910), but all of these factors would operate in the broad context of a probable Unionist victory.",16
413,"So in saving the party from a desperate situation in Ireland, the First World War also robbed the Unionist party of a return to power.",16
414,Bonar Law's Party,16
415,"Bonar Law was a startling choice for the party of the ""Hotel Cecil"" , for he was a self-made and almost self-educated businessman from the outlying parts of the Empire (Scotland, Ulster and Canada provided his roots).",16
416,He was inexperienced and little known before he was propelled into the highest office by his friends' ambition for him and by the deadlock between Long and Chamberlain in 1911.,16
417,"He had entered parliament in 1900, twenty-six years after Balfour, he had held no Cabinet post, he had taken no active role in party institutions, and he had not involved himself much in the social world of Westminster.",16
418,"However, his candidature in 1911 had been aided by three factors: he was a Conservative a Liberal Unionist, but he was the sort of Conservative who would be acceptable to Liberal Unionists ; he was a diehard in opinion, but he had remained loyal to Balfour's policy throughout the recent twists and turns; and he had staked a claim by his abandonment of his safe London seat to fight North-West Manchester in December 1910 (at no real risk, for an alternative safe seat was always available to him if and when he lost).",16
419,"Law's claims were therefore substantial, but they were known to few outside parliament, Glasgow and Manchester.",16
420,"In welcoming him, the party thus welcomed him as a stereotype.",16
421,"One thing about him that was widely known was the fact that he was a businessman, and so it was as he was welcomed; the party could even claim some credit for being the first to elect a businessman as its leader — much as it claimed credit in 1975 for electing a woman, although Margaret Thatcher had certainly not been chosen for that reason.",16
422,"At the National Union rally at Leeds the week after Law's election, a local delegate called John Gordon remarked that Law was ""a man of enormous business capacity (Hear, hear)"" , and suggested that there should be more such men in parliament.",16
423,"On the previous day, Alfred Hobson of Sheffield had told a party lunch that",16
424,"they had been fortunate in securing a businessman, whose qualifications in that respect would certainly appeal to men in the North of England.",16
425,"(Hear, hear).",16
426,", we did not pay the same attention to the commercial development of our country that other nations paid to their development on those lines.",16
427,We wanted more businessmen at the head of affairs.,16
428,"Others who were less impressed by what they knew about Law were  surprised by what they discovered of his actual abilities, perhaps because his anonymity had prepared them for the worst.",16
429,"Lady Dawkins, who had never heard him speak before, surprised herself by her reaction when she heard him speak at the Albert Hall in January 1912:",16
430,It was a splendid meeting yesterday and they gave Bonar Law a magnificent reception.,16
431,"His delivery was extraordinarily good and, though he spoke for an hour and a half I should think, his voice never failed him and every word was clear — and bold.",16
432,"It wasn't brilliant oratory, no flowers of rhetoric Curzon, or subtle ""nuances"" Balfour, but it was good hard sound commonsense and the way he showed up the government was admirable.",16
433,"What I liked about it was that though it was biting sarcasm, the way he spoke it gave you the impression not of a man who was bitter in any way, but of a man who pitied the members of the government for being so rotten and pitied us for being governed by such scum.",16
434,He held his audience all through his speech you felt he was in touch and in sympathy with them and they with him.,16
435,"He was so extraordinarily quiet and self-possessed, it was almost he were chatting to us confidentially about it all making an elaborate speech.",16
436,"I am bound to say that his personality and his voice with his Glasgow accent were disconcerting (I felt rather I were being addressed by my highly educated carpenter), but he inspired me with such confidence as he went on that I forgot that, and one has to recognise that a new era in political life has dawned for England, the old aristocratic school is practically swept it, it is the dawn of the new ""regime"" .",16
437,"we are in safe hands, while we are with a sincere man like B.L.",16
438,"we are safe, but I am not sure that it is a good thing on the whole.",16
439,"Still, I suppose we must move with the times.",16
440,This account sums up much of Law's appeal and explains his quick success as leader.,16
441,"He combined a cold approach with references to emotive issues like the Boer War, he spoke in a matter-of-fact way, he made clever use of sarcasm at the expense of opponents, and he recognized the value of a decisive attitude that would be firmly grasped by a party audience.",16
442,"His unconventionality, his unorthodoxy and his accent all helped the party to feel that it had made a step forward: ""the dawn of the new regime"" .",16
443,"As Lloyd George perceptively remarked in 1911, ""the fools have stumbled on the right man by accident"" .",16
444,"Bonar Law has usually received a bad press from historians, who have portrayed him as a hard, dour, humourless fanatic.",16
445,"The balance was righted by Robert Blake's biography, a book of great judgement and insight but still without great sympathy for the man.",16
446,For it is the personality of Law that has remained as elusive to historians as it was to his own contemporaries.,16
447,"He remained a very private individual during his twelve years at the top, rarely venturing into society and always preferring a quiet dinner alone or with chosen friends to an elaborate occasion.",16
448,"After the death of his wife in 1909 he took no interest in the society of women, he had little interest in food and he was a teetotaller.",16
449,As leader of the party he gave the usual dinner for colleagues at the start of the session but he was happy to leave the rest of the social management of the party to Lady Londonderry.,16
450,"He was obliged to  attend some party functions and to receive the chief guests the hostess, but he received little pleasure from such occasions and rarely attended them outside London.",16
451,His lack of social.,16
452,"graces could be an embarrassment, for he had no polite small-talk and did not pretend to any; his visits to Windsor were an ordeal for guest and hosts alike, to him because he disliked formality and to his hosts because he was so difficult to entertain and because he did not mince words with the King.",16
453,"He thus remained an enigma, a man who could not be known as most politicians were known and who seemed to shun such contacts.",16
454,The outward appearance of gloomy taciturnity was therefore taken for the whole man.,16
455,"To friends, though, Law appeared very differently, and the people who became his friends provide testament to the fact; he was very close with both Max Aitken and David Lloyd George, neither of whom was very likely to enjoy the company of a gloomy boor.",16
456,"Indeed, when Law left the government in 1921, Frances Stevenson noted in her diary that Lloyd George had ""lost an ideal companion with whom he could laugh and joke and enjoy himself"" .",16
457,Both Aitken and Stanley Baldwin had an admiration for Law that bordered on veneration.,16
458,"Others never managed to penetrate his reserve, for he had a deep suspicion of others who could turn out a compliment at will or turn a barbed shaft with a sally of their own, and above all he hated pomposity and egotism; this goes far to explain his view of Churchill and of F. E. Smith.",16
459,"When offered the leadership for which he had fought so hard, Law almost lost It by his apparent doubt; in his speech of acceptance he spoke of his unfitness for the job; when told that he was now a great man and must learn to behave like one, he replied ""If! am a great man, then a good many great men must have been frauds."" ",16
460,Indeed Law determined not to try to look like a great man and therein lay the secret this success.,16
461,"He put himself forward as a self-consciously ordinary man, a politician who asked to be identified with as an equal deferred to as a leader.",16
462,"Even Lloyd George, whose origins were as lowly as Law's had been, could not stoop to so humble a style, and only Stanley Baldwin (who drew much of his inspiration from Law) was able to do so successfully.",16
463,"If Law had a political model, then it must have been Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, a fellow Scot who had shown that an ordinary man could hold the highest office without discredit and that he could beat the clever and the politically sophisticated at their own game.",16
464,Commentators on Bonar Law's election to the leadership all agreed that the party had taken a decisive turn.,16
465,"For Walter Long proposing Law as leader, the decision marked the end of an era, the swansong of the country gentleman.",16
466,"For H. G. Wells, the change to Bonar Law marked a distasteful new attitude by the Unionists; when Balfour's""essential liberalism came face to face with this new baseness of commercialized imperialism, with all its push and energy, he made a very poor fight for it.",16
467,"He allowed himself to be hustled into the background of affairs by men with narrower views and nearer objectives.""",16
468,As far back as 1904 Winston Churchill had foreseen the  same change when he predicted the tariff reformers' coming takeover of the party.,16
469,"Lord Robert Cecil detected the same change when he deplored the tariff reformers'""whole way of looking at things.",16
470,"It appears to me utterly sordid and materialistic, not yet corrupt but on the high road to corruption.""",16
471,"Tory aristocrats, Liberals and Fabians all saw in Law's election the triumph of this ""new mercantile Conservatism"" and the final triumph of tariff reform; the party was now in the hands of hard-faced businessmen, and all sorts of undesirable results would inevitably follow.",16
472,"Law gave credence to such fears by his unashamed espousal of the image created round him; in May 1912 he told the National Union that ""nobody knows better than I do that political work cannot be done on strictly business lines, but the nearer you can approach to business lines the better for the political work"" .",16
473,"Steel-Maitland was running Central Office like a business enterprise, not to make a political point, but because it was as natural to him as it had been foreign to Percival Hughes.",16
474,"The party magazine Conservative and Unionist quite specifically welcomed Law's election, because ""as a great captain of industry, his knowledge of the conditions of the workers will be an invaluable guide in the development of the Unionist policy of Social Reform"" .",16
475,"The resistance of Ulster was also linked to its business roots with such slogans as ""Industrial Ulster is united"" or ""They mean business"" , and Law made the same point when he described in Norwich a recent meeting that he had addressed in the Ulster Hall:",16
476,That meeting consisted of practically the whole business community of Belfast.,16
477,"They are the very class which hate disorder, which know that disorder injures their business, perhaps ruins their business, yet this class showed an enthusiasm which equalled, if not surpassed, the enthusiasm of the workers in the shipyards.",16
478,The merging of Conservatives and Liberal Unionists was described by John Boraston on similar lines:,16
479,"The promoters of the amalgamation are a body of keen businessmen, well knowing the difference between an investment and a speculation.",16
480,"They regard the fusion as a sound investment and, although Unionist stock has appreciated greatly since the new issue, there is not a man of us who has the slightest intention of selling out.",16
481,So under Law the language of the boardroom became commonplace on the platforms and in the propaganda of the party.,16
482,There has rarely been a clearer example of the extent to which a Conservative leader sets the keynote for the party the extent to which it is moulded round its leader.,16
483,"In all this, it was easy to forget the fortuitous circumstances in which Law had actually become leader in 1911.",16
484,"Walter Long was a country gentleman who played that image for all he was worth, using Henry Chaplin-""the squire — as his political model.",16
485,"Austen Chamberlain had been trained to be a conventional statesman; Rugby, Cambridge and a determination to live down his father's reputation had all combined to make him the most conformist of politicians.",16
486,"Neither Long not Chamberlain would have made great changes in  the party, and the election of either would not have seemed to signify a great change.",16
487,"Moreover they and their supporters were still present in Bonar Law's party, the scale of the real change would be heavily circumscribed.",16
488,"Law could give his party a new image, but the reality would remain much as before.",16
489,"The leadership was actually a collective one a personal domination, and Law recognized his obligation to take the advice of those who were seen to be worthy of consultation by the party as a whole.",16
490,"He called the shadow cabinet together rarely and restricted its membership, but this did not remove the obligation to take advice.",16
491,We must turn to Law's leading supporters to himself to assess the real character of the party.,16
492,"Our Flag printed New Year messages in 1914 from Lansdowne, Bonar Law, Selborne, Austen Chamberlain, Long, Carson, Smith, Steel-Maitland, Lord Edmund Talbot, and George Younger, in that order; the last three were presumably included as Party Chairman, Chief Whip and Scottish Whip, but the rest of the list may be taken as indicative of a rough order of precedence at that time.",16
493,"Lansdowne came first because he had been leader in the House of Lords since 1902; he was too old to be a rival to Law and he cooperated with him fully, though not without some condescension.",16
494,He played a vital role because the Lords were central to Unionist tactics and because the only alternative leaders there — Selborne or Curzon — had each alienated some Unionist peers by their actions in 1911.,16
495,"Law consulted Lansdowne on all matters of importance, kept him informed of the progress of negotiations over Ulster, but found him difficult to convince of the merits of compromise.",16
496,Lansdowne was more exposed to the views of the real diehards and was thus a restraining influence on Law.,16
497,"With Lansdowne should be linked Balfour who, though he occupied no official position after 1911, was still close to the centre of the party.",16
498,"Relations with Law were cool but courteous and his tactical advice was always available on difficult issues, the question of the Army Act in 1914.",16
499,"Selborne was of significance because he was a man who had a foot in every camp; related to the Cecils, he was also a Liberal Unionist, a tariff reformer, a diehard, and a Liberal Unionist.",16
500,"He had been Liberal Unionist Chief Whip, with Joseph Chamberlain at the Colonial Office, First Lord of the Admiralty, Milner's successor in South Africa, and a ditcher over the House of Lords.",16
501,In 1914 he was still only fifty-five and could look forward to a major job in the next Unionist government.,16
502,"He had not wished to leave the Commons when he inherited his title in 1895 and thereafter he became an unceasing advocate of the House of Lords, defending its powers, resisting the sale of peerages, and demanding its reconstruction its powers could be restored.",16
503,"Austen Chamberlain and Walter Long were both treated with respect by Law, tribute to their withdrawal in his favour in 1911, but they reacted very differently.",16
504,"Long was a choleric, short-tempered man who was a constant trial to colleagues in opposition or in power.",16
505,He bad a good platform manner and a  great capacity for work but he was an inveterate intriguer.,16
506,"He had constantly worked against Balfour, criticizing him freely in letters to colleagues and using his party positions as independent bases against the leader.",16
507,"From 1912 though, his health was not good and he was no real threat to Law, but he retained the backing of a large section of the rank and file in the House of Commons.",16
508,Austen Chamberlain on the other hand was always reserved and never seems to have fully understood Law's belief in his party nor his readiness to sacrifice even profound beliefs for the sake of unity.,16
509,He was hurt by his failure to win the leadership in 1911 and by the hostility to his family manifested during the contest.,16
510,"He made it clear to Law that he did not think that Law was well qualified to be leader and that he reserved the right to contest any future vacancy, but Austen was too loyal a man to conspire; relations were not very friendly, but there was total cooperation.",16
511,Sir Edward Carson occupied an independent position as the spokesman of Ulster.,16
512,"Although not an Ulsterman himself, he gave to Ulster the charismatic lead that transformed resistance into armed rebellion, and he was a popular platform speaker with Unionists on both sides of the Irish Sea.",16
513,"Although the leader of the Union Defence League in succession to Walter Long, he shared Law's belief in the inevitability of ultimate compromise, and this made him, like Law, an object of suspicion to the diehard Irish Unionists.",16
514,F. E. Smith worked closely with Carson in the Ulster campaign.,16
515,"He was the rising man in the party, only thirty-nine in 1911 when he joined the front bench, as brilliant an advocate as Carson and a man of devastating wit.",16
516,"He was the most popular Unionist speaker after Law in 1912 and 1913, the man that every local association wanted to open their bazaars and fates.",16
517,"His speeches in parliament were separately published, as were those of no other Unionist of the time except Balfour, and he received the signal honour of a Privy Councillorship on the recommendation of the Liberal Prime Minister in June 1911.",16
518,"These then were Law's senior colleagues in the work of opposition and would have presumably occupied the senior posts in a Law government; they scarcely add the image of a party of ruthless businessmen and, if other probable ministers are added to the list — Lords Derby, Curzon, Salisbury and Crawford, together with Finlay and Cave, both lawyers — then it seems even less so.",16
519,"The only Unionists who conformed to the picture of what the party was supposed to be like were either men outside the mainstream like Milner, or men too junior to have much real influence like Steel-Maitland, Aitken, Amery and Goulding.",16
520,"Bonar Law himself was the only one of the shadow cabinet who fitted the image of his party, and for him part , was assumed for the occasion.",16
521,"Most of the party leaders were in any case inherited from Balfour and it would take time to find men of the new stamp, this were possible.",16
522,"The Balfourites did gradually fade from the scene; Acland-Hood, Wyndham and Lyttleton all died, Halsbury and Akers-Douglas became too old, and Midleton was dropped.",16
523,"But in their place, Law did not fill his shadow cabinet with assertive businessmen.",16
524,"Far from it, for even after  the influx into parliament of the ""hard-faced men"" of 1918 the Law government of 1922 included as many old-established peers as any of the time.",16
525,"Salisbury had remarked in 1911 that ""whatever your own opinions, the Conservative party can only assimilate change gradually"" , and this was certainly so in the case of personnel at the top.",16
526,A Law government in 1915 would have included hardly any more MPs from a business background than Disraeli's 1874 Ministry or Salisbury's of 1895.,16
527,"Not all members would have been aristocratic or from the gentry, but the fastest route to the top was still through the law through commerce.",16
528,"Unionist MPs in 1910–14 have been exhaustively studied by J. M. McEwen and J. A. Thomas, and the following analysis is based on their work.",16
529,The clearest characteristic of the parliamentary party was its strongly regional base.,16
530,"Unionists held 54 of the English seats, but only 18 of the rest, and this severely limited the recovery from 1906.",16
531,"Ireland outside Ulster was intractable, but the lack of a Unionist revival in Scotland and Wales cost the party about thirty seats when compared to 1895 or 1900.",16
532,"Within England too there was a heavy concentration: the party held most of the seats in the Home Counties, Wessex, the West and the West Midlands; just over half in London, the East and the North-west; well under half in the East Midlands and North.",16
533,"Strength was still predominantly in the counties; the English counties returned almost half of the parliamentary party, the squires who made Walter Long such a force, and of these 128 MPs over a hundred owned land or lived in the division that they represented, a strong territorial base.",16
534,"This was further reflected by the fact that a third of the MPs did not keep up a house in London, confirmation of roots outside Westminster; sessions lasted for only about thirty weeks a year and even during session the attendance of backbenchers was sometimes spasmodic.",16
535,"Unionists had a slight majority of the English borough seats, but this was based on the small towns of the West and South the heavy industrial centres of the North.",16
536,"The Unionist preponderance in London rested on the western residential suburbs, eighteen constituencies that elected Unionists at all elections from 1885 to 1910.",16
537,"Of the major cities only Birmingham, Liverpool and Sheffield elected more Unionists than Liberals in 1910, but Unionism was also strong in Plymouth Brighton, Preston, and Bath.",16
538,"Where old cries could still be made to work, old strongholds in the seaside resorts, cathedral towns, market towns and suburbs returned to their previous loyalty.",16
539,"Where the joint appeal of Liberals and Labour had bitten more deeply into the Unionist vote there was no visible recovery of ground; so in 1914 there were no Unionist MPs from Leeds or Bradford, Leicester or Derby or Stoke, Newcastle upon Tyne, Sunderland, Southampton, Stockport, Bolton, Blackburn or Northampton.",16
540,Every one of these towns had returned Unionists in 1895 or 1900 and no Unionist government would be elected without some victories in such places.,16
541,The by-election gains in Manchester in 1912 and in Ipswich on the eve of the war perhaps showed  that this recovery was at hand.,16
542,"The borough MPs were very different from their county colleagues, and only thirty-seven of the eighty-six from English boroughs even lived in the same towns; many were carpet-bagging lawyers, induced to stand at the last moment and at the expense of Central Office.",16
543,"This distribution was much like that of the 1880s: the reliance on the counties, the growth of suburban strength, and the lack of strong local roots in the industrial areas were all traditional features.",16
544,In background the party was less exclusive than might be expected.,16
545,Only nineteen MPs were heirs to peerages and of these seven were from families that had been Liberal before 1886 and another five were new creations since then; thirty-eight MPs were related to peers by blood and another forty by marriage.,16
546,"Only sixteen Unionist MPs were baronets (less than the number of Liberals, a testament to the eight years of Liberal government), and these were the owners of new wealth old titles.",16
547,"There were twenty-one knights, but these too were more often lawyers, merchants and colonial administrators landed gentry.",16
548,"Eighty-one MPs had some connection with a landed family (on Burke's celebrated definition) and fifty-five of these sat for seats that were their family holdings; conversely there were only two whose fathers had been working-class (Jessie Collings and Henry Duke) but a host whose fathers had been lawyers, clergymen or doctors (including Law, Smith and Aitken).",16
549,"Fifty-three were the sons of MPs (18 , much like the 17 of Liberals) and twelve of these sat for the same seat, although few like Stanley Baldwin succeeded directly; fifteen of these fifty-three were sons of Liberals, further evidence of the value of recruits brought over in 1886.",16
550,"Unionists were most distinct from Liberals and from other generations of Conservatives in their age; the average age was only fifty in 1914, there were four Unionist MPs under thirty and sixty-two under forty, and half of the party had been under forty when first elected.",16
551,This reflected the extent to which politics was a career that followed quite naturally from station and the clearing out that had taken place after 1906.,16
552,"Few Unionist MPs had any need to earn their livings, and it was usually the lawyers and businessmen who were the older members.",16
553,"The parliamentary party was thus a relatively young group of men, with the most privileged also the youngest.",16
554,"In education the party conformed more to what would be expected: 196 MPs had been to public schools (68 of the party, twice the proportion of Liberals) and eighty-six of these had been at Eton, almost a third of the party.",16
555,"Only thirty-four had been to other secondary schools, scarcely more than the number from the second most popular public school, Harrow.",16
556,"The same pattern can be seen in higher education, with 144 Unionists going to Oxford or Cambridge (88–53 to the dark blues), again twice the proportion of Liberals.",16
557,"A few had been to other universities, to Sandhurst, Dartmouth or an agricultural college, making 190 in all who had had some form of higher education.",16
558,The educational background of the party thus suggests a single  integrated elite still drawing heavily on the most exclusive sources.,16
559,"The difficulty of interpreting such information is highlighted though by the fact that this educated elite, two-thirds of whom had been to public schools and universities, chose as their leader a man who had been to neither.",16
560,"The problem of interpretation is compounded in considering MPs occupation and interests; it was not unusual for a young man from a landed family to be called to the Bar (but not to practice), to serve in the armed forces (but not to become a professional soldier), and then to settle down to a political career with several directorships.",16
561,"It would be misleading to classify such a man as ""lawyer"" , ""officer"" or ""businessman"" .",16
562,"So 156 MPs had some identifiable business interest, over half of the party, but for most of them some other interest seemed to predominate.",16
563,"Occupations are therefore given, these limitations of interpretation, in Table 5.1, with the figures for Liberals as a comparison.",16
564,"Table 5.1 Occupations of Unionist MPs and Liberals, 1914 Unionist Liberal Land Large landowners 32 9 Small landowners 19 3 Heirs to estates 16 4 67(23%) 16(6%) Official services Army 53 15 Navy 2 1 Diplomatic 5 4 Civil Service 3 4 63(22%) 24(9%) Professions Barristers 79 59 Solicitors 12 12 Authors/Journalists 7 13 Printers/Publishers 2 10 Lecturers/Teachers 3 10 Others — 7 103(36%) 111(43%) Commerce Merchants 14 24 Stockbrokers 6 3 Bankers 7 4 Insurance 1 3 Accountants 3 1 Others 9 6 40(14%) 41(16%)  Industry Manufacture 7 18 Shipowners 2 8 Textiles 2 14 Iron 6 8 Coal 1 8 Engineering 3 5 Building — 2 Brewing 9 1 Working men — 8 30(10%) 72(27%) Land dominated the party, the bulk of which was now made up of officers and lawyers, with army officers and lawyers between them making up almost half the total.",16
565,"In the less prestigious occupations, Unionists were still more likely to have investments in railways, banking or insurance than in coal, textiles or engineering, more likely engage in commerce than in industry.",16
566,"The parliamentary party on the outbreak of the First World War can therefore be seen to be in a rough state of balance, with the interests of land, services, professions and business in a near equality.",16
567,"Any change would be a small one and would only be seen in candidates adopted after the ""new regime"" of 1911 and fighting for the marginal industrial seats of the North.",16
568,"The MPs elected in 1918 came meeting the expectations of 1911 and many of these had indeed been selected as candidates before the war: in 1918 the average age rose sharply (over half were over fifty), the proportion with interests in the land fell, and the proportion with interests in business rose from 24 to 41 .",16
569,This generation of new men might not have been elected the war but they would certainly have been trying to get elected in a general election in 1915.,16
570,"The final characteristic of the MPs that can be traced is religion, which shows as traditional a pattern as any.",16
571,Very few Unionists were Nonconformists and most of these had come into the party from the Liberal Unionist side.,16
572,"There were rather more Presbyterians, a few Roman Catholics and Jews, and an overwhelmingly Anglican majority, 90 of the party.",16
573,"In an age when all Unionists professed some form of religious belief and when Anglicanism was the assumption of those who professed no other form of Christianity in England, some of this may be taken to be assumption conviction.",16
574,"But to exaggerate this would be to misjudge the tone of the party in religious affairs, for if the Church of England was the ""Tory party at prayer"" then the party was also the Church of England in politics.",16
575,"Many Unionist politicians were prominent laymen in their own right, as were Selborne, Joynson-Hicks, Samuel Hoare and Edward Wood.",16
576,The Cecils regarded the protection of the Church as a special family responsibility and Lord Hugh was as moved to indignation by the disendowment of the Church in Wales as by the People's Budget or the attack on the House of Lords.,16
577,"To Selborne it was no more nor less than ""robbing the church"" and many  Unionists saw it in such simple terms.",16
578,"The party's Anglican commitment was as firm as ever before 1914, it was being led for the first time by a man who was not an Anglican himself.",16
579,"Holding the elements of the party together were two factors of a very different kind: the social world of clubland and society cemented the ties between leaders and followers, and the organizational web of the National Union extended the same ties through the country.",16
580,"Bonar Law might dislike the social round and might rarely visit the Carlton Club, but he did not try to change its role.",16
581,Party meetings continued to be held at the Carlton and it played a greater part in holding the party together when the Liberal Unionists joined.,16
582,Other clubs did much the same things for provincial leaders; it was to the Constitutional Club that Salvidge went when in London and it was there that he stayed.,16
583,"It was to the Carlton the Whip's Office that Robert Sanders went to hear the news and discuss political events, and it was to the Carlton too that he went for recreation when the business of the House was too tedious to be borne .",16
584,"Social forces could be used even for directly political purposes, as Sanders himself found when he needed speakers for the South Somerset by-election in 1911; F. E. Smith could in fact be prised the West End only by social pressure:",16
585,A comic little episode about the South Somerset election.,16
586,"I asked F. E. to go down, so did Talbot.",16
587,But he declined on ground of being too busy.,16
588,Doughty the same.,16
589,I then suggested putting the Carnarvons on F.E. This was quite effective — a countess on the doorstep brought F.E. in .,16
590,He is to go down Monday next.,16
591,"Doughty on getting a letter from Carnarvon, actually came and asked to go.",16
592,Curzon was more difficult to drive down to the provinces.,16
593,"as Steel-Maitland reported to Law in 1914: ""sunderland: He says he cannot manage thee distant meetings.",16
594,They are beyond his strength.,16
595,"If we come in, you ought to be kind to him and not ask him to sacrifice his health by taking office.""",16
596,"though the social world played a more nebulous role, oiling the wheels, providing opportunities for informal meetings and leisurely discussions, as Lord Midleton recalled in 1929 when bewailing Baldwin's neglect of such methods:",16
597,"We all know how the week runs away with official interviews and calls, and how difficult it is to remember all the people with whom you ought to keep in touch, but when I think of the number of things which people of different types, like Lady Londonderry and Lady St Helier and others, have got settled by letting people meet at the dinner table, I despair of a man who never sees even those who have been longest in office on any occasion.",16
598,Your statement that he never once consulted you on a church appointment is conclusive.,16
599,"After all, if you happened to be next him after dinner for ten minutes, he would get invaluable hints.",16
600,"A hostess like Lady St Helier, an open-handed host like the Duke of Marlborough at Blenheim, or a fixer like Aitken with a house London, could all be useful in keeping the wheels of party turning.",16
601,The structure of the National Union was a recognition of the reality of,16
602,local powers and in this respect the party resembled less a unitary structure than a collection of private franchises.,16
603,"The authority of the Earl of Derby in the North-west, celebrated in the soubriquet ""King of Lancashire"" , was only the best known of the independent fiefs where the writ of the party leader did not run.",16
604,In 1912–13 Derby demonstrated his power by mobilizing Lancashire to wreck Law's policy on food taxes.,16
605,"Derby used the machinery of the Lancashire provincial Division to gather his forces, but it would be a mistake to see his institutional position as a source of strength; the President of the Lancashire Unionists was a man of influence because he was Earl of Derby and not .",16
606,"He gave authority to the party drawing from it, for the local standing of the Stanleys was altogether independent of party.",16
607,They had consolidated their position since the fifteenth century and had latterly built up an impregnable position in the social infrastructure of the region.,16
608,"A brother of the Earl was MP for Bootle until 1910, when he gave up his seat to Bonar Law after Law's defeat in Manchester.",16
609,Ormskirk and Chorley were both county seats under the family influence and Stanleys had sat for both seats in the recent past.,16
610,"Local parties, local clubs, churches and voluntary organizations were all patronized by Stanleys and proud to have a Stanley as patron.",16
611,"It was inevitable that the Earl should be Lord Lieutenant of the County, and that he should be President of the Lancashire Unionists.",16
612,Part of the basis of this local standing was financial — the generosity with which the family backed local institutions and the land held directly from them — but part was also more intangible influences.,16
613,The Stanleys were careful to place themselves at the head of local opinion ride the county roughshod and their identity of opinion with local Unionists on political and religious matters made them even more powerful.,16
614,"Something of the same territorial influence can be detected in other counties too; in the East Midlands, the spheres of the Dukes of Rutland and Devonshire were rarely challenged.",16
615,"Nor were such examples confined to feudal counties, for family influence could also be seen in boroughs and on occasion even in big cities.",16
616," was a pocket borough of the Rothschilds, Southend was falling under the control of the Guinness family, Plymouth was learning to love the Astors, and Samuel Roberts was building up the influence in Sheffield that was to provide a seat for his family until 1966.",16
617,"A combination of public philanthropy and attention to local interests could yield quick results, even for an outsider like Max Aitken in Ashton-under-Lyne.",16
618,Others were content to wield power in the party machines in the public eye.,16
619,"Salvidge of Liverpool was the best-known example, becoming chairman of the National Union in 1913 and often cited as the only party boss on the American model in English politics, but his authority in Liverpool was no greater than that of Sir James Oddy in Bradford or Sir Percy Woodhouse in Manchester.",16
620,"Such men owed their positions to the constant manipulation of the party machinery — and so confirmed the worst of Ostrogorski's fears; they  sat on every local committee, raised money for the local party, decided the selection of candidates and kept their fingers firmly on the local pulse.",16
621,"The true pinnacle of success in this field was the Chamberlains in Birmingham, who combined an attention to organizational detail with a liking for the lim light.",16
622,"When Neville Chamberlain became Mayor of Birmingham in 1915, he was the eighth member of the family to hold the office in half a century, and he was never to forget the influence of his local roots.",16
623,Even when a cabinet minister he found time to write round for subscriptions for the Birmingham Unionists and to attend their routine meetings.,16
624,"When facing a critical party conference in 1921, Austen Chamberlain had urged Neville to see that suitable people were selected to represent all twelve Birmingham divisions and to pay their expenses to make sure that they got to Liverpool.",16
625,"Birmingham was quite independent of the party and as late as 1929 was not afraid to show its independence: in that year Neville Chamberlain complained bitterly when he discovered that the Party Chairman had written to businesses in Birmingham for contributions to party funds, for this was regarded as poaching from local preserves.",16
626,"In the previous year, Central Office wished to promote Captain Edwards, the chief agent for Birmingham, to be a Central Office district agent, but they were thwarted by the Chamberlains, who wished to keep him to look after Birmingham; Neville Chamberlain arranged to have Edwards paid enough in Birmingham to keep him there and the interests of Birmingham thus prevailed over those of the party as a whole.",16
627,"In organizational terms, the question of local independence was mainly one of finance.",16
628,Central party funds could not pay more than a tiny proportion of the total cost of running a local association in every constituency; not paying the piper they were unable to call the tune.,16
629,"The dangers of dependence on rich men would be and were regularly pointed out: if the local parties were not themselves independent then they would have to turn to rich outsiders to fight their elections for them, as The Times pointed out in 1911:",16
630,"If the local organization after an election remained active, on a permanent basis of annual subscription, with a permanent organizing secretary who would attend to the registration work and become the agent at the next election, a candidate could, and probably would, be selected on his merits, and the constituency would be independent of men whose only merit was their wealth.",16
631,Independence was thus a two-way phenomenon; local parties should be independent not only of central direction but also of individuals.,16
632,"This explains the popularity of Liverpool as a model for local associations after it was publicized in 1911, for Liverpool was popularly believed to exemplify such local independence.",16
633,"So when a new agent was appointed in Ecclesall in 1912 he was recommended as having come from ""the great school of Liverpool, where he worked for Mr James Thompson"" .",16
634,"When the structure of organization in the whole city was reviewed in Sheffield in 1911, it was 10 Salvidge that local Unionists turned for advice, as did the Manchester  Unionists at the same time.",16
635,"When Harold Smith, the brother of F.E., was asked for advice in organization by Huddersfield Unionists, he delivered them a lecture on Liverpool methods, and in the following year they elected F.E. Smith as their President to carry through reforms that would make Huddersfield like Liverpool.",16
636,"When Darwen needed a new agent in 1911, it was to Salvidge Central Office that they turned for help in finding one.",16
637,"Liverpool methods had been universally adopted — and very few areas had the same religious background as Liverpool, the real basis of Salvidge's success — then change would be slow and limited.",16
638,"The most that could yet be achieved was independence from rich outsiders; independence from rich local men was as far away as ever, even in Liverpool.",16
639,"Nor is this surprising when the actual cost of politics is remembered; about $400 a year was needed to finance an effective local party, and this excluded registration or special campaigns.",16
640,"It also excluded the cost of elections, for these were a financial problem for the candidate, not for the local association; in a large county division an election could cost as much as £2,000, and even an unopposed return in a borough would cost a few hundred pounds to the lucky winner.",16
641,"Over a long period then, the cost of elections was still more than the cost of the permanent organization, and this cost was so great as to rule out all but a tiny minority.",16
642,The cost was indeed so great that there were not even enough rich and unsuitable candidates to buy up the nominations.,16
643,"Many seats went uncontested in 1910 the lack of moneyed candidates, and in December Central Office paid out over £100,000 in subsidies.",16
644,"Most of this largesse went to the most hopeless seats, to constituencies where no real preparations had been made, to places where nobody would risk his own money.",16
645,"The effect of this was that Central Office, for all its generosity, did not have much control over the selection of candidates in places where the man selected might actually win, and this did not change much before 1914.",16
646,"Balfour explained this in 1908 over his inability to protect Robert Cecil, ingeniously making a virtue necessity:",16
647,Top talks it rested with me to settle who were to be the Unionist candidates for the constituencies.,16
648,This has never been the Conservative system…,16
649,"Both in theory and in practice we endeavour to have a representative Association in each Division, and on them — and them only — lies the responsibility of selecting their candidate.",16
650,With that choice the Headquarters of the Party never interfere.,16
651,"In 1912 the same principle was reaffirmed to W. A. S. Hewins by Bonar Law, in a letter that was actually drafted for him by Steel-Maitland: ""If a constituency definitely refuses to accept a candidate, the Central Office wish them to do so, they cannot be forced to take action against their will.",16
652,"In the ultimate resort also, the association of a constituency must be held to be the proper exponent of its wishes.""",16
653,"This was not just a polite brush-off, for Steel-Maitland was anxious to find a seat for Hewins (who was a tariff reform professor of economics who would be a great asset in parliament) and finally managed to do so.",16
654,"But Central Office could exert only informal  pressure, since it could neither bully nor bribe its local supporters, and this is exactly what Steel-Maitland set out to do through his district agents.",16
655,Any change would be gradual and for the time local parties were left with a free choice.,16
656,Nothing better illustrates the social balance in the party and the fierce independence of the local parties than the argument about the selection of working-class candidates.,16
657,"Resolutions were passed by the National Union the principle, but as before no local party would put the good intentions into practice.",16
658,"A resolution proposed at the 1912 National Union Conference tells the whole story; originally the resolution approved, ""the candidature of Unionist working men and earnestly recommends the allocation to one of them of a safe and suitable seat at some by-election in the near future, as evidence of the reality of the movement"" .",16
659,"This got to the heart of the matter, the need to make reality pious hopes, and it recognized the propaganda value of a contest between a Labour candidate and a Unionist working man in a critical by-election.",16
660,"One such seat would not seem to be an excessive demand an accepted objective, but it was more than the Conference would accept.",16
661,"Steel-Maitland explained that a working man was being selected at Bolton as the choice of the local party, on that very evening, but he did not approve of such specific commitment as the resolution suggested.",16
662,"The recent reorganization of the party had been carried out because""they wanted to get a real popular element in the direction of the party, but no attempt should be made to interfere autocratically from the H.Q. to the constituencies.",16
663,"Time after time he had pressed the claims of a workingman candidate on a constituency"", but they had properly chosen the man who was considered to be most suitable for the constituency.",16
664,Other delegates supported his view and the motion was amended to read:,16
665,"That this Conference, while recording its desire to see working men in Parliament on the Unionist side, thinks it undesirable that any distinction should be made between them and other members, and therefore expresses the opinion that all Unionist organizations should select and support with all their power the best candidate they can find to represent their constituency, his social and financial status.",16
666,"This was little help: giving a working man equality of opportunity was tantamount to rejecting his claims outright, for the scales of wealth and influence would remain weighted against him.",16
667,Labour's success was based not on equality of opportunity but on the assertion that a working man was more equal than others in his claim to represent the working-class electorate.,16
668,"a Unionist MP had to pay his election expenses, or an association chairman to ""treat"" the party workers, or a constituency delegate to pay his own expenses to a midweek conference, then few working men would ever be selected for any of these posts.",16
669,"The party's real attitude was shown clearly enough in the Conference of 1913, when it reaffirmed its opposition to the payment of MPs (another form of scarcely disguised class discrimination) by  an almost unanimous vote.",16
670,"Funds were organized as before to pay election expenses for working-class candidates, based on Liverpool and Birmingham, and publicised by the Standard and the Morning Post.",16
671,Hampstead Unionists agreed to support one such fund by levying a guinea subscription from all members of their Executive Committee — a decision that says much about the composition of the Executive Committee itself.,16
672,"Monmouth Unionists backed another fund, but for their own candidate they chose the nephew of their president, Lord Tredegar.",16
673,"Bosworth Unionists agreed to accept ""an assisted candidate"" , but only if no ""man of means"" could be found.",16
674,"And in Bolton, where an assisted candidate was selected by an association with a large working-class element, he found himself facing a Liberal a Labour opponent and went down to defeat.",16
675,"In its social character and its local structures, the Unionist party of 1914 was caught in a dilemma.",16
676,"Old antagonisms had been revived by the tariff dispute, but time would heal these wounds and continue the long-term trend towards one homogeneous propertied elite.",16
677,"This would solve many of the party's difficulties inherited from the past, but it would do little to settle the pressing problems of the present and future.",16
678,"The gradual consolidation of wealth in the party was making it more difficult to preserve the classless, ""one nation"" appeal to working-class supporters.",16
679,It was increasingly difficult to appeal to the working man whose vote might put the party back into power without antagonizing the wealthy man whose financial assistance was crucial.,16
680,"Robert Sanders noted exactly this problem when the party had to formulate and answer to Lloyd George's land campaign of 1913: ""A certain number of our party go openly for wage boards.",16
681,"Men like St. Audries and Banbury scout the idea and say ""stick to the farmer who is on our side and never mind the labourers whose votes you won"" t get anyhow"".",16
682,"A crushing Unionist victory in 1915, bringing with it disaster for the Labour party and a major setback for the ""New Liberalism"" might have ended the difficulty, but when the First World War intervened the problem remained.",16
683,War and Coalition,16
684,"""Lloyd George would secure a greater hold on the rank and file of our party and he would also be so dependent on that party after the election that he would permanently be driven into the same attitude towards our Party which Chamberlain was placed in before, with this difference — that he would be the leader of it.",16
685,"That would, however, Jam inclined to think not be a bad thing for our Party and a good thing for the Nation.",16
686,"I am perfectly certain, indeed I do not think any one can doubt this, that our Party on the old lines will never have any future again in this country.""",16
687,"(Bonar Law to Balfour, 5 October 1918).",16
688,The First World War,16
689,"It is often asserted that the First World War rescued the Unionist Party from an impossible position and left it poised to become the dominating force; the war broke up Liberalism and destroyed the Liberal-Labour alliance, so opening the way for Unionism; Lloyd George carried the party to victory in 1918, incurred the odium for the post-war slump and was cast aside ungratefully in 1922.",16
690,"John Stubbs has identified other effects of the war in the growth of backbench activity, the ending of old issues like Ireland and the strengthening of the Unionist case in others, especially tariffs.",16
691,"Such objective judgements have some validity, but they do not distinguish between the positive effects of war and the damaging effects of coalition.",16
692,"In assessing the decline of Liberalism, it is usual to separate the effects of war and coalition, and it is equally necessary in assessing the survival of Unionism.",16
693,"The prospering of Unionism had less to do with the war than is generally assumed, and it was more healthy in 1914 and less certain of prosperity in 1922.",16
694,"Unionists of the time would scarcely have recognized the terms of the debate, for in 1922 the party was still embroiled with Ireland and the House of Lords, held a smaller share of the popular vote than ever before, and was still split as it had been since 1902; few Unionists would have seen the war as a turning-point for the better in the party fortunes.",16
695,"Only after 1922, with the war receding from memory and coalition over, did the party take the decisions that led to its successes of the next twenty years.",16
696,"The good effects of war can be detected only in the long term, and there were bad effects too, while the consequences of coalition for the party were immediate and almost wholly negative.",16
697,"It is necessary then to consider in turn the war, the effects of coalitionism, and the years between the end of coalition and the party recovery in 1924.",16
698,"Conservative recovery after war and coalition does not demonstrate recovery war and coalition, and indeed the opposite might well have been the case.",16
699,"The effect of the war can be seen under five heads, all following from the actual European conflict: the running of the war effort; the advance of Labour; the advent of democracy in 1918; the effect of war on the party structure and organization; and the effect of war on popular attitudes.",16
700,"The advent of war was not seen by Unionists as a need to turn back to a conventional patriotism, for Unionists had never doubted the patriotism of  their previous stance.",16
701,"In resisting Home Rule and arguing for tariffs, Unionists had seen themselves as acting in the interests of nation and empire against a government that had the interests of neither at heart.",16
702,"The war vindicated the anti-German tone of the tariff campaign, the calls for a stronger navy, the demands for national service, and the defence of the army.",16
703,"If Unionists were vindicated by the war, not just in its taking place but in its nature, then by the same token Liberals were exposed.",16
704,"The war took away the unfortunate necessity, as Unionists saw it, to play with fire in the national interest, but it did not materially alter their view of themselves.",16
705,"If the war brought them more popular feeling, then it was not because they had changed, but because popular opinion (or the Liberal-Labour part of it) had seen the light.",16
706,"This was demonstrated in the first political crisis of wartime, a carry over from peacetime.",16
707,Home Rule and Welsh Disestablishment would become law in the autumn of 1914 and there could now be no election to stop this from taking place.,16
708,"Negotiations centred on the need for national unity in the face of an agreed threat, and provided a test of the genuineness of the parties""commitment to the national cause.",16
709,"A political truce was called within a few days of the outbreak of war; a pact to end contested by-elections was first signed on 6 August, and a joint recruiting drive began before the end of the month.",16
710,But the Irish and Welsh issues remained; the National Union agreed to approve the truce only on a strict understanding that both issues would be satisfactorily settled.,16
711,"Unionists demanded that both Bills should be frozen in their present position, as passed but not to become law for the duration, but Asquith would not accept this criticism on his own side.",16
712,"The government thus decided that both Bills would become law, but would then be suspended for the duration.",16
713,"A few Unionists wished to use the Lords to block this procedure, so prompting a constitutional crisis in wartime, but Law and Lansdowne persuaded the shadow cabinet to swallow their feelings.",16
714,"Party opinions were partially assuaged by a protest meeting at the Carlton Club and a demonstration walkout of the Commons by the entire party, but the outcome was not affected, and so Home Rule became law.",16
715,"The success of the party's resistance to Home Rule had been founded on absolute faith that it was the most important issue, but by 1914 this was the case.",16
716,"Nevertheless, the party made only a limited concession; Home Rule's suspension was real, and every attempt to implement it in wartime provoked sufficient Unionist outrage to stop it.",16
717,"Opposition to Home Rule was put on ice for the duration with the Bill, but opposition was as genuine in 1918 as it had been in 1914.",16
718,"In the meantime, the war gave chances to show the responsible nature of the party through its collective action in parliament, through the restraint of its leaders and through the patriotic actions of its individual members.",16
719,"Winston Churchill had welcomed Bonar Law as party leader in 1911 with the reflection that ""if ever a national emergency makes party interests fade, we  shall find in the Leader of the Opposition one who in no fictitious sense places the country and the Empire first"" , a tribute that was certainly justified by Law's role between 1914 and 1918.",16
720,"a hundred Unionist MPs were usually the House on military service, and 125 Unionist agents served in the trenches; the party organization was used in the war effort at no cost to the country; every local party was decimated by volunteers who joined up in the first rush; and at every level, the number who joined up was more than matched by those indirectly involved through recruiting, raising money, running war charities or breeding remounts.",16
721,"The party as a whole proved the reality of its patriotism from the first days of the war, and the logic of this continuation from peacetime was underlined by the speed with which Ulster Unionists rallied to the flag in 1914, and the gallantry with which they died on the Somme in 1916.",16
722,"The war underlined the Unionist belief in the patriotism of the British people and their belief in the failings of the Liberals, but for themselves it merely confirmed what they knew already.",16
723,all criticism of the running of the war was muted and was aimed at measures men.,16
724,"In parliament it was difficult to adjust to the new situation, whereby the party was supposed to abstain from all criticism of the government but had no say in its decisions.",16
725,"Such an open-ended commitment to a government that most Unionists regarded with contempt could hardly last : Law found it convenient to make use of the Unionist Business Committee, constituted in January 1915 as an official opposition group, and he suggested Walter Long as its chairman, so harnessing Long's vindictive powers and giving the party some means of influencing the government without breaking the party truce.",16
726,It was only the first of many devices that articulated party opinion against governments that the party theoretically supported.,16
727,"Unionist concerns were still as much with traditional areas of disagreement with the Liberals as with the War; the UBC made the running with its concern to shield British industry from the war, much as it had previously been intended to protect it through tariffs, and Stanley Baldwin first made his name through its committees.",16
728,"As John Stubbs has written, ""that backbench activism was centred in such an essentially non-landed element of the Conservative Party tends to confirm the view that the party's centre of gravity was increasingly urbanised, commercialised and industrialised"" .",16
729,"It also reflects the fact that many of the younger, landowning county MPs were simply absent from Westminster; as Yeomanry officers they were liable for service in wartime and, although the Yeomanry could not be compelled to serve abroad, few did not volunteer.",16
730,"The UBC was never more than a small minority of the parliamentary party, with a general attendance of about forty, and its influence was more a result of its being first in the field of opposition, than of its numbers or its members""economic power.",16
731,"It is clear though that the economic tide was running very much in the party's direction in 1915–16; in 1915 the first industrial tariffs for half a century were imposed, and by a Liberal Chancellor; in 1916 even the Manchester Chamber of  Commerce joined in the demand for industrial protection, causing the resignation of its chairman in protest at the abandonment of a century of belief in free trade.",16
732,"In parliament, the bitterest domestic dispute concerned one of the oldest issues of all, drink; Lloyd George proposed restrictions on the drink trade to help the war effort, and suggested that the trade should be nationalized.",16
733,"A pilot scheme was introduced but Unionist indignation was fierce, led by Sir George Younger for the brewers.",16
734,"Bonar Law first welcomed the idea as a means of reducing his party's dependence on ""the trade"" , but opposed it when he recognized the scale of party feeling.",16
735,Throughout 1915–16 though the issue of increasing importance was the running of the war.,16
736,"A party that had thrown itself so uncompromisingly into the campaign against Home Rule, and which had long ago accepted the need for ""organization"" in domestic affairs, could hardly accept the leadership by ineffective compromise which was what Asquith offered.",16
737,"Nor could Unionists, who had flocked to the colours in 1914, accept for long inequality of sacrifice when the nation's greatest need was manpower.",16
738,"Unionists had less compunction than Liberals in employing compulsion for desirable ends, and the Milnerite wing of the party had been preaching the gospel of ""national efficiency"" through organization, making a positive virtue of compulsion.",16
739,"Once the war came, and especially after the flow of recruits proved insufficient in 1915, Unionists called for conscription and for a nationally organized war effort.",16
740,the party leaders resisted such demands as being likely to destroy the party truce and so tried to avoid the public discussion of.,16
741,such subjects.,16
742,"In February 1915 the National Union Executive refused to sanction a scheme to use the party agents to find recruits, since it ""might savour of compulsion"" and in April the Committee refused to debate a motion on compulsory service the party truce.",16
743,"In September, the Executive asked to meet Bonar Law to discuss the subject, Unionists were in government, but Law refused any outside discussion until the cabinet had made up its mind.",16
744,"Throughout the winter of 1915–16, Law played for time and stalled demands for a meeting of the Central Council, while Unionist ministers pressed the party case in cabinet.",16
745,"Party opinion was mollified by the Derby Scheme of November 1915, whereby the agents and activists of both parties were used to canvass for recruits; the party organization was turned over entirely to recruiting and the scheme cost the party £29,000.",16
746,"By February 1916 pressure was mounting again, and resolutions calling for compulsory national service were flowing in; the Executive refused to debate them, but passed them Law nevertheless.",16
747,"In cabinet Unionists pressed the Liberals steadily towards a full policy of conscription, which was finally introduced in May.",16
748,"Criticism of the running of the war went on though, and in June the Executive passed a resolution calling for a more active prosecution of the War.",16
749,"The Easter Rising in Dublin and the government's abortive plan to rush through a Home Rule settlement caused an even greater furore; this time  Bonar Law had to agree to a meeting of the Central Council, but only alter the cabinet had dropped the Home Rule idea, and with a stipulation in advance that questions would be allowed but not resolutions.",16
750,"Throughout the autumn, the barrage of criticism went on in parliament and in the party.",16
751,"After Carson resigned from the government in November 1915 he became the acknowledged leader of the hardliners, organized in the Unionist War Committee.",16
752,The UWC was a far more serious threat than the UBC had been: it was entirely outside the control of the party leaders and backed by over a hundred MPs; it was aimed at a government that included Unionists Liberals; and it seemed likely to be a vehicle for the overthrow of Bonar Law by Carson.,16
753,"Its importance was based on two temporary factors, the great Unionist support for its ideas its leaders, and the loyalty of Law to Asquith, which left an opening for Carson.",16
754,"Once Law resolved, after the Nigeria debate of November 1916, that he would work with Carson and Lloyd George to enforce on Asquith the policy that the Unionist MPs wanted, his position was safe.",16
755,"Law's feeling for the sense of the party was less sure than usual in 1916 but, once certain of the party feeling and the national interest, he did not waver in his demand for a different sort of government.",16
756,"Once the political crisis of December 1916 had been weathered and a government had been formed to pursue the Unionist war policy, and with Law himself entrenched at its centre, Unionist support for both Law and for the government remained until the war's end.",16
757,"Agreement on the prosecution of the war remained through 1917 and 1918, and effective opposition to the government passed from the Unionist back benches to the Asquithian Liberals and the House of Lords.",16
758,"From his position as Chancellor, Law could exercise sufficient influence on the domestic management of the war to avoid further problems, and as Leader of the House of Commons and deputy Prime Minister he could also deal with most of the political problems as they arose.",16
759,"So he headed off demands for a capital levy, knowing it to be unacceptable to his party, but Britain nevertheless paid for a higher proportion of the costs of the war from taxation than the other combatants; he was also able to launch the Victory Loan of 1917 at an interest rate of only 5 , having a surer sense of the patriotism of potential subscribers than did the Treasury.",16
760,"There was thus a community of interest in the war between party and government in 1917–18 as there had not been before, and the party was hardly shaken by the secession of a few diehards to form Henry Page Croft's National party.",16
761,"There was no danger that the party would be outflanked on the right the war remained the most pressing national and party interest, and the National party was a complete fiasco.",16
762,Commitment to the war could have become a problem in itself as the chances of victory became remote.,16
763,"Just as Unionists had rejected an Irish compromise in 1914 after years of commitment to Ulster, so they could not envisage anything short of total victory after the national sacrifices since  1914.",16
764,"When Lansdowne communicated his despair about the war to the press in 1917 and called for negotiations, there was a storm of protest.",16
765,"He had been fading from importance for some time, had been replaced as Unionist leader in the Lords by Curzon and was not a minister under Lloyd George.",16
766,"He was now reviled by the party that he had helped to lead for fifteen years; in his own word he was ""excommunicated"" .",16
767,Commitment to the war also determined the Unionist response to Lloyd George's disputes with the generals in the winter of 1917–18.,16
768,"Sympathy was with the generals the Prime Minister, hardly surprisingly past events, but sympathy never went far enough to weaken Lloyd George's position greatly.",16
769,"Haig was saved from dismissal by defenders on the Unionist side, but Robertson's removal caused a small stir, and Unionists voted in force to save Lloyd George's face in the Maurice debate.",16
770,"It was doubly difficult for Unionists to resist the substitution of Sir Henry Wilson for Robertson, for Wilson was the most Unionist of all the General Staff and Robertson had not enjoyed good relations with Unionists; Derby's weakness at the War Office and Law's loyalty to Lloyd George were sufficient to defuse the situation.",16
771,"The dismissal of Haig would have been much more serious, but with Law's advice Lloyd George did not take the risk.",16
772,"Over Maurice's allegations, Unionists voted under no illusions; Maurice had indicted Law Lloyd George, and a packed meeting of the UWC under Carson resolved to back the government, not because they believed its explanations but their belief in the war.",16
773,The only alternative to Lloyd George's lies were Asquith's half measures.,16
774,"There was a continuity then in Unionist attitudes to the war, going on into the post-war years in demands for a harsh treatment of Germany after defeat.",16
775,"Lloyd George discovered in 1919, as Law had done in 1914, that a Unionist party that had given its total commitment to a cause would not be fobbed off with a compromise.",16
776,"In the years before 1914 the iron of partisan politics bad entered into the Tory soul, and in the battle for Ulster every weapon had been deemed acceptable.",16
777,"After 1914 there was the same certainty about the war, and it was indeed the inflexible determination of the Unionist party, sure about ends and pragmatic means, that was the bedrock on which Britain's war effort rested.",16
778,"Opposition to Home Rule had been canalized into a patriotic war and so the party ended the war in a confident mood, as it had begun it.",16
779,"In the shared community of sacrifice the party had undoubtedly widened its community of interest with the British people, and was able to speak for all of the people in 1917–18 as it had spoken for only an embattled half in 1913.",16
780,"The party therefore reaped the benefit of its national identity in the election of 1918, capturing the mood of the moment as surely as Lloyd George did.",16
781,"In the strident campaign of December 1918 the Unionists were in their element, sure of what must be done as no other party was sure.",16
782,"In its external elements then, the war widened the Unionists""confidence and appeal created it, lining up the nation with the party the reverse.",16
783,"In its domestic aspects though, things had gone very differently: Unionist fears about the growth of Labour extremism had been widespread before the war and had stemmed from two different factors.",16
784,There had been good reason to know that Labour could damage Unionist electoral prospects and the dangerous prospect of a class-based party system had been present in the Liberal-Labour alliance.,16
785,"Underlying this had been a deeper fear of more extreme socialists, especially the syndicalists, who might threaten violence and revolution.",16
786,The War threatened to sweep away such fears in the uninhibited jingoism that greeted the outbreak of hostilities.,16
787,"The train was  ""on different rails"" and Unionists could not fail to rejoice at the disarray on the left, but the different rails might prove more suitable for Trotsky's ""locomotive of History"" than for Unionist imperialism.",16
788,"By 1917 Unionists had more cause to fear than to rejoice, for the Labour movement had been greatly strengthened by the war in both its aspects; increasing membership and growing militancy in the trades unions, growing confidence in the Labour party, the arrival of organized revolutionary extremism in the shop-stewards""movement all pointed to a grim future.",16
789,"The troubles in Sheffield and South Wales, the example of ""Red Clydeside"" and the inspiration of revolutionary Russia might all be signs of a new and terrible future.",16
790,"Unionist fears were based overwhelmingly on ignorance, in isolation from working-class attitudes at home and in the trenches, and on the certainty that things could not be the same again.",16
791,"By 1918 these fears had reached fever pitch; one Conservative MP recalled that his family had expected that the end of the war would be followed by atrocities like those in Russia, that ""families like ours would be strung up from the nearest lamp post"" ; Robert Sanders was surprised to see on Armistice Day that the crowds were actually cheering the King, so unlike the fate of the Russian royal family a few months earlier.",16
792,"Such fears were vastly exaggerated, for if Britain ever did reach a stage of possible revolution, then it was certainly after during the war, but in isolation from working-class opinions, they seemed real enough to Unionist MPs and their supporters in 1918.",16
793,"Unionist reactions were twofold, first to play up the war itself as a unifier of classes, and second to exploit divisions in the Labour movement in the hope of carrying them over into peacetime.",16
794,"The party's first object was the prosecution of the war, and this could be linked convincingly enough with attacks on malingerers and deserters; long after 1902 Unionists had continued to revile radical Liberals (including Lloyd George) as pro-Boers, and this view was easily adaptable to the Labour party in the new war.",16
795,"The campaign for conscription was intended to force opponents of the war out into the open, their lack of patriotism could be exposed when it would be unpopular.",16
796,"When conscription came into force, Unionists pressed for the disfranchisement of conscientious objectors, more because it would be a sign of civic excommunication than because their numbers were significant.",16
797,The reverse of this policy was a Unionist proposal that all men in the armed  forces should qualify for the franchise right.,16
798,"A clear division was to be made then, with all who served their country being enfranchised and all who refused being disfranchised, in both cases age or other considerations; the war was to be the test and the policy was to be ""What did you do in the war, Daddy?"" ",16
799,"Neither policy was implemented, although gestures were made in each direction.",16
800,"As President of the Local Government Board, Walter Long surprised opponents and supporters alike by the fairness with which he treated conscientious objectors, but local Unionists on the appeals tribunals were far less tolerant.",16
801,"The franchise was eventually widened as a result of the Unionist demand, but not as they had expected.",16
802,Unionists did though make war service a main plank of their electioneering whenever they had the chance.,16
803,"In 1918 Sanders noted that""I had a contest with Plummer, the Bridgwater Trades Union Secretary.",16
804,His supporters said he had got wages raised and would get the agricultural labourer 40/ a week.,16
805,"My supporters said ""Sanders went to fight and Plummer did not."" ",16
806,"On such issues are the fates of Empire divided.""",16
807,"After the war, Unionist candidates with commissions, good war records and decorations made the most of their advantages, especially when they could be set against opponents who had opposed the war or stayed at home.",16
808,Ramsay MacDonald was beaten by such a campaign in 1921 with language that made the general election of 1918 seem tame.,16
809,"As late as 1931, the war records of Labour candidates were still held against them, although by then Ramsay MacDonald, like Lloyd George before him, had been forgiven his sins.",16
810,"Exploitation of divisions in the Labour movement was the concern of only a small number of Unionists, linked mainly with Lord Milner and with Central Office.",16
811,The British Workers' League was founded under Milner's wing as a front organization that was linked in principle with the coalition as a whole but was run from the Unionist side.,16
812,"Its leader was Victor Fisher and it was dedicated to providing a point around which ""patriotic labour"" could rally.",16
813,It asserted the need for social reform within a broad imperial policy and attacked the official leaders of the Labour movement for their failure to dissociate themselves from pacifists and militants.,16
814,"In the Labour movement it never made much impact, for it always remained an alien force, financed and directed from outside, but it achieved something in taking the battle the streets to break up the meetings of the left.",16
815,"Even here more was achieved by the ""patriotic labour"" men who had originated in the Labour movement and stayed in it, Jack Jones in West Ham.",16
816,"Central Office had great difficulty finding seats for the candidates of the National Democratic Party (NDP), as the BWL had become by 1918, and it took some time even to find a place for Victor Fisher himself before he was finally installed for Stourbridge.",16
817,"Unionists did not wish to stand down where they had a candidate of their own ready to fight; in these circumstances, the NDP did remarkably well in 1918, winning eleven seats, all in Labour strongholds where neither Unionists nor Coalition Liberals had much desire to stand, and  they beat both MacDonald and Henderson.",16
818,"After the election, though, the NDP faded into the ranks of the coalition majority, having neither roots nor party organization of their own, and Unionist efforts were carried on instead through a Labour wing in their own party.",16
819,"The Labour vote was badly hit by the NDP even in working-class strongholds, but no impression was made on the Labour movement.",16
820,The general question of Unionist attitudes to Labour was highlighted at the Special Party Conference in 1917 where Law came under a strong attack.,16
821,"He gave his followers an analysis of the situation straight from the shoulder, with no false optimism about the immediate prospects and considerable perception about future events:",16
822,"There is another thing which I know you were thinking about a great deal, which all of us must think about.",16
823,", the future of our Party after the War is over.",16
824,"You would like, I daresay, if I could give you a clear and definite policy.",16
825,"Well, I cannot.",16
826,We are looking into a fog.,16
827,"It is absolutely futile to try to make plans for conditions which you cannot foresee,(Hear, hear).",16
828,But this I would say to you.,16
829,"I am not sure that you will agree with me, but I have no doubt about it; our Parry on the old lines will have no future in the life of this Country (Hear, hear).",16
830,What is the future likely to be?,16
831,"It is all guesswork, but we cannot help thinking about it, and I have thought about it.",16
832,There seems to be two possible ways in which our Party can keep its old force.,16
833,One would be if- I will not say the Labour Party but the extreme Labour Party — were to get so powerful that it would be a menace and we should have thrown on the other scale all that was moderate in the Liberal Party our own Party.,16
834,"That is not going to happen in my judgement without some leader who commands the support of a large section of the country, and I do not see where that leader is going to come from.",16
835,But the other way in which our Party has a future is the way in which I would like to see it have a future.,16
836,"In the past we have suffered tremendously, because we have always had the whole of organised Labour against us.",16
837,It is that that defeated our Tariff Reform proposal — that and that alone.,16
838,"Well, gentlemen, there is splitting in all parties, and when you feel that our Party is suffering , look at the others and ask which of them is worse?",16
839,"There is splitting in all parties, and nowhere is it more marked than in the Labour Party (Hear, hear).",16
840,"Now, gentlemen, this war has shown that among the leaders of Labour there is a body which is national and patriotic (Hear, hear and applause,) and feels these sentiments as strongly as we do.",16
841,"I feel it is our duty to try to get — I will not say on our side but to work with us — the section of Labour which is national and imperialistic (Applause) We have got to get on our side if we can, the section of Labour which recognises that for all classes, employers and employed, production is the one thing to be aimed at (Applause), and that anything which is detrimental to that is detrimental to anybody.",16
842,"Well, gentlemen, you have cheered this.",16
843,"Everybody in our Party welcomes that with their lips, but I will tell you what I think about it, and I am going to speak quite frankly.",16
844,There are a great many who imagine that we can get Labour to take the shilling for us and to fight simply for our old aims as an adjunct to our Party.,16
845,"That is not going to happen (Hear, hear).",16
846,If we are going to become part of that larger Party we will have to pay the price.,16
847,I am not going to attempt today to foresee what that price will be.,16
848,It may be that it is a price which none of us will  pay.,16
849,It may be that when the time comes our Party will be divided this matter.,16
850,"But, gentlemen, of this I am certain, the Conservative Party has been a good thing for this country and it is our business today, and we can, to keep that Party solid; and if splits must come, to delay them we possibly can (Applause).",16
851,"In this single speech, Law foreshadowed the development of the party for the next fifteen years; the strategic dilemma over relations with the other parties after the war, the need to make real concessions to make a coalition workable, the openings that could be created by a national leader of independent reputation (Baldwin as it turned out), and the outcome when the moderate men of all parties came together in 1931.",16
852,"At the same conference, Law warned the Unionists that they must accept the government's plans to extend the franchise, whatever their personal opinions:",16
853,It is very difficult to see…how you could stop much short of the Bill which is now before the House of Commons.,16
854,"And, gentlemen, I should like to say this also; our Party if it is properly conducted has no reason to fear that the mass of the people in this country will not support it (Hear, hear).",16
855,"If we cannot win that support, we may go business, and it is our duty now at all events to make the best of the situation which has arisen and to see that everything is done to make our Party what Disraeli called it — and what, if it is to have any existence, It must be — a really national party.",16
856,"It is ironical that one of the most beneficial developments of the war years, the Representation of the People Act of 1918, should have occasioned so much party opposition.",16
857,"Consideration of the franchise bad followed Unionist demands for votes for servicemen, and a Speaker's Conference was set up in 1916, with the Unionist members led by Sir William Bull and Sir Harry Samuel.",16
858,"It seems that a deal was hatched behind the closed doors of the Conference, by which Unionists accepted a widening of the franchise to include all men and some women, a Liberal agreement to accept some plural votes and a complete redistribution of seats.",16
859,"Liberals had argued for a wider franchise for years and Unionists had demanded a redistribution, so both sides got something of what they wanted and proportional representation was thrown in with the present mood of Labour in mind, the anti-socialist parties would be able to consolidate their position if necessary.",16
860,"Unionist reactions to these proposals, published and embodied in the Representation of the People Bill early in 1917, were very hostile indeed; it seemed a reckless step to give the biggest ever increase in the franchise in the midst of a major war, to throw away some of the plural votes on which the party had relied, and to receive in return a redistribution that could bring almost anything.",16
861,A bitter debate in the Executive of the National Union on 8 February 1917 resulted in the setting up of a special sub-committee to consider the Bill; a suggestion that MPs should be ineligible for the sub-committee  because they had let down the party so badly in the Speaker's Conference was only narrowly lost.,16
862,"At the next meeting, the proposals were considered one by one, the views of the sub-committee; every proposal was criticized and a highly critical sub-committee report was adopted , with Sir Harry Samuel finally abstaining after failing to convince his colleagues of the rightness of the proposals.",16
863,"The party view, express d well by the Conservative Agents""journal, was that the Unionists in the Speaker's Conference had been taken in by the Liberal members, that they had not sought or received any professional advice, and that they had blundered accordingly.",16
864,"However, the Central Council recognized in April that a franchise change could not now be avoided, but resolved to support it only if the government would agree to restore the House of Lords at the same time.",16
865,"Reports from the constituencies in May showed 259 local parties against the Bill and only thirty-two in favour; eighty-three suggested no change in wartime; twice as many local parties supported votes for women as opposed the idea, by ninety-eight to forty-four, and there was little or no support for proportional representation.",16
866,"By May the principle of change had been accepted as inevitable, an extension of the franchise had been proposed, it would be suicidal for the party to oppose it, and there was thus a need to concentrate on pressing detailed amendments, to protect the interests and representation of agriculture.",16
867,"But the partisan warfare went on: Walter Long and his PPS, Sir William Bull (who had been on the Conference himself), reacted angrily to complaints from the agents and suggested that the professional organizers wanted to keep the system as complicated as possible they could keep their pay and privileges.",16
868,The agents took this as a slander on their profession and replied in kind.,16
869,"Bull also continued the fight with greater subtlety through the Daily Telegraph: he wrote for the Telegraph regularly in 1917, either directly as ""our political correspondent"" , or indirectly by feeding information on the Bill to the paper, and this helped to keep one part of the Unionist press briefed with the official party line.",16
870,"It was increasingly difficult to see what the party line was: the Chief Whip, Lord Edmund Talbot, had summoned Robert Sanders back from war service and after his return in May 1917 he was pressed into the party's service.",16
871,"Sanders had been a Whip and a specialist in franchise matters before the war, so his return to Westminster gave an added impetus to the party campaign against the Bill; he became a sort of unofficial party Whip against a government that the party supported, cooperated closely with George Younger, by this time Party Chairman, and eventually became deputy chairman of the party himself in 1918.",16
872,"The battle now shifted to parliament, where the second reading was carried by a huge majority on 22 May; many Unionists spoke against the Bill, but few could bring themselves to oppose it in principle, and so Sanders could mobilize only forty MPs to go with him into the No lobby.",16
873,But this signalized  the beginning of the open fight.,16
874,In June the National Union finally decided its attitude: it was duly recorded that:,16
875,the Unionist party…has always been :,16
876,1.,16
877,An extension of the franchise.,16
878,2. [votes for servicemen],16
879,3.,16
880,Simplification of Registration.,16
881,4.,16
882,An Equitable scheme of Redistribution.,16
883,5.,16
884,All of these proposals to be applicable to the whole of the U.K.,16
885,6.,16
886,"Concurrently, a scheme for the reconstitution of the Second Chamber with adequate powers to be introduced.",16
887,"It will thus be seen that the Party is Electoral Reform being dealt with on a sound basis, but at the proper time.",16
888,Since reform was now unavoidable it must be made certain that Ireland would be included under the redistribution clauses and that the House of Lords should be restored to entrench resistance to Labour.,16
889,"The details of amendments to the Bill needed to press these points were sent to each Unionist MP, from Central Office not from the official Whips, and a special committee of agents and National Union leaders was set up to give MPs professional advice.",16
890,"By mid July Unionists in the Commons had tabled and spoken to over 160 amendments, with the heaviest burden falling on Younger and Sanders.",16
891,"Pressure was such that the government, in the person of George Cave the Unionist Home Secretary, was frequently forced to allow free votes, so several useful amendments were carried.",16
892,"Instructions to the boundary commissioners were revoked and amended they would be able to consider economic interest population and community in the drawing up of the new constituencies; this was regarded as vital by the Unionists, for it seemed likely that the merging of the small boroughs into the county constituencies would take away the last of the agricultural seats.",16
893,"Similarly, an amendment carried in November 1917 did much to nullify the reduction of plural voting rights for town dwellers.",16
894,"Before 1918 electors could have one vote, they could quality in different towns or counties; it was now proposed by Unionists that the qualifying area in boroughs should become the constituency the borough itself.",16
895,"A shopkeeper with a shop in Bristol Central and a home in Bristol West would now qualify for a vote in both constituencies; under the new system, there were few ways to qualify for plural votes, but it was much easier actually to qualify, and so tens of thousands of new plural votes were created, overwhelmingly Unionist.",16
896,At the end of 1917 there was much parliamentary manoeuvring over proportional representation.,16
897,"The original proposal had been for PR in the cities but this was opposed by Unionists who were concerned to protect the efficacy of the business vote; Central Office also opposed the alternative vote when it was put forward in the debates, and the majority of Unionist MPs and the National Union never backed either system.",16
898,The Commons could not  agree on a scheme and several were inserted in the Bill by a temporary majority of one day and then removed by another majority later.,16
899,"The Lords entered the fray in December with a strong preference for PR as a means of keeping both the Labour party and the Commons in check, in January 1918 there were disputes between the two houses between and within the parties.",16
900,"The outcome, perhaps inevitably, was that no new voting system was introduced, the university constituencies (for it was deemed that graduates would be able to follow the mysteries of PR the rest of the electors could not).",16
901,"The Representation of the People Act thus became law in February 1918, ushering in an era of near democracy, increasing the electorate from the 7.7 million of 1910 to 21.4 million in 1918, over three-quarters of whom had never voted before.",16
902,"The Act of 1918 set the scene of the entire political world between the wars, often through consequences that were not seen for a generation.",16
903,"Unionists proved quite able to handle the new mass electorate, and their efforts to gear up to meet new challenges in and after 1911 had set them on the right road.",16
904,"The party took more easily to modern electioneering than did the Liberals, and gained an unexpected bonus in the votes of women, who have been a force for conservatism since their enfranchisement in 1918.",16
905,"What could be anticipated with confidence was the beneficial results of redistribution, for Unionists had expected them for some time.",16
906,"Before the war, Unionists had pointed to the huge disparity between the smallest and largest seats (in 1910 Kilkenny had an electorate of a few hundred and Romford an electorate of over 50,000), and had noted that Unionist constituencies were on average larger than Liberal constituencies, far larger than those of Nationalists in Ireland.",16
907,"""Increasing population in England and migration of middle-class voters from the towns to the suburbs had led to these disparities and to a situation where any redistribution would help Unionism.",16
908,In 1911–12 Major Morrison-Bell MP constructed a model to demonstrate these disparities of distribution and had toured the country with it for propaganda purposes; the obvious over-representation of Ireland was especially useful to a Unionist party that wished to claim that Redmond was holding the Empire to ransom.,16
909,"The changes in population in the decade 1901–10, revealed in the 1911 census, demonstrated the rapid increase of population in Unionist areas and the static position in Liberal and Nationalist areas.",16
910,"The LCC area had declined in population by 0.2 overall, but within that Lewisham had increased by 26 and Wandsworth by 34 ; the population of Middlesex was up by 42 in ten years, Essex and Surrey both by 30 , while the population of Ireland had fallen by another 2 .",16
911,Time was clearly on the Unionist side.,16
912,"In the event, the actual redistribution of 1918 came as something of a disappointment, for although there was redistribution within Ireland, the overall number of Irish seats remained the same, and there was only a small increase in the number of English seats.",16
913,"But there was a net gain of some  thirty seats to the Unionists in direct comparison with the last elections in 1910, a strong position for a party that was already the largest in parliament.",16
914,"This position was further improved by the effective withdrawal of from Westminster after the election of 1918 and the second redistribution in Ireland in 1921 after the Government of Ireland Act, which gave another bonus""to the Unionists by removing about seventy opponents from the House of Commons.",16
915,"The net effect of the Acts of 1918 and 1921 was thus to improve the Unionist position by a hundred seats, not just in that parliament but in every succeeding one too.",16
916,"In other words, quite the franchise changes that did the party no net harm, the changes of 1918–21 transformed the Unionists from the natural minority that they had been in 1914 to a natural majority party until the Second World War.",16
917,"Under the electoral system of 1918, the Unionists had a minimum vote of 38 of the electorate, and this would bring 250 seats in a parliament of 615; in a political world of three parties this almost guaranteed that no other party would govern alone and that the Unionists would usually have a majority.",16
918,"Within this there was an equally important change, for not only did the number of Unionist seats increase, but so did the number of safe seats.",16
919,"Neal Blewett found just forty-eight ""predominantly middle-class"" constituencies in 1910, while Michael Kinnear found seventy-five in 1921 (and Kinnear's figure is certainly an understatement, for he could not get figures for divided boroughs outside London, many of which certainly would come into his category, so the real figure may be more like ninety).",16
920,"The already safe seat at Wandsworth was divided in 1918 into five safe seats; Lewisham, Hammersmith and Fulham were each divided into two seats; the number of seats in the outer London suburbs of Kent, Surrey, Essex and Middlesex went up from fifteen to forty, of which thirty-five were held by Unionists at every election before 1945.",16
921,The value of such an expansion of political suburbia has been demonstrated by Michael Kinnear.,16
922,"There were 200 seats with a substantial middle-class element, and these were overwhelmingly Unionist at each election between the wars.",16
923,"If the agricultural seats are added to the middle-class strongholds, it can be seen why Conservatism was so strong between the wars, for the party could count well over 200 seats as unshakably safe and on 300 as reliable enough to be won except in a very bad year.",16
924,"At a time when many middle-class voters would be looking for the party that would best defend them from Labour, this Conservative strength would be of vital importance.",16
925,"The Conservatives would not always win under the electoral system of 1918, but they would rarely do so badly as to allow anyone else to win.",16
926,"The revival of activity occasioned by the 1918 Act and its redistribution may have helped to revive local Unionist parties, but in fact the war had a less serious effect than might be expected.",16
927,"In the first months, when hostilities were expected to last for only a few months, party activity was hardly affected .",16
928,A registration campaign was conducted in the autumn of 1914  and Central Office encouraged the continuation of normal activities.,16
929,"Continuation of the war in 1915, together with the absence of key figures at every level, led to a suspension of all but routine party business.",16
930,"The typical pattern was for the local parties to meet only once a year in 1915 and 1916, to re-elect their officers for another year; agents who had enlisted were kept on the books by retaining half their normal pay, to compensate them for loss of earnings in the national interest and to keep them available for a resumption of partisanship.",16
931,"Central Office tried to keep the local parties alive, for the party truce was only renewed for a few months at a time and parliament was prolonged beyond its five-year term only for a few months at a time too.",16
932,"Subscriptions fell steadily and expenditure fell even more sharply with the reduction of salaries and the suspension of propaganda, most local parties ended the war with a substantial profit; but this concealed a real weakness, for expenditure could be revived by a single decision, while income could only be revived by many years of patient work.",16
933,"In 1917 the state of readiness slipped further, with most local parties holding no meeting , some sacking their agents, and closing their offices.",16
934,"The agents who remained operated a skeleton service for several constituencies, with the salary shared out too; they visited each office once a week to answer letters and transact routine business; the Annual Report for the Yorkshire Area for 1916–17 claimed ""we still say no offices entirely closed"" but this was a realistic picture of party activity.",16
935,"Things had got even worse on the voluntary side, for without subscriptions to collect or canvassing to do, the whole basis of the voluntary party had gone.",16
936,"The Yorkshire Annual Report for 1920 recalled that ""November 1918 found all Party organizations the worse — not for War but for inactivity"" .",16
937,"The party structure was probably saved by two features, the recruiting of 1915–16 and the need to cope with the Representation of the People Act in 1918.",16
938,"The Parliamentary Recruiting Committee ran the national campaign for recruits in the first eighteen months of the war, through party national channels.",16
939,"The Committee was convened by the Chief Whips of the parties, and the chief professional organizers became joint secretaries.",16
940,"Boraston was thus directly involved in administration, and Central Office looked after the organization of recruiting meetings; the Liberal offices dealt with literature for recruitment and Malcolm Fraser was transferred to Abingdon Street to help with the management of the press.",16
941,"The entire effort was run like a political campaign, with the canvassers, speakers, stewards and publicity all run on tried and familiar lines.",16
942,"District and constituency offices were similarly involved and in many areas the national example was followed, with the agents of both parties working under a mayor or lord lieutenant.",16
943,The Derby Scheme of 1915 allowed the local parties to mount a full-scale exercise in canvassing and knocking-up.,16
944,"When the state took over recruitment under the Military Service Acts, the party continued to be involved: many agents were transferred to the army, where they continued to  do the same job, and many party offices were lent to the government as recruitment centres.",16
945,In 1917 party organization was used for the War Savings and War Aims movements.,16
946,"This all reflects the important part that political organizations played in the Edwardian era, for when politicians needed means of communication and organization in a time of crisis it was to the parties to the state that they turned for the machinery and the expertise; it was not to be the same in 1939, with consequent effects on the state of the local parties by 1945.",16
947,Through recruiting and War Aims publicity.,16
948,even tapers and tadpoles could play their part in the national cause.,16
949,"Central Office was able to keep going at full capacity through 1915 and 1916, but here again there was a falling off in 1917.",16
950,Boraston was so much involved in war work that his assistant.,16
951,William Jenkins.,16
952,had to be promoted to Joint Principal Agent to look after the party.,16
953,and he was also given a promise of the reversion of Boraston's job.,16
954,"By this time too there were economies in staff and publications the war: Gleanings and Memoranda, the Constitutional Year Book and other semi-partisan pieces of literature were suspended in 1917 for the duration.",16
955,"The middle of 1917 saw the party at its lowest ebb, but the demands of an approaching general election produced a recovery.",16
956,Professional advice was important to the MPs fighting the Representation of the People Bill and National Union committees began to meet again at every level to discuss the Bill's consequences for the party.,16
957,"There was a conference in late 1917, the Executive met regularly.",16
958,and the Central Council met a record four times in 1917.,16
959,The rules of the national Union were changed to allow a special appeal to working-class and women voters.,16
960,Constituency parties had to be wound up and re-formed to conform to the new boundaries.,16
961,and all this at the worst point of the war.,16
962,Local campaigns to resist unsatisfactory new boundaries were run and in some cases were very successful.,16
963,"In Cheshire the plans put forward by the boundary commissioners were opposed by local Unionists and counter-proposals put forward by their chairman, Sir Alan Sykes.",16
964,were adopted instead: this produced a new constituency called Eddisbury. which would be a most peculiar shape.,16
965,but which would be almost wholly agricultural — and strongly Unionist.,16
966,Finally.,16
967,the passage of the Act into law made a general election a certainty in the near future.,16
968,"For the local parties this increased the urgency of changing the local structures and settling candidates; for Central Office it meant the negotiation of a pact with the Coalition Liberals and the NDP, the arrangements of a joint platform.",16
969,and the production of anti-Labour party literature.,16
970,all of which were under discussion from the spring of 1918.,16
971,"In every way, then, the party organization emerged from the war years in reasonably good shape; it had played its part in the war and its local and national structures were attenuated but intact (a major and significant contrast with the effect of war on the Liberals).",16
972,and a large reform had been carried out with little trouble.,16
973,"Great efforts would be needed to restore the party to its strong position of 1914 and to carry on with  the fundamental changes that had been then, but the war years had done no lasting damage.",16
974,"The final effect of the First World War was less tangible, the impact of war on the attitudes of Unionists themselves, but there is no doubt that the holocaust did leave lasting effects.",16
975,The effect of war on religion was among the most profound of these influences.,16
976,"For the party that had leaned heavily on the established Church and derived satisfaction from its role as defender of the Church, the decline of religion was a serious blow.",16
977,"After the war clouds rolled away old arguments about Home Rule were quickly resumed, but the issue of the Welsh Church was easily settled: Lloyd George offered compensation and the Welsh Church was duly disestablished in 1920 with little Unionist complaint.",16
978,"The House of Lords, trade unions, and licensing continued to raise as much heat as before in Unionist minds, but the issue of the Church was drowned in the mud of Flanders.",16
979,"Fisher's Education Act of 1918 raised far less sectarian strife than Balfour's had done in 1902, less even than Butler's was to do in 1944.",16
980,"the death of the old politics of Church and Chapel was a consequence of the catastrophic effect of the war on militant Nonconformity, and especially on Nonconformist Liberalism, but it was also a new doubt on the Unionist side.",16
981,"The Prayer Book debates of 1928 and the arguments over tithes in the 1930s showed that many Unionists still counted the interests of the Church high in their priorities, but the battles were party ones.",16
982,"The party was as sure as ever about Christian principles, and the advent of women into the organization may even have strengthened the connection, but there was certainty about forms and institutions.",16
983,"Baldwin was one party man who remained a convinced Christian but without certainty about forms, and he was also characteristic of one sort of party response to the suffering caused by the war itself.",16
984,"Bonar Law became ever more pessimistic after the death of his sons in action in 1917, but the reaction of Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain was more positive.",16
985,"To both of them, the human sacrifice of 1914–18 created not just a deep loathing of war but also a determination that such sacrifice should not be .",16
986,Baldwin had a profound distaste for those who had made money the war and in 1919 he made an anonymous donation of part of his wealth to the nation as his personal sacrifice; Neville Chamberlain was greatly affected by the death of his cousin Norman and determined that such sacrifice should not be wasted.,16
987,"For many there was a conviction that the post-war world must be made a better place, a view that recurred regularly over the next twenty years.",16
988,"In 1925 Winston Churchill, no empty idealist, introduced his pension scheme with the hope",16
989,"that the sufferings, the sacrifices, the sorrow of the war have sown a seed from which a strong tree will grow.",16
990,"This is the finest war memorial you could set the men who gave their lives, their limbs, or their health, and those who lost their dear ones in the country's cause.",16
991,"For the older men, who had sent their sons to slaughter, there remained a determination to make conditions better; for the younger men there was an almost obsessive guilt at having survived the holocaust when so many friends had died.",16
992,In their different ways.,16
993,"Harold Macmillan and Anthony Eden shared the same reaction; the young Robert Boothby was one of the few who were disappointed by the Armistice, because he had been too young to fight.",16
994,Not everyone was affected by the war in this way.,16
995,but a large group in the party were scarred by the First World War for the rest of their lives.,16
996,and as a result the party acquired a moral calibre that it had not had before.,16
997,"The Unionist party thus emerged from the war reassured in its identity as the national party, more closely the national mood than in 1914, with its electoral prospects much improved.",16
998,"but, like the rest of the nation, affected deeply by the war.",16
999,"The only cloud, and in 1918 a threatening thunderstorm to all appearances.",16
1000,was the challenge from Labour.,16
1001,The struggle to determine the party's attitude to the aspirations of Labour was to be its chief battleground for the next six years.,16
1002,"Coalition troubles, 1915–1921",16
1003,For ten years after 1914 the theme of party was accompanied by a strong counterpoint: the idea of coalition.,16
1004,"For Rosebery, for Milner, even for Lloyd George, there had been temptation in coalition ever since the Boer War, but such dreams had never come into the political daylight.",16
1005,But when war came the persistent pedal-point of coalitionism sounded all the louder for the sudden silence of the party truce.,16
1006,"A coalition government was formed in May 1915, continued under Lloyd George in December 1916, and carried over into peacetime in 1918.",16
1007,"Once established, coalition proved difficult to shift and coalitionists developed an ideology of their own.",16
1008,"During Lloyd George's premiership, the counterpoint of coalition almost drowned the theme of party, and many Unionists feared for the survival of politics as they knew it.",16
1009,"The coalition facilitated a realignment from the two-party Liberal-Unionist contest in 1914 to the Labour-Conservative battles of the late 1920s; only with the triumph of coalition in 1916 did the old politics die, and only with the destruction of coalitionism in 1924 could the new politics be born.",16
1010,It is necessary to examine the idea of coalitionism and the political forces that made it a powerful alternative before considering its direct impact on the Unionist party.,16
1011,"The most positive argument for coalition, and the one that tipped the balance in its favour, was the experience of war.",16
1012,"The Boer War brought the first murmurs of coalitionism, a sense of national crisis brought the first attempt to form a coalition, and the advent of the First World War made it a practical possibility.",16
1013,"In each case the argument was much the same: in crisis, it was the duty of politicians to come together the best men could be used to the greatest advantage, and so that shibboleths of party could be discarded.",16
1014,"Without a combination the nation could not be properly mobilized, for any party government would be opposed by half the nation, and would be forced to consider its own extremists as more important than moderates on the other side.",16
1015,"Coalition was the negation of the party system, for as party assumed a grouping from the centre to one of the extremes, coalition assumed a grouping at the centre to the exclusion of extremists.",16
1016,"A coalition in 1910 would have excluded Ulster, Irish Nationalists, and Labour; coalition in 1915 excluded anti-war MPs and diehards.",16
1017,"The very existence of coalition meant a struggle for the survival of party, a struggle that the Liberals lost, that Labour  won by keeping clear, and that Unionism almost lost too.",16
1018,"By May 1915 Unionist leaders were convinced that they must give up some independence if they were to influence the war; the liquor issue seemed to show the danger of staying aloof, and the shell scandal seemed to show that they were needed inside.",16
1019,"National and party interest thus combined to make Sonar Law promote a coalition, but it was the national interest that was cited as the reason for joining Asquith.",16
1020,"It was also the national cause that prompted Law to accept a junior position; he took the Colonial Office himself, a backwater in wartime, and Liberals retained most of the major posts.",16
1021,"In a negative way, Unionists had an important influence on the new government.",16
1022,"securing the removal of Haldane, the demotion of Churchill and the placing of munitions under Lloyd George.",16
1023,"Unionist ministers were also able to move the Liberal majority closer to the Unionist view of how the war should be run, notably on conscription and compulsion.",16
1024,"Asquith's 1915 government was only halfway to coalition; it was in fact a coalition of parties a coalition of men, and it was run to maximize continuity.",16
1025,Unionists were therefore soon frustrated by what seemed the weakness of their leaders in swallowing- Asquith and getting nothing in return.,16
1026,In parliament the position seemed worse the Unionist leaders sat on the government front bench while their followers continued to sit as the opposition.,16
1027,But it was the continuing failure in the war and Asquith's inability to take important decisions in time that really fuelled Unionist discontent in 1916.,16
1028,By the summer of 1916 the Unionist backbenchers were used to voting against the government.,16
1029,and were close to acting as a full opposition again under Carson.,16
1030,"In the crucial Nigeria debate in November Law actually did quite well, for he persuaded a narrow majority of Unionists to back the government.",16
1031,"At the height of the criticism, Law met constituency chairmen and agents at the Queen's Hall and told them that",16
1032,the question this government was wise must be judged on very broad grounds.,16
1033,"This is the question which everyone ought to ask himself, and the only question — are we as a nation in a better position to prosecute the war as a consequence of it than we would have been by any other arrangement?",16
1034,I have no doubt of it.,16
1035,"A year later he recalled that he had supported Asquith because""rightly or wrongly.",16
1036,"I was afraid of any alternative at the time"".",16
1037,"In 1916 he cited conscription and the suspension of trades union restrictions as things that coalition had done for the nation; Gleanings and Memoranda headlined the speech ""The Coalition Form of Government almost indispensable."" ",16
1038,The argument for coalition was pragmatic.,16
1039,"that no other government was fitted to the war effort, but it had significant undertones: coalition was especially useful in providing the party with allies more able to secure the cooperation of the working class.",16
1040,"Although the Nigeria debate was a relative success after a year of criticism, its significance was not lost on Law: it was held on the subject central to  Unionist economic attitudes; Law and Steel-Maitland were singled out for censure, a pointer to the level of party discontent Party feeling had built up much as Law's own had done; having fought off the direct attack, he took the party him in the effort to reconstruct the government on more businesslike lines.",16
1041,"There is no question of Carson, Law and Lloyd George conducting a conspiracy to unseat Asquith in December 1916; Law and Lloyd George wished to retain Asquith in government and they kept him informed about their plans.",16
1042,"Asquith's fall was the result of his own miscalculation, especially of his reluctance to believe that the Unionists would prefer Lloyd George to himself in a contest.",16
1043,"When the real crisis broke the Unionist ministers acted to strengthen Lloyd George's hand, from a conviction that only greater power for Lloyd George could put enough drive into the war effort.",16
1044,"Unanimity was less marked in the scramble for office after Asquith's departure; ""the three Cs"" , Curzon, Chamberlain and Cecil, managed to keep official party interests to the fore by ensuring that Curzon Carson should join the war cabinet — disloyalty might be useful but it should not be seen to pay.",16
1045,"For the rest of the war, the party's loyalty to Lloyd George was strengthened when he became not only the organizer of victory but the inspiration of the country.",16
1046,National service remained the prime reason for coalition.,16
1047,"With the approaching end of war in 1918 coalition became more positive because the coalition now had to deal with the issues that had been put aside for the duration, and more controversial because this pushed some Unionists into outright opposition.",16
1048,"The government had prepared ambitious reconstruction plans, partly devised to put a moral basis into the war effort and partly produced by progressive ministers and their advisers.",16
1049,"It could now be argued that the unity of wartime should be carried on to deal with peacemaking, demobilization and economic reconstruction.",16
1050,The government that had won the war would smooth the transition to peace and would redeem its promise of a land fit for heroes.,16
1051,"Such was the argument adopted by most Unionist candidates in the 1918 election, a positive programme of the sort put forward by Lloyd George in 1910.",16
1052,"A deal on the government's actual policies was done, again like that proposed in 1910, the Unionists now held rather more of the cards.",16
1053,"The basis of the argument was still the national interest, but the emphasis was now on positive domestic possibilities on negative foreign problems.",16
1054,Underlying the Unionist acceptance of coalition in 1918 was a darker attitude to the future than appeared in the coalition programme.,16
1055,"It was important to retain Lloyd George, not just as the man who had won the war but also as a man who could talk to the working class; and if a revolutionary situation were to arise, then it would be far better if Unionists could call on Liberals to help resist it.",16
1056,"The post-war coalition thus had two distinct justifications, a positive sense of what could be done and a negative dread of the alternative.",16
1057,In 1920 Birkenhead put forward both lines of argument when  he argued for greater coalition cooperation in the press.,16
1058,Gradually.,16
1059,though.,16
1060,the failure of coalition policies.,16
1061,failure to deliver the goods in almost every sphere.,16
1062,reduced the positive side of the argument to nothing.,16
1063,"By 1922 coalition was based on fear, though by that time on fear of parliamentary Labour revolution as such.",16
1064,It was still possible to argue.,16
1065,"as Younger did in January 1922, that a coalition could best carry through the policies that Unionists wanted, but by then the main Unionist demands were directed against Labour anyway.",16
1066,the reform of trade union law and restoration of the House of Lords.,16
1067,"By the autumn, the arguments for coalition were entirely negative.",16
1068,"Coalitionism, though.",16
1069,was a matter of men measures.,16
1070,The change to a real coalition in 1916 had been occasioned by the need to give Lloyd George a freer hand as much as by concern for structures.,16
1071,The government then developed a momentum of its own as a focus of loyalty that ran against the party system.,16
1072,There had always been more between the front benches than either had their followers in the country.,16
1073,By 1920 several Unionists actually thought of themselves as coalitionists.,16
1074,Austen Chamberlain made no secret of his belief that coalition produced better government than party.,16
1075,and he reached a stage of heavy dependence on Lloyd George; Birkenhead found it more congenial to work with men of ideas like Churchill than with the squires who would fill out a Unionist ministry; Balfour had always striven to practise government by agreement.,16
1076,"and Curzon was attracted by the glamour of the ""first eleven"" .",16
1077,By 1922 the team of brilliant men who had governed for the past six years could not but see themselves as irreplaceable.,16
1078,They could not easily accept a return to old party cries or the need to oppose men who had become close friends.,16
1079,"Nor were such responses confined to the cabinet, for many Unionist MPs could not bring themselves to oppose Lloyd George in 1922 after six years of backing him, and one never broke the habit: ""He had become fascinated by Lloyd George.",16
1080,and until the end of his life he would not allow a word of criticism to be heard in his house.,16
1081,"If anything went wrong in any part of the world he always said ""That's because you got rid of the little man"" .",16
1082,"""In the organization too there were exponents of continued cooperation; although Younger worked to defeat coalition in 1922 he did not rule it out as a future possibility.",16
1083,Locally.,16
1084,electoral pacts between Liberals and Unionists to resist municipal Labour created the same direct contacts and in some places the pacts remained for the rest of the inter-war years.,16
1085,"Coalitionism was not then only a political creed, but also a web of friendships and habits that underpinned political cooperation.",16
1086,By 1922 it was for some such a strong attitude as almost to obliterate the normal responses of party.,16
1087,Coalitionists saw well enough the contradiction between politicians who were elected through parties and a government that was the negation of party.,16
1088,and party men saw it too; hence the contentiousness of the various schemes to square the circle by fusing the two coalition partners into one  organization.,16
1089,Coalition had become a political habit that would be quite difficult to break and had sapped the party's confidence in itself.,16
1090,"Most MPs who voted against Lloyd George in 1922 did not envisage a Unionist government as the final outcome, and the defeated ministers did not expect their discomfiture to be permanent.",16
1091,"When coalition died in 1924, not all recognized that coalitionism must die with it.",16
1092,"In the coalition years the party encountered severe difficulties, some endemic to coalition as such, some related to the times, but together they created a general frustration from which the party was lucky to emerge so well.",16
1093,The first source was frustrated ambition: for seven years from 1915 the party had a share of government.,16
1094,but not a full or fair share.,16
1095,"In the Asquith coalition Unionists had eight cabinet posts and Liberals thirteen, although there were far more Unionists in the Commons.",16
1096,"Unionists had a majority in Lloyd George's war cabinet, but were little better placed in his government as a whole.",16
1097,From 1916 Unionist MPs were the only reliable support for the government.,16
1098,"and from 1918 they had a parliamentary majority of their own, with three times as many seats as the rest of the coalition, but they never held as many as half of the government posts.",16
1099,as table 7.1 demonstrates.,16
1100,"At the highest level, Unionists could be satisfied, for they held the most prestigious offices, but the number of jobs was never sufficient to reward the deserving aspirants.",16
1101,"Throughout the coalition, there were never fourteen offices of cabinet or departmental rank to satisfy the combined ambition of 300–359 MPs and a large number of peers.",16
1102,"Normally, the ratio was roughly equivalent to one post for every seven MPs; in coalition, Liberals were appointed on a ratio close to that norm, but Unionists had a proportion of jobs to MPs more like one to twelve or fifteen.",16
1103,"Table 7.1 Unionist share of coalition governments, 1915–1922 Cabinet Unionists in Total no. of Total no. of Ministers cabinet ministers Unionists May 1915 22 8 24 9 December 1916 23 13 32 14 January 1919 21 10 30 14 January 1921 21 12 29 14 October 1922 22 11 29 13 The discontent caused by lack of opportunity can be clearly seen in a number of cases, but was a general phenomenon that affected all but the top dozen in the party's collective leadership.",16
1104,"At its simplest, about a dozen men were not ministers who would have held office in a Unionist government.",16
1105,and about thirty junior men did not hold a post as a result of coalition.,16
1106,"(And this at a time when the Unionists could install their own government whenever they wished, through their control of both Houses.)",16
1107,Selborne had resigned from Asquith s government in 1916 and was not offered a post by Lloyd George.,16
1108,"From the House of Lords and the National Union he became a  thorn in the flesh of the party leaders, where in a party government it would have been inconceivable that such a man, at the height of his powers and with powerful connections.",16
1109,should be left out.,16
1110,"Steel-Maitland had been appointed Party Chairman in 1911 to a post ""of cabinet rank"" , and had served loyally for four years without pay or reward.",16
1111,When the Asquith government was formed there was no post for such a recent recruit to the front bench.,16
1112,He wrote to Law to protest when he was offered only an under secretaryship. pointing out that he had only accepted the Chairmanship the offer of a cabinet post.,16
1113,Law consulted Balfour and replied that Balfour had not promised in such a way as to bind his successor.,16
1114,"that ""of cabinet rank"" did not imply a seat in the cabinet (if not.",16
1115,"it is hard to see what it did imply!), and that all must make sacrifices.",16
1116,"For eighteen months Steel-Maitland worked with Law at the Colonial Office, a useful liaison that kept the leader and Chairman in close touch.",16
1117,When Lloyd George formed his government.,16
1118,"there was a bitter exchange of letters, for Steel-Maitland was now expected to serve under Walter Long.",16
1119,an old enemy.,16
1120,In disgust Steel-Maitland resigned as Party Chairman and in 1919 he despaired of ever getting a senior post and resigned from the government too.,16
1121,"He was a man of strong ambition and had a doubtful reputation as an intriguer, but he was an able man who had deserved better of his party.",16
1122,"After six years as Chairman, he knew all the important party figures and he became a dangerous foe; in the National Union he combined with Selborne to mount a campaign against coalition and as a Birmingham MP he threatened even- Austen Chamberlain's home base.",16
1123,"In normal times, Selborne and Steel-Maitland would have been tolerated and both would have been partially silenced by the restraint of office.",16
1124,The same can be said of the junior ministers who finally wrecked the government in 1922; many of these would have been cabinet ministers in a party government.,16
1125,"as indeed they were in 1922–23, but they had few prospects under coalition.",16
1126,The careers of Bridgeman.,16
1127,"Wood, Amery.",16
1128,"Sanders and Lloyd-Greame would at the least be held up for years by coalition, for there was no room for their promotion.",16
1129,This is not to say that they opposed coalition in 1922 merely from personal motives; they had a legitimate ambition to serve their country and resented what they saw as the promotion of less able Liberals.,16
1130,They could only blame the coalition system.,16
1131,for only a change of system would give them their chance.,16
1132,"In 1918 Sanders thought he had a chance to become Chief Secretary for Ireland, but was soon reduced to considering himself as a possible Speaker; in 1921 he was passed over for Chief Whip because it did not suit the coalition to have such a partisan in so sensitive a post.",16
1133,and he was fobbed off with an under-secretaryship; in 1922 he worked actively to bring the coalition down.,16
1134,The cases of Lord Robert Cecil and Lord Derby illustrate a different truth about coalition.,16
1135,Both held high office under Lloyd George.,16
1136,but both chose eventually to leave the government.,16
1137,"Derby was a weak man whose subservience could usually be taken for granted (in Haig's words he was like  ""the feather pillow [who]bears the marks of the last person who has sat on him"" ), but he was very conscious of his position in the party.",16
1138,"Lloyd George dominated him but could never prise him his party roots; when Lancashire opinion moved coalitionism in 1922 Derby moved with it, and provided the opposition with added credibility.",16
1139,"Cecil was more concerned with policy than with party or personal ambition; he parted company with Lloyd George over the League of Nations and post-war diplomacy; once outside the government he manoeuvred with other discontented ""outs"" .",16
1140,"with Steel-Maitland to project Grey as a possible national leader, and with Salisbury to provide principled leadership for discontented Unionists.",16
1141,"Thus the existence of coalition served to divide the collective leadership by separating those who had power and influence from those who did not, by separating the senior men from their junior colleagues and by cutting off those under the Prime Minister's influence from the rest.",16
1142,Difficulties were accentuated by personal prejudices that had not been broken down.,16
1143,The senior ministers fell easily into the habit of cooperation.,16
1144,but many in the party refused even to attempt the transition.,16
1145,Lloyd George had been the Liberal most hated before 1914 and.,16
1146,"after a brief honeymoon with Unionists in 1917–18, he regained his old standing by 1920.",16
1147,"Early in 1918, a meeting of Unionist leaders considered future relations with Lloyd George and ""Bob Cecil and Curzon [were]against touching him on the ground that he is such a dirty little rogue"" .",16
1148,"To diehards, Lloyd George was ""the"" Welsh Walpole ""and friend of MacDonald who would peddle any opinion and give in to any Labour leader if it would help him to stay in office"" .",16
1149,"Neville Chamberlain referred to him as ""this dirty little Welsh attorney"" and Stanley Baldwin called him, somewhat ambiguously. ""the goat"" .",16
1150,There was then a deep distrust throughout the party.,16
1151,as Law discovered in 1920:,16
1152,Bonar addressed a mass meeting.,16
1153,"He spoke on excess profits, negotiations with Russia and Ireland.",16
1154,His audience was against him on all these questions and there was no enthusiasm.,16
1155,After the meeting he said to one of the local people that it was very unlike the Last Conference in 1913 when he attacked L.G. for 45 minutes amid great applause.,16
1156,"The local man replied ""There would have been as much enthusiasm if you had done the same tonight."" ",16
1157,"The honours scandals, the employment of the press lords, incessant changes of policy, and a profligate waste of money were all taken as signs of the degradation of office by Lloyd George.",16
1158,"Other Coalition Liberals were disliked as warmly as Lloyd George, more for their present policies than for their past.",16
1159,"Edwin Montagu was accused of anti-British motives for his Indian policy; with Reading as Viceroy there were openings for the diehards""latent anti-semitism.",16
1160,Christopher Addison was unpopular his advanced social policy and he was eventually driven out by the Unionists.,16
1161,"But the second to Lloyd George was Churchill, whose war record seemed to prove all that Unionists had alleged about his excitability and his unfitness for office.",16
1162,"Law was very angry when  Churchill was put in office by Lloyd George in 1917, and the National Union resolved that it was ""an insult to the Army and Navy and an injury to the Country"" .",16
1163,The men at the head of coalition Liberalism were therefore execrated as dangerous.,16
1164,corrupt.,16
1165,or irresponsible enemies.,16
1166,and the same gulf separated Unionists from the rest of the party.,16
1167,"especially when the ""coalies"" tried to keep open their avenue of escape by parading their Liberalism.",16
1168,"At Leamington, in May 1920, the coalitionists were finally driven the Liberal party.",16
1169,but Walter Long only noticed what they had said before they were excommunicated:,16
1170,We have been patient.,16
1171,loyal.,16
1172,self-sacrificing and what do we find?,16
1173,Our Liberal colleagues go down to Leamington and ask the audience to believe that they are just as Liberal as ever they were.,16
1174,"In other words that there has been no Coalition, no mutual concessions.",16
1175,but that they have swallowed us.,16
1176,To frustrated ambition was added frustrated partisanship.,16
1177,as Unionists were denied the opportunity to criticize men who were still regarded as enemies.,16
1178,just because they were colleagues.,16
1179,Some refused to accept the restriction but many more nursed resentment in their hearts.,16
1180,"Throughout the coalition Ireland, the Empire and the House of Lords continued to divide Liberals and Unionists as always.",16
1181,Over India the Unionists resented the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms .,16
1182,but nothing stirred their animosity more than the treatment of General Dyer after the massacre at Amritsar.,16
1183,Dyer was applauded by the diehard press to make up for his censure by the government.,16
1184,"and a collection for his benefit soon raised $15,000.",16
1185,"Any post-war government would have met Unionist critics in its reconsideration of Britain's imperial role, but the existence of a bipartisan policy did not help to secure acceptance.",16
1186,Criticism ran along similar lines over Lloyd George's middle eastern policy.,16
1187,and over his preference for Greece over Turkey.,16
1188,Ireland provided a clearer division.,16
1189,"Unionists were critical of Ulster obscurantism when voiced by Carson in 1918 and in no mood to fight another war in Ireland, but neither would they tolerate the coercion of Ulster.",16
1190,"While Asquithians were attacking the Black and Tan policy as immoral, the Unionists were accusing the government of irresolution.",16
1191,"The truce of 1921 was attacked as a typical piece of Lloyd George chicanery, and it needed all the efforts of the party leaders to stop the party from breaking up the government there and then.",16
1192,Finally.,16
1193,the House of Lords was a prime domestic reason for Unionist acceptance of coalition.,16
1194,but a constant source of friction.,16
1195,"No agreed reform plan had been forthcoming in 1917–18 but it remained an agreed priority of the government to the end, and pledge after pledge was given.",16
1196,Each year it was put off the impossibility of devising an acceptable scheme.,16
1197,It was exactly the issue that could be best settled by a bipartisan government.,16
1198,"for that would avoid charges of the gerrymandering of the constitution; time would show whether the coalition would deliver the goods, and coalition would be judged accordingly.",16
1199,In all these policy questions.,16
1200,and in the others that still separated the parties.,16
1201,"the party reacted as an independent group and not as a partner, for the Lloyd George government was never a focus of loyalty for Unionists.",16
1202,Complaints about government appointments or policies could only be met by Law with the barren reply that the party could not expect total control and that in coalition such things must happen — which is just what the critics were saying too.,16
1203,"Individual Unionists played important parts in the government and many Unionist policies were implemented , but the party as a whole never took the government to heart as its own.",16
1204,The party never indeed accepted coalition as an idea; a majority of MPs accepted the advice of its leaders to keep the actual government in being.,16
1205,"but it was always a decision for now, never one for always.",16
1206,Coalition thus involved inevitable difficulties which could only be kept in check the sense of crisis lasted.,16
1207,The decision to continue collaboration after 1918 can only be understood through the actual events of that year.,16
1208,Active consideration of the future began early in the year.,16
1209,for a general election could not be long delayed after the new franchise came into effect and the war was at a particularly gloomy stage.,16
1210,"No advice to the government expected victory before 1919 at the earliest, and after the rout of the Fifth Army in March 1918 defeat stared the government in the face.",16
1211,"So in the winter of 1917–18 murmurs of opposition began to grow louder than at any time since Lloyd George became Prime Minister, the Asquithians revived their interest as they scented a chance to bring Lloyd George down.",16
1212,and the press became more hostile — The Times and the Morning Post as well as the Liberal papers.,16
1213,The idea of a general election was therefore a tempting one for the government.,16
1214,for a khaki election like that of 1900 would present the government as the war party and leave Asquith and the Labour party no way to avert destruction.,16
1215,"In March 1918 the Unionist leaders agreed to open up negotiations with Lloyd George's supporters and set up a subcommittee of Law, Long.",16
1216,Younger and Clyde to investigate.,16
1217,"Behind the scenes talks about a coalition programme were initiated and the party""managers met to share out the candidatures for the projected election.",16
1218,"By July an outline agreement had been presented to Law and Lloyd George, by which 150 seats were allocated to Coalition Liberals, but no decision of principle was taken.",16
1219,"Throughout this tine, the assumption was that the government was seeking a mandate to continue the war, and as late as October Bonar Law could still see ""almost no chance of any joint action of this kind unless it is begun as the result of an election which takes place during the war and under the pressure of war conditions"" .",16
1220,But by that time a renewed coalition and a coalition election would not be arranged to get a mandate for war to reap the benefits of victory.,16
1221,"A few months later Sanders recalled that Lloyd George had""prophesied great unpopularity for the government during the period of demobilisation and said if we had an election in the Spring we might get a  Bolshevik Government.",16
1222,"I always held that view and did all I could to press for an election before Christmas that we might get a majority large enough to stand the racket.""",16
1223,In the course of negotiation.,16
1224,the Unionist leaders realized how much of their own programme could be extracted from Lloyd George.,16
1225,and they recognized too the enormous boost to his prestige that had come with victory.,16
1226,"For Law, the issue was that many Unionists would in any case feel compelled to support Lloyd George and that he might command a large personal following in the constituencies; it would be useful to capture him as Joseph Chamberlain had been captured in 1886.",16
1227,"There was then little belief in the value of the Coalition Liberals, but a strong belief in the value of Lloyd George; he would be a good advocate with the new electorate and he would in due course be disarmed as Chamberlain had been.",16
1228,"As Law told Balfour,""that would be not a bad thing for our Party.",16
1229,"and a good thing for the nation"".",16
1230,"The final decision was taken at the end of October, with victory only a few days away, and was announced with the publication of a letter from Lloyd George to Bonar Law, a letter actually drafted by Law as a summary of their agreement.",16
1231,"By the time that the deal was presented to Unionist MPs on 12 November, two important developments had taken place.",16
1232,"The war had come to an end, so an election would now be very soon indeed, and Asquith had turned down Lloyd George's suggestion that he rejoin the government.",16
1233,"Law supported the offer to Asquith, and it was logical for him to do so; a government bent on post-war reconstruct on and resistance to Labour would be strengthened by Asquith's presence.",16
1234,But Asquith's refusal greatly strengthened the Unionist position.,16
1235,as it left Lloyd George wholly dependent on his allies.,16
1236,"The deal done between the Whips was in any case a good one for the Unionists: Coalition Liberals would have a free run in 150 constituencies (a figure suggested by Guest, but then rigidly adhered to by Younger).",16
1237,"but Unionists would have twice as many, and they would now be free to attack sitting Asquithians too, and with Lloyd George as an ally.",16
1238,The joint manifesto proclaimed that imperialism would be the coalition's chief objective.,16
1239,and on specific issues that interested the Unionists Lloyd George promised an open mind on tariffs and no coercion of Ulster.,16
1240,"Commending this agreement to his followers, Law was anxious that they recognise the advantage of Lloyd George as an ally, for ""at this moment, Mr Lloyd George commands an amount of influence in every constituency as great as has ever been exercised by any Prime Minister"" .",16
1241,"Law was equally keen to point out that little was being risked, and to set at rest the fears of his supporters:",16
1242,What I propose does not mean that our Party is going to cease to exist.,16
1243,We go into this election — if I have my way — as a Unionist Party forming a portion of a coalition.,16
1244,I should be sorry if it were otherwise.,16
1245,From the time that my colleagues in the House of Commons did me the honour of electing me to be their leader I  have felt that I was in the position of a trustee; and even throughout the war the one thing that I have aimed at constantly has been to preserve.,16
1246,"if it could be done, the unity of our Party.",16
1247,"What was proposed was not the submersion of party in a wider unit, but a parliament of collaboration between independent groups; no more was discussed in 1918 and, despite the strength of the arguments for further collaboration, they would scarcely have carried the party to a greater commitment.",16
1248,The scale of what had been achieved in capturing Lloyd George was underlined by incidents surrounding the letter of agreement between Law and Lloyd George.,16
1249,"At the meeting of Unionists of 12 November, Law read the letter and impressed his audience with the concessions that Lloyd George seemed ready to make.",16
1250,At the meeting of Coalition Liberals though.,16
1251,Lloyd George gave only a summary of the letter and stressed its Liberal contents.,16
1252,"When MPs returned to the Commons, it soon became clear that all was not well, as Robert Sanders noted:",16
1253,Our people became suspicious .,16
1254,I spoke to Guest and urged the publication of the letter.,16
1255,On Wednesday afternoon [13 Nov.],16
1256,"Bonar sent me word to come to Downing Street where I found L.G., Balfour, Bonar, and Auckland Geddes.",16
1257,Meanwhile there had appeared in The Times a fairly full report of L.G.'s speech to his own followers.,16
1258,L.G. said it must have been sent by someone in the audience who could write shorthand.,16
1259,He said he spoke impromptu.,16
1260,that he had a difficult job and that he was anxious to make things easy for his Liberal supporters.,16
1261,"It was agreed that a joint meeting should be held, at which he, Bonar and Barnes should speak.",16
1262,I pressed for the publication of the letter.,16
1263,L.G. rather deprecated that saying he was not in love with it.,16
1264,"Further pressure was applied by the Unionists and the joint meeting on the 16th went off well, with ""the famous letter"" duly printed and handed out.",16
1265,Unionists were only interested in a deal that would make Lloyd George's capture public.,16
1266,both to give them maximum advantage at the coming election and to spread the maximum disaffection in the Liberal party.,16
1267,"The election was announced, parliament was dissolved, and polling arranged for 14 December.",16
1268,"One problem remained to be settled, which was the working the electoral pact.",16
1269,"No details were given to the National Union or to the constituencies involved, so much hard work had to be done and much recrimination endured before the party could settle down to the campaign.",16
1270,"Overall the party had done very well, getting 362 of the 531 ""coupons"" that were offered by Lloyd George and Law to approved candidates, but locally the position could look very different.",16
1271,"In Wales the Unionists had only two coupons twenty-two, because most of the sitting Liberals backed Lloyd George, but this did not much impress Welsh Unionists.",16
1272,"In Brightside the Unionist candidate had been specially demobilised for the election; the Central Office agent for Yorkshire persuaded him to stand down, but it took a  visit to Central Office before his supporters could be persuaded to support a Coalition Liberal that they had opposed at the last three elections.",16
1273,"It was only the fear of Labour and strong pressure from Central Office, including the withdrawal of financial aid, that kept the local parties in line, and some rash promises had to be made.",16
1274,So in Banbury and in Newport local Unionists were assured that the deal was for one election only.,16
1275,"and that acceptance would not preclude them from running a Unionist next time, promises that caused trouble later.",16
1276,Leigh Maclachlan of Central Office later recalled the anguish that such talks caused there:,16
1277,Deputation after deputation came pouring in from constituencies whose candidatures had been assigned to Lloyd George Liberals.,16
1278,", after one particularly painful interview, Sir Robert Sanders, looking thoroughly upset.",16
1279,"turned to the writer and said""You must see any further deputations there may be.",16
1280,"I won't be a party to turning down any more of these good fellows.""",16
1281,Financial control may have been a vital weapon.,16
1282,for the local parties that defied the pact were mostly from strong and independent city parties used to financial independence.,16
1283,"Overall, though, only nineteen Unionists stood against couponed opponents; in only one constituency.",16
1284,Morpeth.,16
1285,did such Unionist defiance cost the coalition the seat.,16
1286,"On the other hand, five of the nineteen rebels won comfortably on their own, against Coalition Liberals, Labour, the coupon, and their own leaders.",16
1287,A case can be made out for the 1918 election as a Unionist victory a coalition victory.,16
1288,"Unionists had some success against the coupon and even more in places where no coupons were allocated, as in Cardiff and in Manchester.",16
1289,"The issues of the election were certainly more likely to benefit Unionists than anyone else: an outspoken patriotism, a pursuit of the fallen foe, and a call to restore the conditions of 1914.""",16
1290,"Lloyd George received a hero's welcome wherever he went, but then so did Churchill in 1945, and it is impossible to tell now whether Lloyd George would have fared so well if he had had Liberals Unionists at his back.",16
1291,Unionist candidates used his letter to Law as an election leaflet to reassure their supporters and to parade his capture to the nation.,16
1292,"There is little doubt that the coalition was returned to power mainly on Unionist votes, although this was not widely recognized at the time; the Unionists had never won so many votes before, and it was perhaps natural to attribute their success to their new asset.",16
1293,In the general pattern of inter-war elections though.,16
1294,"1918 fits in easily enough: in 1922 the party won the same share of the vote with a similar number of candidates, but without Lloyd George.",16
1295,"The scale of the triumph of 1918 owed something to Lloyd George, but the fact of Unionist victory did not, for without the pact the party would certainly have won some of the Coalition Liberal seats that it prevented them from attacking.",16
1296,and these would have made up for some of the others perhaps won for them by Lloyd George.,16
1297,It may even be that the coupon helped to limit the size of the Unionist victory and to prolong the life of the Liberal Party.,16
1298,In parliament there was no mistaking the size of the victory: there were 382 Unionist MPs 707: without the Unionist preponderance became overwhelming.,16
1299,"Not all Unionist MPs ever supported the coalition, but almost all of them took the Whip at some time; the Unionists made up three-quarters of the government side of the House.",16
1300,Unionists therefore looked forward to domination of the government: but this never happened.,16
1301,and the party as a whole played only a junior role for the next four years.,16
1302,"Their majority gave Unionist MPs a virtual veto over policies and appointments in the long run, but their junior position in government prevented any more positive control.",16
1303,"This tension led attempts to fuse the government parties in 1920, to the failure of almost every government policy, and to complete deadlock by 1921.",16
1304,Fusion became possible in 1920 the difficulties already met by the government.,16
1305,"Lloyd George's absence in Paris had accentuated the arguments about policy; peacemaking had produced a major Unionist rebellion in a telegram to Lloyd George from 233 Unionist Mrs in April 1919, urging stronger action on reparations; the appointments of F. E. Smith as Lord Chancellor (as Lord Birkenhead).",16
1306,"and of Churchill and Addison, had been much criticised.",16
1307,"The attack on Birkenhead was especially revealing; it centred on his lack of gravity in the highest legal office, but it was occasioned too by his lack of concern for party in the excitement of office.",16
1308,"Unionists also resisted Lloyd Georges attempt to go on running things as in wartime, insisting that the war cabinet should be wound up after peacemaking was completed.",16
1309,Nor did they like Addison's reconstruction plans: his Ministry of Ways and Communications Bill was eventually passed.,16
1310,setting up a Ministry of Transport.,16
1311,but only after Unionist MPs had shorn it of railway and electricity nationalization.,16
1312,Similar action forced the abandonment of coal nationalization after the Sankey Report.,16
1313,and of parts of the Excess Profits Tax.,16
1314,"Bonar Law was now Leader of the House of Commons without a department, and it was indeed a full-time job to keep the governmental process going there.",16
1315,Outside Westminster the government was losing support: eight seats were lost at by-elections in the first eighteen months of peace.,16
1316,Turnout rose as the opposition parties recovered from their disarray of 1918 and there was a large turnover of votes.,16
1317,"When local elections were resumed in 1919 there was a large Labour advance, and only local pacts stemmed the tide in 1920.",16
1318,"The weakness of the government at its roots was demonstrated by the events at Stockport in March 1920, when a vacancy occurred there; weeks of argument were solved only by the resignation of the other sitting member, there could be a double by-election with one Unionist and one Liberal candidate as in 1918.",16
1319,By the time Stockport had been settled Lloyd George was moving to prevent such situations from recurring.,16
1320,"He proposed the fusion of the two coalition parties into a new party, which would be launched on an inspiring  programme of strong government and social betterment.",16
1321,The serious economic situation and the delicate state of Labour relations demanded a stronger government to hold the ring.,16
1322,for the attempt at fusion took place just a month before the post-war boom began to collapse.,16
1323,"a development that punctured the inflationary crisis and took""the heat the Labour militancy.",16
1324,"So, for various different reasons, most of the Unionist leaders approved of Lloyd George's intentions; the party managers agreed because they feared that continuing disorganization on the Coalition Liberal side might eventually wreck the government.",16
1325,Birkenhead put the case for a new party in articles in the Weekly Dispatch.,16
1326,"a round robin from ninety-five MPs supported fusion, and Balfour formally proposed fusion in a letter to Bonar Law on 10 March 1920.",16
1327,"Other Unionists, including Law himself, were less sure, they shared their colleagues""concern about the political and economic situation; nevertheless it was agreed to go ahead, but that Lloyd George should make the first move.",16
1328,"Lloyd George would propose fusion to his Liberal supporters, and Bonar Law would follow suit on the next day.",16
1329,"In the event the reactions of Coalition Liberal ministers were so uniformly hostile that Lloyd George moved quickly into reverse; when he met Coalition Liberal MPs, he merely suggested greater cooperation with Unionists and did not mention fusion as such.",16
1330,"Bonar Law promptly gave up the whole idea, with obvious relief, as he told Balfour:",16
1331,The result of this will probably be not to attempt any real fusion of the Parties but to get cooperation.,16
1332,something on the lines of the Liberal Unionists and Conservatives in the early days.,16
1333,"This will be difficult to arrange and will certainly not be efficient, but personally I am not sorry at the turn events have taken.",16
1334,"I do not like the idea of complete fusion if it can be avoided, but I had come to think, as you had also, that it was really inevitable if the Coalition were to continue.",16
1335,But it always seemed to me more important from L.G.'s point of view than from ours.,16
1336,"As a Party we were losing nothing and, since the necessity of going slowly in the matter has come from L.G.'s own friends, I do not regret it.",16
1337,"In March 1920, as in November 1918, Lloyd George's open dependence on the Unionists had been openly demonstrated.",16
1338,"When the Coalitionists were driven the Liberal fold at Leamington in the following May dependence became even greater, for it removed the only theoretical alternative that Lloyd George and his friends had left.",16
1339,It remains to decide whether the Unionists would have accepted fusion if Lloyd George could have made it a real option in 1920.,16
1340,"The party in the Commons would probably have done so, though not without a severing of all connections by a determined minority; there is little doubt though that the party outside parliament would not have accepted fusion, or that they could have prevented its implementation.",16
1341,The parliamentary party could determine the shape of governments and election campaigns.,16
1342,but they could not change the structure of the party itself without a positive vote from the National Union and overwhelming approval in the constituencies.,16
1343,"At the Party  Conference of 1920, which coalitionists had hoped would approve fusion, it was estimated that about five-eighths of the delegates were the existence of the coalition, and the rest against it on principle, but that hardly any of them approved its current policies.",16
1344,"The Executive elected at that Conference was packed with diehards, and ""a debate on cooperation against Labour revealed the depth of division: a motion calling for closer collaboration met strong opposition, but so did one calling simply for a Unionist government: They must turn out the man who was the greatest danger to the Conservative Party"" ,(a voice — ""Lloyd George"" ).",16
1345," ""Yes, if you allow conditions to continue as you will find a deliberate attempt is being made to assassinate the Conservative Party."" ",16
1346,"In the end a meaningless compromise was made, and the Conference called on all good men to come together to resist socialism, but also insisted that the Unionist party should not sacrifice any of its independence in the process.",16
1347,"It is difficult to see how this Conference could""possibly have approved fusion; it had done, half the constituencies would probably have refused to implement the decision.",16
1348,"A motion which would have specifically committed]the party against fusion was not put on the chairman's decision; the diehards accepted this ruling without demur, because they felt that they had already made their point.",16
1349,"Bonar Law's position remains enigmatic, for he promoted fusion and yet was glad to see it fail.",16
1350,"He was never an ideological coalitionist and never fell under L.G.'s spell, for all their good personal relations.",16
1351,"Had his colleagues backed fusion in 1920 Law would have accepted it, but he would hardly have stuck to that position in the party crisis that must have followed.",16
1352,His relief in avoiding such a parting of the ways is understandable.,16
1353,"With the failure of fusion, and with the subsequent failure of Liberal reunion in May 1920, the coalition settled into a stage of continuous crisis.",16
1354,"The deepening economic recession defused the worst industrial problems, but the failure of fusion had deprived the government of the only way of bringing coalition and party into line.",16
1355,"time was on the side of the anti-coalitionists, for the approach of another election would eventually reopen the argument to their advantage.",16
1356,"By the time of the next possible resolution of the problem at the end of 1921, coalition had signally failed to provide Unionists with what they had hoped for, and Lloyd George had become an electoral albatross an asset.",16
1357,"The failure of the programme of 1918 stemmed above all from the lack of real agreement at the time; despite the negotiations, the coalition's electoral manifesto and campaign of 1918 went little further than Lloyd George's letter to Bonar Law.",16
1358,"When coalition ministers began to bring forward legislation in 1919 they met a hail of criticism, from Liberals hostile to decontrol and Unionists lukewarm on social reconstruction.",16
1359,"To keep all his supporters in balance, Lloyd George had to offer something to all of them, but this meant that every coalition scheme was also hotly opposed by a part of the coalition.",16
1360,"Lloyd George disarmed his opponents on Ireland with his Russian policy, and his opponents on Russia with his Irish policy, and they did not combine to oppose him.",16
1361,Another example of this division of opponents was the Amritsar Debate of July 1920.,16
1362,Conservative MPs.,16
1363,voted 122 to 93 against the government.,16
1364,Lloyd George was upheld in this division by the votes of Labour and Asquithian Liberal M.P.s who at the time vigorously opposed his repression of Ireland.,16
1365,Such a balancing act could keep his government in being only by increasing his own reputation for lack of principle.,16
1366,"a systematic policy of imperialism, Unionists had Montagu's Indian policy and Milner's policy in Egypt; settlement in Ireland there were outrages; a broad social policy there was first a reckless waste of money and then an abandonment of almost all that had been proposed.",16
1367,"In only one area did the coalition succeed totally, but this argument was a double-edged sword: Lloyd George had weathered the storm of labour unrest, and after ""Black Friday"" this was clearly abating.",16
1368,"What was now needed was a means of countering Labour's electoral appeal, and for this a Prime Minister with a cleaner political reputation would be needed.",16
1369,"The more the revolutionary threat receded, and the more Lloyd George appeared as a loser of votes, the more the Unionists would be tempted to cast him adrift.",16
1370,"In most of this Lloyd George was desperately unlucky, both in the failures and reconsiderations of policy and in the development of his own reputation.",16
1371,"Many coalition schemes were wrecked by Unionist hostility, yet Unionists also complained when the government then changed course.",16
1372,"The following scenario was typical: government introduces social scheme balanced to meet Liberal and Unionist influence in government, but tilted slightly to Liberalism by the minister in charge; Unionists in the House of Commons wreck the plan and denounce the waste of public money; government withdraws the scheme and is then accused of unprincipled change of front by Unionists.",16
1373,Such was the logic of coalition when the balance of the government did not correspond to the balance of parliament.,16
1374,"Successes of the government would always be claimed by all its members, but failures would be left to the Prime Minister.",16
1375,Rapid changes of policy were in any case dictated by circumstances.,16
1376,"The uncertain foreign situation was typified in Eastern Europe where in 1920 the Poles seemed likely to extinguish the Bolshevik regime, and a year later the Bolsheviks almost took Warsaw.",16
1377,At home the sudden switch from inflation and boom to stagnation and slump in a few months made changes in policy inevitable.,16
1378,Ireland was a nightmare for all parties; the fifty-year respite gained by Lloyd George in 1921 was certainly based on pragmatism principle but no other policy could have worked.,16
1379,"In field after field the government was forced to change course, earning a reputation for dishonesty and lack of principle that, when allied to Lloyd George's prior reputation, could only do him great damage.",16
1380,Nothing exemplified this more than the campaign for public economy which shook the government in 1921.,16
1381,A public  that had seen income tax rise fivefold in five years were only too ready to believe that their money was being wasted.,16
1382,"During the war the national crisis kept discontent within bounds, but when income tax actually went up again in 1919 (to pay amongst other things-for homes for heroes) the reaction of taxpayers was very hostile indeed, especially when in 1920 inflation reached unprecedented levels too.",16
1383,"The first to sense the new mood was the press, and an Anti-Waste League was founded by Lord Rothermere.",16
1384,"Two by-elections at the Wrekin and one at Dover showed the threat that independents could pose on the anti-spending tack, and Lord Salisbury tried to guide the agitation into respectable channels through a People's Union for Economy.",16
1385,"Two further Anti-Waste victories in June 1921, on Salisbury's doorstep in Hertford and in the ultra-safe Unionist seat of St George's Westminster, were too threatening to be ignored.",16
1386,"Government spending had already been reviewed and cut substantially, but the time had now come for a great public gesture; this was supplied by the appointment of the Geddes Committee, a typical Lloyd George manoeuvre using businessmen MPs or ministers.",16
1387,"When the ""Geddes Axe"" fell in February 1922, it proposed cuts in the social services which alienated the Prime Minister's last admirers on the left; moderate Unionists like Stanley Baldwin disliked the Geddes Axe as being too arbitrary and too indiscriminate, but the rest of the party criticized it as too little, too late, and unlikely to be implemented anyway.",16
1388,"Resolutions continued to call for further economies and lower taxation, so the government got no credit for what it had done.",16
1389,"After the summer of 1921 the Anti-Waste threat receded, but this was largely because Unionist candidates were now on the bandwagon with them, demanding cuts as loudly as anyone.",16
1390,"After St George's, almost all Unionist candidates ran without making promises to support the coalition; this did not mean that all of them joined the diehard group when elected, but it showed that coalition was seen to be a winning ticket.",16
1391,By 1921 indeed frustration with coalition was building up such a head of steam as seriously to threaten its future.,16
1392,"The party managers continued to bewail the organizational weakness of Coalition Liberalism, but there had been little opportunity for organizational collaboration; one of the few joint ventures, a magazine called Popular View, was abandoned in 1921 the impossibility of producing a lively magazine continuous compromise.",16
1393,"Money was short in the party by 1921 because there had been no proper revival since the war; members were constantly described as apathetic, and were in no mood to give their time or their money to a party that did not know where it was going.",16
1394,"The state of the organization was causing concern to the party managers, for it would deteriorate further unless some definite decision about the future were taken.",16
1395,"At the end of 1921 Younger still favoured coalition, but the balance had become a fine one.",16
1396,"The National Union had much less doubt, and by 1921 it was committed firmly against coalition.",16
1397,"Younger was in a very exposed position, for he was  Chairman of the National Union Executive responsible for carrying out its decisions, Party Chairman and so committed to the leader and the coalition.",16
1398,He tried to escape the cross-fire by getting the two offices separated but could not get the new rules approved.,16
1399,"The actual administration of the National Union was separated from Central Office in 1921, and it appointed its own secretary thereafter; it was a change of no great importance, for the National Union continued to work from Central Office and the Principal Agent continued to be Honorary Secretary, but it was a minor declaration of independence.",16
1400,"The question that exercised the National Union most of all was the House of Lords, and regular deputations were sent to Law to press for action.",16
1401,By early 1922 tempers were short and the Chairman of the Central Council publicized the dispute in March with an open letter to Austen Chamberlain.,16
1402,"This brought a reply from Salvidge, still a convinced coalitionist:",16
1403,I read with amazement Sir Alexander Leith's letter to you in this morning's press.,16
1404,The inference in his letter is that he speaks for the Council of the National Union of which he is chairman.,16
1405,"As a member of that Council I emphatically deny that he has had any mandate, or that he is justified in assuming that the Council as a whole takes his view.",16
1406,"Despite Austen's soothing reply, Salvidge took the matter up at the next meeting of the Executive, when he demanded Leith had been satisfied with Austen's reply.",16
1407,"Salvidge was right to claim that Leith had overstepped the mark and that he had no mandate for his action, but it is clear that he Salvidge really represented the views of the National Union.",16
1408,In March he explained that he had acted in a personal capacity only and that Chamberlain had suggested that their correspondence be published.,16
1409,"At the May Executive the government was rapped over the knuckles for its failure to reform the House of Lords, ""a breach of the understanding upon which the allegiance of the Unionist Party to its leaders depends"" .",16
1410,"Salvidge proposed to delete these insulting words but could not even find a seconder; nine MPs were present, including Younger, Sanders and Neville Chamberlain, all of whom must have approved of the resolution or seen the futility of attempting to amend it.",16
1411,"The National Union also reacted fiercely to the attacks on Younger by coalitionist ministers, most of all Birkenhead's description of him as ""the cabin boy"" and Lloyd George's of ""a second-class brewer"" .",16
1412,There were fears that it was intended to remove him and substitute someone more acquiescent.,16
1413,"In March 1922 Steel-Maitland proposed a strong motion of confidence in Younger that was a clear rebuke to his critics; Younger lowered the temperature by asking Steel-Maitland to withdraw the motion, but the Executive accepted this only ""on the understanding that Sir Laming Worthington-Evans would make known to his colleagues in the Government that the Committee would bring the matter up again unless the attacks by Ministers on Sir George Younger ceased"" .",16
1414,The National Union was then hostile to coalition and quite determined to use its independence if  necessary to protect the interests of the party.,16
1415,The views of the local parties were less clearcut — although the National Union itself was no more than the sum of the local party leaders.,16
1416,"There was support for coalition in the North and in Scotland, where local cooperation was pushing back municipal socialism in 1920–21, and also in Birmingham, where Austen Chamberlain traded on the family name and Neville brooded uneasily on the course of events.",16
1417,"In southern England, there was forthright opposition, for here the benefit of cooperation was negligible and the Labour threat more remote.",16
1418,"Sanders found that Somerset was almost wholly hostile to coalition, and Middlesex and London were both equally critical.",16
1419,"It was the assurances of 1918 that the pact would be for one election only came home to roost; wanting to be ready in plenty of time, many local parties were by 1921 selecting candidates who would oppose sitting Coalition Liberals.",16
1420,"In Newport it was the Licensing Act of 1921 that brought about this decision, but in other places it was India, or Ireland, or public spending.",16
1421,Local parties also pressed sitting MPs to declare that they would fight next time without the coalition label and many gave way to these suggestions.,16
1422,"Local parties were not very representative of Unionist voters, but this did not affect their independence or their control over their candidates.",16
1423,There was little to be done to prevent this inexorable build up of pressure from the roots.,16
1424,"Taking the lead against the coalition was a small but implacable group of diehards; they were never more than a few dozen in the Commons and, although they attracted shifting support on particular issues, they never threatened the coalition majority.",16
1425,"The Lords were more diehard, as they had been ever since 1911, but unless their powers were restored they would denounce the government .",16
1426,"Diehard opinions ranged from the virulent obscurantism of Northumberland, Page Croft and Cooper, who saw politics as a black-and-white struggle between good British imperial-minded Christians and Jewish-dominated marxist wreckers, to the high-minded Association of Independent Peers, who were primarily concerned with the effect of coalition on the standards of public life and its failure to halt the drift towards class politics.",16
1427,"The strongest weapon in the diehard armoury was the press, for it had the reliable support of the Morning Post, National Review and Spectator, and intermittent backing from the papers of Beaverbrook, Rothermere and Northcliffe.",16
1428,"Of the Unionist press, only the Daily Telegraph supported the coalition, and it could make little head against such a tide.",16
1429,"This motley bunch of adventurers, undesirables and patriots had by 1921 accepted the general lead of Lord Salisbury.",16
1430,"As the son of a Unionist Prime Minister, Salisbury used his name and connections to weld the diehard opposition together and awaited his opportunity.",16
1431,"He was desperately worried that coalition, as a cynical combination to keep Labour down, would produce a reaction among working-class electors that would eventually put Labour in power.",16
1432,This was the most respectable strain of Unionist opposition to the  coalition.,16
1433,"When the Unionist won the by-election at Newport in 1922, on working-class votes and on an anti-coalition platform, his agent explained that""the working classes had never understood the Coalition.",16
1434,"They had regarded it rightly or wrongly as a wangle and as an attempt to ally capitalist forces against the worker.""",16
1435,"It was such fears that Salisbury set out to quieten, using his People's Union for Economy to widen the diehards""appeal, and calling for a return to the classless tradition of Conservatism.",16
1436,"His own group called itself the Free Conservatives, set up an office to rival that of the official party, and supplied money and professional assistance to rebels at by-elections.",16
1437,"Salisbury did not share half the views held by those who accepted his lead, but he was a focus for the increasing Unionist discontent, a respectable public figure acting from the highest motives; by 1921 he had made the diehard opposition a formidable force.",16
1438,In any calculation of the party's future prospects Bonar Law would be a key figure.,16
1439,"Throughout the coalition, Law was prepared to support its continuation, but he was rarely prepared to argue for concession that would weaken his own party.",16
1440,"he got on very well with Lloyd George, but he never hid his doubts; in 1917 he told Unionists that Lloyd George was a man who has the defects of his qualities"", and told his audience that he was saying no more than he had told the Prime Minister to his face; when in 1920 he was told that Unionists would rather hear him attack Lloyd George than defend him, he told this story to the Prime Minister too.",16
1441,"For ten years Law had been at the heart of the party's reactions to political events, largely because his own views mirrored those of his followers almost exactly.",16
1442,"The extreme diehards had written off Law as the dupe of Lloyd George because he did not come out fighting against coalition policies, hence the witticism that the coalition was an alliance between a flock of sheep led by a, crook and a flock of crooks led by a sheep.",16
1443,"But to the bulk of the party, Law s presence in government was a guarantee of the party's independence; with Law in charge the party would extract from coalition whatever there was to be gained, but at no risk, and when stripped of all complications this was more or less what Bonar Law intended all along.",16
1444,"He was therefore as vital a figure as Salisbury, and in something of the same way: Salisbury was the link between the anti-coalition forces outside the government, and Law was the link between anti-coalitionists outside and critical Unionists within.",16
1445,"Successive crises were dealt with by Law without resolving the fundamental disequilibrium of the situation, for the conflict between coalition and party was as real in Law's own mind as in the minds of a host of Unionists who continued to give general support to the government.",16
1446,It was therefore an event of major significance when Law's retirement was announced in March 1921.,16
1447,He had been unwell for some time and had now gone into a state of collapse.,16
1448,"Lloyd George announced his resignation to the Commons on 17 March in a speech that was close to tears, and the reaction of Unionist MPs was equally emotional, testament to Law's great standing in his  party.",16
1449,The effect of the resignation was increased by its suddenness: within two days Law had laid down all his offices and gone abroad.,16
1450,"Maurice Cowling has suggested that Law's resignation was tactical, that he could not face reconciling his party to the coming Irish negotiations, and that he was giving up office to be available as an alternative to coalition in the future; in Gaullist terms he was becoming a Prime Minister ""in the reserve of the republic"" .",16
1451,"Lloyd George perhaps entertained similar doubts, for his first reactions were to suggest that he should resign too, and to ask if he might speak to Bonar Law's doctor.",16
1452,"But there can be no real doubt that it was on medical advice that Law resigned, for he was advised that only a complete break would save him from total breakdown, and he was actually suffering from the disease that was to kill him in three years.",16
1453,"For six months in 1921 Law was in France, cut off from most political information and from all political action.",16
1454,His position after his return in September should not affect the assessment of his resignation in March.,16
1455,"The effect of Law's abrupt departure was magnified by the departure at about the same time of Walter Long, the only other Unionist of weight who combined an acceptance of coalition (as a defence against Labour) with a determination that the integrity of the party should not be compromised in any way.",16
1456,"Long's health had been deteriorating for years, but he had kept open his channels of communication; like Law his influence was based on years of devotion to the interests of the party, and like Law's that influence had been used to argue the case for coalition.",16
1457,In February 1921 he gave up office and soon afterwards he accepted a peerage and retired from active politics.,16
1458,"With the passing of Law and Long there were no Unionists in the cabinet who had both authority and detachment; the link had been broken, but its importance was demonstrated with devastating effect when both intervened to influence the events of October 1922.",16
1459,"By this time Long would not have been a possible leader, and so the third contender of 1911 alone remained: Austen Chamberlain.",16
1460,"There was some speculation about alternatives, with some canvassing the claims of Derby and Salisbury and others imploring Lloyd George to take over the leadership and unite the parties in a shotgun wedding, but Austen's claims were undeniable.",16
1461,"He was elected leader of the party at the Carlton Club on 21 March 1921, proposed by Captain Pretyman who coined in his speech the idea that Conservative leaders ""emerged"" being elected.",16
1462,"Austen had certainly emerged as leader, for nobody could have stood against him with any prospect of success, and it was appropriate that his succession should be marked by Pretyman, who was a respected backbencher of long service and represented the inarticulate centre of the party.",16
1463,"At the time of his election, Austen was seen as a party man who would be even more attentive to Unionist interests than Law had been.",16
1464,"This was a natural enough view for those who remembered his tariff opinions before the war, his stout defence of Ulster and his diehard opinions in 1911.",16
1465,"But by 1921  Austen was an ideological coalitionist for both personal and tactical reasons: he had fallen under the personal sway of Lloyd George, he was influenced by Birkenhead and Horne, and he had no doubt that a coalition alone would be able to contain Labour.",16
1466,The intolerance he had shown for free-traders before 1914 was now turned on rebel Unionists who rocked the coalition boat.,16
1467,"He had perhaps been too long in high office, too isolated from discordant views by the well-oiled Birmingham machine to take full account of the volume of dissent.",16
1468,Any doubt about his attitude should have been set aside by the speech with which he accepted the leadership:,16
1469,"There are moments when the insistence upon party is as unforgiveable as insistence upon personal things, when the difficulties which the nation has to confront call for a wider outlook and a broader union than can be found even within the limits of a single party, and when the traditions of one party, the ideas of one party need to be put into the common stock.",16
1470,"For the next eighteen months, Austen Chamberlain worked behind the scenes to maintain the interests of his party, just as Law had done, but he had no personal sympathy for the diehards or their views, and he made no gestures of conciliation to them.",16
1471,"His public speeches were all aimed at converting the party to a positive belief in coalition, leading it from the front — and in a direction where many Unionists did not wish to follow.",16
1472,In losing Law the party had lost a conciliator; in electing Austen it had gained an inflexible leader who would not always put party first.,16

2,"My co-author and friend Professor A. R. Collar, C.B.E., LL.D., F.R.S., Emeritus Professor of Aeronautical Engineering in the University of Bristol, distinguished aeronautical scientist and former Vice-Chancellor of that University, died at his home in Bristol on 12th February 1986, just ten days before his 78th birthday, and only a short time before our book was published.",17
3,Roderick's eminence as an engineering scientist and scholar is well known.,17
4,"However, he was also a man of exceptional personal warmth and charm.",17
5,"He was, in every sense, a gentleman and a gentle man.",17
6,"Nevertheless, when the occasion demanded it (as it did during the turbulent period in which he became Vice-Chancellor of Bristol University), he showed great courage and firmness — the latter always in the nicest possible way.",17
7,"Roderick's interests were wide; sport (cricket, tennis and football — both varieties), good music (he played the violin), verse (he read extensively and composed, when inspired or provoked, to match an occasion and could recite extensively from memory — particularly W. S. Gilbert), games and puzzles (chess, cribbage, mathematical conundrums and crosswords; he could, at his zenith, do The Times Crossword any day in twenty minutes), and art (he was an active member of The Bristol Savages).",17
8,He was also president of a local Gilbert and Sullivan society for many years.,17
9,He did much hospital work: for several years his retirement he had been Chairman of the South West Regional Hospital Management Board and was an active hospital visitor.,17
10,His charitable works were extensive.,17
11,"He had been President of the Bristol Rotary Club, chairman  of governors of many schools and colleges (notably R.M.C.S., Shrivenham), and was a Liveryman of the Guild of Air Pilots and Navigators, to mention but a few of his activities.",17
12,"He was the perfect committee chairman: he loved committee work when it was productive, and it always was when he was in the chair.",17
13,"Innate within him was the ability to put committee members at their ease, they could give of their best, and he could abstract the maximum amount of information.",17
14,This ability was evident in his many years of A.R.C.,17
15,"Committee and Council chairmanship and in his chairmanship of the university committees, culminating in his Vice-Chancellorship.",17
16,"At one time he was on 25 committees, over and above those within the University, and was chairman of many of these.",17
17,"At the height of this committee and other administrative work, Roderick often expressed his desire to return to his mathematics and, , to write a sequel to his famous book (with R.A. Frazer and W.J. Duncan) Elementary Matrices.",17
18,"I had agreed to be co-author, but it was not until seven years after his retirement that work could begin, for only then had his committee activities abated to an extent which allowed the long periods necessary for writing and discussion.",17
19,"It is appropriate to recall that Elementary Matrices (1938) was printed nine times in U.K., several times in U.S.A., was translated into Russian and Czech, and finally republished in hardback in U.S.A. in 1983.",17
20,"It was written following a period of pioneering work on the application of matrices to engineering problems, undertaken by Frazer, Duncan and Collar at the N.P.L., Teddington, in the 1930s.",17
21,"Collar was certainly the junior member of the partnership, but those who know his mathematical style are well able to perceive his many areas of contribution to the book.",17
22,"In later years, Roderick confided that he had been happy with the title, for the book certainly was not ""elementary"" .",17
23,"Any sequel must be ""more elementary"" and tailored to the needs of the engineering student.",17
24,This is not to be viewed as condescending: Roderick regarded himself as a student of the subject and said so on many occasions during the writing of the new book.,17
25,"As work began in earnest on the book, I realised that Roderick had lost none of the skills that I, as his research student twenty years before, had regarded with awe.",17
26,"But writing now was not easy for him: he had begun to suffer with arthritis in the year following his retirement, and had had to give up his violin lack of flexibility of his fingers, and as the condition developed, he found writing more and more difficult.",17
27,"This did not deter him, as, between 1980 and 1984, he completed over 400 pages of manuscript.",17
28,"On average, we met for three hours every ten days, constantly revising, exchanging and criticising in the end we had both had a hand in everything.",17
29,The whole must have been rewritten about five times.,17
30,Roderick was always seeking a better way of putting things to remove all possible ambiguities and to assist the reader to the maximum extent: if this meant rewriting 100 times he would gladly do it.,17
31,"He was meticulous, but never pedantic.",17
32,"Roderick's last, and possibly finest, contributions to this book were the Theorems XII and XV of Chapter 1 which were completed in 1985 shortly after the serious fall which perhaps precipitated the leukaemia from which he failed to recover, despite repeated blood transfusions.",17
33,"At this stage, the arthritis in his fingers was scarcely bearable and writing extremely painful.",17
34,But the exceptional clarity of his thought processes was evidently still totally unimpaired.,17
35,We last met on the Sunday before his death.,17
36,"Although very weak, he was anxious to discuss technical matters, among which were possible revisions to Chapter 6.",17
37,"He had, a few weeks before, completed an excellent set of autobiographical notes and, characteristically, a sonnet to his wife, Bobbie, on her birthday.",17
38,"Roderick will be sadly missed in every circle in which he moved, but most of all, , by Bobbie, whose devotion and fortitude was his greatest comfort in his final illness, and whose forbearance over many years enabled Roderick to spend such a great amount of valuable time on the book.",17

40,INTRODUCTION,17
41,"In this text, which is aimed at senior undergraduate students of engineering, the subject of matrices is described and developed before being applied to some of the problems of engineering dynamics.",17
42,The matrix theory is presented in classical algebraic form with no recourse to the notions and nomenclature of vector space theory.,17
43,"In this respect, the book is a sequel to the earlier work Elementary Matrices by Frazer, Duncan and Collar, a book which, by presenting problems in a form which could be assimilated by computers, stimulated the growth of the latter.",17
44,"In the present book, the subject is brought up to date and related to modern computer methods.",17
45,"The text is punctuated throughout by numerical examples, most usually based on matrices of small order.",17
46,"The treatment of engineering dynamics is almost invariably linear, although examples of simple non-linear formulations are provided.",17
47,Chapter 1 contains definitions of the basic laws of matrix manipulation and of matrix types.,17
48,Matrix calculus is introduced via the Sylvester expansion theorem and considerable emphasis is placed on the matrix eigenvalue problem.,17
49,A useful collection of theorems and proofs is presented at the end of the chapter: among these is what is thought to be a novel proof of Sylvester's law of degeneracy.,17
50,"Chapter 2 is concerned with numerical methods: it divides into two major parts, namely methods of reciprocation, triangulation and solution of linear algebraic equations, and methods for the solution of eigenvalue problems.",17
51,"Both parts address many alternative procedures, all of which are exemplified — most often by using matrices of order 4.",17
52,"Chapter 3 concerns neighbour systems, a subject of great importance in engineering dynamics.",17
53,"The Collar-Jahn method, several new variants, is presented.",17
54,The difficult problems associated with adjacent or confluent eigenvalues are outlined and methods of solution developed and discussed.,17
55,The chapter is thought to be the first on this subject in a text of this type.,17
56,"Fundamental concepts of dynamical systems are introduced in the simplest of terms, in Chapter 4.",17
57,Formulations based on the principle of virtual work are given emphasis: conservative and non-conservative actions are carefully delineated and discussed in the context of discrete systems.,17
58,The important notion of semi-rigidity is introduced.,17
59,The ideas of Chapter 4 are carried forward in Chapter 5 via a proof of Hamilton's principle and the associated proof of the Lagrange equations.,17
60,Conservative and non-conservative actions are identified by the form of the matrices appearing as coefficient arrays in the equations of motion.,17
61,"A general treatment of the linear conservative dynamical system is given, including calculation of natural frequencies and normal modes, and topics removal of zero frequency roots.",17
62,An outline of structural damping modelling is also given.,17
63,Chapter 6 deals in general terms with the solution of sets of linear differential equations with constant coefficients.,17
64,The concept of the matrix Laplace transform is introduced.,17
65,"In the second part of his chapter, the subject of linear stability theory is discussed, leading from the fundamental encirclement theorem of Cauchy, via the criteria of Leonhard and Routh, to the Poincaré-Liapunov method.",17
66,An inverse method for the calculation of stability boundaries is also discussed.,17
67,Chapter 7 gives an extended treatment of the dynamics problems of continuous linear systems by use of the semi-rigid method in matrix form.,17
68,"Emphasis is placed on one-dimensional systems, but flat plate problems are also discussed.",17
69,"Exact formulations based on ""dynamic stiffness"" or ""receptance"" are highlighted, and the concept of ""finite element"" is introduced as a natural extension of the semi-rigid method.",17
70,"Finally, Chapter 8 deals with the dynamics of composite systems in a manner which owes much to the pioneering work of Kron.",17
71,The finite element and dynamic stiffness methods are introduced and exemplified in simple cases.,17
72,The importance of the connexion graph is emphasised.,17
73,The chapter ends with an extensive discussion of Kron's eigenvalue method followed by proofs of the Wittrick-Williams and Simpson counting algorithms.,17
74,"The book will be accompanied by a ""computational adjunct"" in which a number of BASIC programs for use on home computers will be presented.",17
75,"These programs, which will be available on disc, relate to specific topics covered in the main text and may be used to verify calculations performed therein.",17
76,"Some of the programs, however, are of the general-purpose type.",17
77,Properties of Matrices,17
78,"1.1 ASSUMPTIONS, CONVENTIONS; TRANSPOSITION AND RELATED DEFINITIONS",17
79,In this chapter we shall discuss certain characteristics and properties of matrices which are of particular importance in dynamical studies of systems with multiple degrees of freedom.,17
80,"We assume the reader to be familiar with the notation of matrices and with the rules of combination: addition, multiplication, etc., and with conformability and non-permutability.",17
81,We also assume familiarity with the elementary rules for combination and evaluation of determinants.,17
82,", matrices are rectangular; but of particular importance are matrices having equal numbers of rows and columns — i.e. square matrices — and those having only a single row or column, which we call vectors; both types are special forms of rectangular matrices.",17
83,"Normally, we shall use capital bold type, e.g. A, to denote square and rectangular matrices having two or more rows and columns, and lower case bold type, e.g. x, to denote vectors.",17
84,"If a matrix A has m rows and n columns, i.e. it is of order (m × n), its typical element  lies at the intersection of the ith row and jth column ().",17
85,"If we form the matrix  by writing columns for rows in order, the new matrix, of order (n × m) is called the transpose of A and is denoted by .",17
86,", .",17
87,"The process is clearly one of reflection in the diagonal containing the terms , which is described as the principal diagonal.",17
88,It is of particular importance in square matrices.,17
89,"The terms  in A form the superdiagonal and  the infradiagonal, while for a square matrix of order (n × n)— or more simply, of order n — the elements , form the secondary diagonal.",17
90,An important property of a square matrix is its trace; this is the sum of all the elements in the principal diagonal.,17
91,"Wherever it saves space, we shall always write a column vector x as  the braces{} denote that this is to be read as a column.",17
92,"Since in dynamics, we are usually more often concerned with columns than with rows, we shall write a row vector as the transpose of a column vector, e.g. .",17
93,1.2 SYMMETRIC AND SKEW-SYMMETRIC MATRICES,17
94,"If , the matrices, which are necessarily square, are termed symmetric; if , they are said to be skew-symmetric: in this case, since  = , the principal diagonal has zero elements.",17
95,A square matrix having zeros everywhere except in the principal diagonal is called a diagonal matrix and is clearly symmetric.,17
96,The unit matrix I is a diagonal matrix of unit elements; a matrix having all its elements zero is said to be null and is written 0.,17
97,It is possible to express any square matrix as the sum of a symmetric and a skew-symmetric matrix; this is shown by the identity .,17
98,The first term is unaltered by transposition; the second changes sign.,17
99,1.3 REVERSAL OF ORDER ON TRANSPOSITION,17
100,"If we have a matrix product A = BC, where B is of order (m × r) and C of order (r × n), then A is of order (m × n).",17
101,"If , B and C are conformable only in that order.",17
102,The typical product element is  .,17
103,"Transpose B and C; Then  are of orders (r × m),(n × r) respectively, and are therefore conformable only in the order .",17
104,"Moreover , or .",17
105,Hence transposition of a matrix product requires reversal of the order of the matrices.,17
106,"By an obvious extension, if A = BCD, then , .",17
107,"the formulae (1) and (2) it is clear that these results hold B, C are conformable both in the order BC and in the order CB, including the case where both are square.",17
108,"For the unit and null matrices,(1) implies .",17
109,1.4.,17
110,PARTITIONING OF MATRICES,17
111,"Any matrix may be partitioned, by drawing dotted lines between adjacent columns and adjacent rows, into submatrices.",17
112,"We do this, notionally, in any matrix multiplication: if we are performing the operation BC = A then we isolate a row of B and a column of C — respectively (1 × n) and (n × 1) submatrices — to produce an element — i.e. a (1 × 1) submatrix of A. Similarly, we could, , isolate the first three rows of B and the first four columns of C and multiply these submatrices, of order (3 × n) and (n × 4), to give a (3 × 4) submatrix in the top left corner of A. Again, since  it makes no different if we divide the range, s, of summation into subranges; each subrange can be summed, and these sums added to give the total.",17
113,This is equivalent to vertical partitioning in B with conformable partitioning in C. An example will make this clear.,17
114,"The product BC = A could be  , where B is (4 × 5), C is (5 × 6) and A is (4 × 6).",17
115,"Here B has been partitioned between the second and third rows to give, at the top, a (2 × 5) submatrix (ignore the vertical partition for the moment); C between the fourth and fifth columns to give, on the left, a (5 × 4) submatrix.",17
116,"Multiplied together, these give the (2 × 4) submatrix at the top left in A. The vertical partition in B, after the third column, and the corresponding partition in C, which must be after the third row, merely divide each summation into two parts.",17
117,"Symbolically, we may write the operation as , where the elements  etc are now the above submatrices.",17
118,It is important to note the conformability; thus  is (2 × 2) × (2 × 4) = (2 × 4) also; and  is also (2 × 4).,17
119,"It is evident that, though partitioning is largely arbitrary, conformability both in multiplication and is essential.",17
120,"Partitioning is often of great use, both in analytical manipulation of matrices and in numerical cases, especially when submatrices can be chosen having simple forms, a unit or a null submatrix.",17
121,"1.5 SINGULAR MATRICES, DEGENERACY AND RANK",17
122,"In a square matrix A of order n the array of elements has a determinant  which is nonzero: this implies that the columns (and the rows) are linearly independent, there is no nonzero column vector x Ax vanishes.",17
123,"If, however, a vector x does exist for which Ax = 0, this clearly means that any column of A can be expressed as a linear sum of the remaining columns; by the rules for evaluation of determinants this requires  to be zero.",17
124,"If two different vectors x exist for which Ax = 0, then not only is zero, but also all the minor determinants of order (n — 1) vanish.",17
125,"When , the matrix A is said to be singular.",17
126,"If only one vector x exists for which Ax = 0, A is said to be simply degenerate, or to have simple degeneracy; if one such vector x exists, A has multiple degeneracy.",17
127,"Complementary to the definition of degeneracy is that of rank: for a square matrix, the sum of the degeneracy and rank is the order of the matrix; thus   The rank is in fact the order of the largest nonvanishing minor of , so that rank 0 implies a null matrix.",17
128,"We shall be much concerned in this text with matrices which are simply degenerate (degeneracy 1) and with matrices in which all columns (and all rows) are proportional to ; in the latter case all second-order minors vanish, the rank is 1.",17
129,", for a rectangular matrix, the rank is the number of linearly independent rows (and columns).",17
130,1.6 FACTORISATION OF MATRICES,17
131,"All matrices can be factorised, usually in a variety of ways.",17
132,In the simplest (trivial) case we may write A = AI = IA where I is the conformable unit matrix.,17
133,"Even I itself can be factorised in a variety of ways; as one example, if J is the square matrix which has units in its secondary diagonal and zeros elsewhere, which we shall call the reversing matrix, then ; e.g. for order 3  J is a double factor of I. The ability to factorise a matrix appropriately can often be of great assistance in solving practical problems.",17
134,"Singular matrices can be factorised as the product of two rectangular matrices — again, in more ways than one — the orders of which are determined by the rank of the matrix.",17
135,This may be illustrated by a simple numerical example.,17
136,Let   Inspection shows the third column to be the sum of the first two.,17
137,"Hence if we partition the matrix appropriately,  where the submatrix products are written separately.",17
138,"If now we postmultiply the (3 × 2) submatrix of A by I, we can add the last result to it to recover A as the matrix product  Finally, a matrix of rank 1 can be expressed as the product of a column and a row in that order — for such a matrix has effectively only one independent column, all the other columns being proportional to it; similarly for the rows.",17
139," , any singular matrix of order n and rank r is expressible in an infinite number of ways as the product of two matrices of order (n × r) and (r × n), since r is the number of independent columns (and rows).",17
140,1.7 ADJUGATE AND RECIPROCAL MATRICES,17
141,"If  is a square matrix of order n, and if, in the determinant , the element  has the cofactor  (, the value of the determinant obtained from  by deleting the ith row and jth column, leaving a minor of order (n — 1) which is then multiplied by , then by the rules for evaluation of determinants  while   since the summation in the latter result gives the value of a determinant having two equal rows.",17
142,"It follows that if the cofactors  are arranged as a matrix  of order n, then  where, to conform with matrix multiplication rules, we must use the transpose of  to postmultiply A. If a row summation as in (1) we use column summation, we find also  A and  are permutable.",17
143,"The matrix  is called the adjugate of A. If A is singular,  vanishes, then  In this case, if A is simply degenerate,  is of rank 1; but if A is multiply degenerate, all the cofactors of Aij vanish for all i, j, then  is null.",17
144,"These results are examples of Sylvester's law of degeneracy (see Theorem XII of 1.22), viz. the degeneracy of the product of two matrices is as great as the degeneracy of either factor, and as great as the sum of the degeneracies of the factors.",17
145,"When , we may divide  by , calling the result R. then AR = I, and R can be described as the reciprocal or the inverse of A. We have already seen that it permutes with A; however, this is readily proved alternatively.",17
146,"Let  from the latter, postmultiplying by R1, we have R2AR = R1, and using the former, R2 = R1.",17
147,"Moreover, the reciprocal is unique; for if AR1 = I and AR2 = I, then A (R1 — R2) = 0, and on premultiplication by R1 we have R1 = R2.",17
148,"In conformity with usual algebraic notation, the reciprocal of A is written  a separate symbol is unnecessary.",17
149,Thus  expresses the essential property of the reciprocal of A.,17
150,"Just as with transposition, if a matrix product is inverted the order of the factors must be reversed.",17
151,"Let A = BCD, where the matrices are all square and non-singular.",17
152,"By premultiplication or  postmultiplication as required, we have successively ",17
153,"1.8 POWERS OF MATRICES, POLYNOMIALS AND SERIES",17
154,We have just established the existence of a negative power of a square non-singular matrix.,17
155,", any square matrix can be raised to any positive integral power by continued multiplication, in any order, by itself.",17
156,"Any such powers are evidently permutable;  Similarly, any power of a matrix may itself be raised to a power;  while if A is non-singular  Evidently, the index laws of ordinary algebra apply.",17
157,",  where A is non-singular; in fact  applies for all square matrices.",17
158,"Just as we can have polynomials involving powers of a scalar quantity{ gl}, e.g.  so we can have polynomials of a square matrix A:  where the  are scalar multipliers.",17
159,Polynomials of matrices are of great importance in a variety of ways.,17
160,", suppose we can find a set of multipliers pi P(A) vanishes.",17
161,"Then, if  exists, we may premultiply or postmultiply P(A) by  to obtain  as a convenient formula for computing .",17
162,We can also define matrix series; the parallel series  exp A converges in exactly the same way as exp{ gl}.,17
163,"In parallel with the scalar series, exp (-A) is the reciprocal of exp A.  If, as in (2) and (3), we have a polynomial or series in a scalar quantity{ gl}and the corresponding function in the square matrix A, we may multiply the scalar function by I to obtain the two matrix functions  Subtraction term by term then gives  where Q is a function we need not evaluate here.",17
164,"The matrix  is of very great importance, not only in studies of the intrinsic properties of A, but also in dynamical and other applications it is called the characteristic matrix of A.",17
165,1.9 SPECIAL TYPES OF MATRIX,17
166,"We have already defined symmetric, skew-symmetric, diagonal, unit and null matrices.",17
167,We now summarise and extend these definitions.,17
168,(1) Symmetric matrix — characterised by A = AT.,17
169,(2) Skew-symmetric matrix — characterised by A = — AT.,17
170,(3) Diagonal matrix — characterised by .,17
171,We now establish an important property of diagonal matrices.,17
172,Let C be any square matrix and D a conformable diagonal matrix with diagonal elements .,17
173,"Then postmultiplication of C by D multiplies the columns of C in order by , etc., while premultiplication of C by D multiplies the rows of C in order by , etc.",17
174,"Thus, the typical element of CD is  while that of DC is .",17
175,"It follows that if C and D permute, DC = CD, then  if .",17
176,"For a diagonal matrix D having all its diagonal elements different, it follows that C must then also be diagonal.",17
177,"If D has some equal diagonal elements, then C can possess nonzero off-diagonal elements in a ""diagonal submatrix"" corresponding to the equal elements of D.",17
178,", if  which we write as D = Diag(1,2,3), and   then if C and D are to permute we must have  d = e = f = g = h = k = 0, leaving C = Diag (a, b, c).",17
179,"However, if D = Diag(1,2,3) we have that  e = g = h = k = 0 leaving  which we may write as Block Diag  where  Finally, we note that if  for all i, then .",17
180,This follows from the identity .,17
181,"(4) Unit matrix — this is the diagonal matrix with units in the diagonal positions; it is written I. (5) Scalar matrix — this is the diagonal matrix with the same scalar quantity, say , in the diagonal positions.",17
182,Evidently such a matrix may be written ; multiplication by a scalar matrix therefore implies multiplication by a scalar quantity.,17
183,(6) Reversing matrix — this is the square matrix having units in its secondary diagonal and zeros elsewhere; it is written J. Postmultiplication of any matrix C by the conformable J matrix reverses the order of the columns of C while premultiplication by J reverses the order of the rows.,17
184,(7) Null matrix — this has zero elements throughout.,17
185,"(8) Triangular matrices — these are of two types: lower triangular, L, and upper triangular, U. L is characterised by a typical element having the property  while U is characterised by .",17
186,"Thus,  are, respectively, lower and upper triangular matrices.",17
187,An obvious and useful property of triangular matrices is that their determinants are simply the products of their diagonal terms.,17
188,"Thus, in the above example,  Another useful property of triangular matrices is the ease with which their reciprocals may be calculated.",17
189,", if R = (Rij) is the reciprocal of a lower triangular matrix L then  where a, b, c,…must be nonzero; otherwise  and R does not exist.",17
190,"The first row of the product gives  and this, the second row, excluding its first element, gives  .",17
191,"Accordingly, R is also lower triangular, and its diagonal elements are , as is otherwise obvious from consideration of the cofactors of a, b, c,…in L. Hence a computer program to find R needs to calculate only the n (n — 2) /2 elements below the diagonal; and these are found progressively.",17
192," gives, from the first column,  and from the second column,   Transposition of the above shows that the reciprocal of an upper triangular matrix U is itself upper triangular, and that its diagonal elements are the reciprocals of those of U.",17
193,(9) Persymmetric matrix — this is a square matrix in which the elements in any line parallel to the secondary diagonal are equal.,17
194,"Thus, if A is persymmetric, it is characterised by the typical element  and hence has, , 2n — 1 independent elements.",17
195,", the matrix  is persymmetric. (10) Centrosymmetric and centroskew matrices — a matrix which is symmetric about the centre point of its array is said to be centrosymmetric; thus, if A is centrosymmetric, of order n, it is characterised by  More simply, if J is the reversing matrix, a centrosymmetric matrix has the property A = JAJ A centroskew matrix is characterised by the equation A = JAJ.",17
196,", the matrices  are centrosymmetric, while the matrices  are centroskew.",17
197,Centrosymmetric matrices and centroskew vectors arise in the study of the dynamics of mechanical systems having physical symmetry (e.g. a suspension bridge).,17
198,"(11) Orthogonal matrices — a square, non-singular matrix A having the property  is said to be orthogonal.",17
199,Orthogonal matrices are of very great importance in dynamics.,17
200,", the matrix  is orthogonal, since  It should be noted that the determinant of the above orthogonal matrix is unity: an orthogonal matrix will have  as its determinant since  (12) Hermitian and skew-Hermitian matrices — if a matrix, A, has complex elements, it can clearly be written in the form  where B and C are real matrices and  is the conjugate of A. If B is symmetric and C is skew-symmetric, A is said to be Hermitian.",17

208,"1.10 VARIABLE MATRICES, LINEAR SUBSTITUTIONS AND ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS",17
209,"So far, we have discussed the properties of matrices, and the algebra of matrices, in general terms, and without reference to the nature of the elements: where illustrations have been given we have used arithmetical numbers for elements.",17
210,But the elements can be variables.,17
211,"They may, , all be functions of time, we must write A = A(t); they may be functions of a parameter, typified by  when the elements are rational integral functions of{ gl}, the matrix is called a lambda-matrix; or the elements may themselves (especially for vectors) be independent variables.",17
212,"Finally, when sets of differential equations are written in matrix form, some of the matrices will be, in effect, operators.",17
213,We now proceed to examine some simple cases.,17
214,"Suppose first that we have a set of variables  related to a second set  by an equation of the type y = Ax; such a relation might, , connect the coordinates, referred to two different sets of axes, of a point moving in n-space.",17
215,Such a relation is called liner substitution.,17
216,"its intrinsic importance, it is of interest since the subject of matrices evolved from it.",17
217,"Cayley took a set of equations  and enclosed each side in brackets, two equal columns could be connected by a single equality sign.",17
218,"He then extracted the vector x and wrote it vertically as a parallel to y, so requiring the row-by-column rule for multiplication.",17
219,"A second substitution of the same kind, such as z = By.",17
220,"implies z = By = BAx, BA is the matrix converting x into z.",17
221,"If the values of x are unknown, but y is given (say y = b) then we have a set of linear algebraic equations for x: Ax = b, of which the formal solution is : however, various well known methods exist for finding x without computing  (see 2.5).",17
222,"As a very simple example of a linear substitution, consider the coordinates of a point P two sets of axes  mutually inclined at an angle  Evidently  elimination of r,  gives   and it should be noted that in this case the matrix of transformation is orthogonal.",17
223,The formal solution  (3) assumes that A is non-singular.,17
224,"Suppose, however, that A has degeneracy s.",17
225,"Then s of the rows implicit in (3) may be compounded from the remaining n — s rows, and so provide no extra information.",17
226,"These s rows, including the appropriate elements of b, may thus be discarded.",17
227,"We are left with n — s rows which may be written in partitioned matrix form as  where A1 is a non-singular submatrix of A of order (n — s)(some reordering of the elements of x may be necessary to obtain the non-singular minor),  is of the order  and c is the reduced vector b; x has been partitioned conformably into n — s elements (y) and s elements (z).",17
228,"We may write this equation as  Equation (5) is known as a parametric solution: since we have only n — s independent relations we can determine only n — s unknowns (y) the remaining s quantities (z), which may be regarded as arbitrary parameters in the problem.",17
229,1.11 BILINEAR AND QUADRATIC FORMS,17
230,"Scalar functions often arise which are linear and homogeneous in two sets of variables x1,…, xn and y1,…, ym.",17
231,"By inspection, it is evident that such a function may be written as  when x, y are written as columns.",17
232,"Here A, of order (m × n) is called the matrix of the form.",17
233,"Suppose we wish to express f new variables , where  then   is the matrix of the new form.",17
234,We say hat A and  are connected by an equivalent transformation.,17
235,"If the elements of x, y are independent variables, we may differentiate them.",17
236,", from (1) above,  is the first element in the column Ax,  the second, etc.,  In this text, we shall be more concerned with quadratic forms, obtained from bilinear forms  when y = x,  where A is now necessarily square.",17
237,"Moreover, although in the formulation of A the elements Aij and Aji may not be equal, we may note that (see 1.2)  and on transposition it follows that  A may be replaced by its symmetric equivalent ; we now assume that A is symmetric.",17
238,Then if we form  we have  since transposition of the second term repeats the first.,17
239,"Thus, since  If we express a quadratic form  another set of variables y given by the linear substitution x = By, then  where  and we observe that C, like A, is symmetric.",17
240,"A transformation of type (2), in which A, C need not be symmetric, but in which B is square and non-singular, is described as a congruent transformation and is of particular importance in dynamics.",17
241,"A quadratic form  and the matrix A within f, are said to be positive definite (pos. def.) if  for all real, non-null vectors x.",17
242,We may construct a table for such definitions (Table 1).,17

245,"If a skew-symmetric, transposition shows that  vanishes.",17
246,1.12 EQUIVALENT MATRICES AND CANONICAL FORMS,17
247,"We have just defined the general equivalent transformation, and this leads naturally to the important concept of equivalent matrices.",17
248,We approach this by considering the elementary operations which are commonly used in the condensation of determinants.,17
249,Let I  be the unit matrix with its ith and jth rows interchanged.,17
250,"The new matrix is symmetric, since both its i, jth and j, ith elements are unity; moreover, its determinant is -1, since in moving the jth row to the ith position  we cross j — i rows; but the original ith row is now the i + 1th and so in taking it to the jth position we cross j — i — 1 rows.",17
251,its symmetry  can equally be obtained by interchange of the ith and jth columns rows.,17
252,Let us restrict ourselves to square matrices; then premultiplication of any matrix A by  has the effect of interchanging the ith and jth rows of A; postmultiplication of A by  interchanges the ith and jth columns.,17
253,"Next, let  be the unit matrix with the addition of an element k in the  position.",17
254,Then premultiplication of A by  has the effect of adding k times the jth row of A to the ith row; similarly the operation AI(kij) has the effect of adding k times the ith column of A to the jth column.,17
255,The determinant of  is clearly unity.,17
256,"Finally, let  be the unit matrix with the element  substituted for the unit in the i, ith position.",17
257,Then I(li)A multiplies the ith row of A by l; A multiplies the ith column of A by l.,17
258,"This operation is evidently an extension of the I operation; adding multiples of a different row (or column) to a given row, it adds multiples of the same row; however, it differs in that now the determinant is l.",17
259,"The reciprocal of I is I itself, since a double interchange of two rows restores the original matrix; the reciprocal of I is also evidently I and that of .",17
260,Any product of these various matrices is always non-singular.,17
261,"Two matrices, A, B are said to be equivalent if one can be derived from the other by any finite number of elementary operations of the types specified above.",17
262,"Hence, if all the premultiplications and postmultiplications are grouped together to form (non-singular) matrices P and Q respectively, and A, B are equivalent, then B = PAQ and  Since k, l are arbitrary () it follows that there is a infinite number of matrices B equivalent to A. However, there is one matrix which is of especially simple form; it is described as the canonical form of A.",17
263,"First, let us suppose that A is non-singular.",17
264,"If A11 = 0 we can bring any non-zero element to the A11 position by the use of I we can then reduce this element to unity by the use of I(l), and then reduce all the remaining elements of the first row and the first column to zero using I(k).",17
265,"We do the same for the submatrix bordered by the first row and column, , finally we reach the unit matrix as the canonical form for A. It is to be observed that, since in using elementary operations I (i, j), I(k), I(l) on A we are effectively at each stage multiplying together determinants neither of which vanishes, the reduction of A to I must be possible when A is on-singular.",17
266,"In passing, we may note that, since PAQ = I, ",17
267,"Now suppose A to be singular, of rank r and order n.",17
268,"This means that all minor determinants of order r + 1 vanish, but one minor of order r is not zero.",17
269,"None of the operations I (i, j), I(k), I(l), they affect the minors, can make a minor of order r + 1 nonzero, nor make the minor of order r vanish, since they merely condense these minors.",17
270,We may therefore use the processes above a non-singular matrix; we achieve a series of units in the positions; the other elements in the matrix are all zero.,17
271,The canonical form of A is thus  where I is of order r.,17
272,"If B = PAQ, where P, Q are non-singular but otherwise arbitrary, then the canonical forms for P, Q are the unit matrix.",17
273,"It follows that P, Q can be constructed from I by elementary operations; accordingly, if any such product, provided only that P, Q are non-singular, A and B are equivalent matrices; and , they will have the same rank.",17
274,1.13 LAMBDA-MATRICES,17
275,We have already defined a lambda-matrix of which the elements are rational integral functions of some parameter  Such matrices arise in many problems of mechanics.,17
276,", suppose we have a pair of simultaneous differential equations  where the coefficients  are constants.",17
277,We can write these as  where the column matrices are all functions of time.,17
278,An alternative symbolic formulation would be  where D = d/dt and the square matrix is now an operator on x.,17
279,"Finally, if we are seeking the complementary function of the equations, we write x proportional to exp  and obtain  as the equations determining  and the ratio  In abbreviated form this can be written .",17
280,The equation determining  is obtained from the vanishing of the determinant of the lambda-matrix; it is evidently a quartic in  and each of the four roots will have its own associated vector x.,17
281,"While it is often convenient to deal with equations (2) in the way indicated, it is also often useful to transform them into first-order equations.",17
282,"This may be done in various ways, but one simple and useful device is to adopt two auxiliary variables:  and to write the equations in the form  Then if we now write  and  proportional to exp  and again seek the complementary function, the four equations may be written, with a little rearrangement,  This equation can clearly be written in partitioned form as  or  where  The quartic determinantal equation obtained from this first-order set of equations may be seen by inspection to be identical with that obtained from the quadratic formulation.",17
283,"A matrix of the form M +  is called a matrix pencil (see 2.9, 2.10).",17
284,1.14 ADJUGATE LAMBDA-MATRICES,17
285,"If A  is a lambda-matrix, its elements are rational integral functions of{ gl}and so also, therefore, are the cofactors{ ga}of the elements of A: hence the adjugate,  of A is also a lambda-matrix, and   We shall denote the determinant  by .",17
286,"The reciprocal of A, however, being  divided by  is not a lambda-matrix, unless it should happen that  is independent of .",17
287,1.15 EQUIVALENT LAMBDA-MATRICES,17
288,"If we have an equivalent transformation  where P, Q may be constructed by any of the elementary operations defined in 2.12, then B and A are equivalent.",17
289,"It should be noted that the determinants of P, Q must be non-vanishing constants, though  may appear in them.",17
290,"This implies that in an operation I(k) we may see I( ),; but  will not appear in I(l) operations, except in a self-cancelling form, e.g. we could use I(l) with  in the ith place, following with I(l) with  in the jith place, the product of the two steps has unit determinant.",17
291,"I (i, j) is, , independent of .",17
292,"Using elementary operations of this kind, we may construct a canonical form of lambda-matrices, which is diagonal, the elements in the diagonal being functions of .",17
293,The canonical form is not unique; the best-known form is that Smith (see Ref. (1)).,17
294,"If C( ); is the canonical form, since C{ () = PA( )Q; we have  and since  are non-vanishing constants, we have that  and  differ only by a scalar multiplier.",17
295,Hence the roots of  are identical with those of .,17
296,1.16 THE CHARACTERISTIC MATRIX AND ITS EIGENVALUES,17
297,"Suppose we have a linear substitution Ax = y in which it is required that y be a scalar multiple of x, say x.",17
298,Then x — Ax = (I — A) x = 0.,17
299,"Then the square lambda-matrix (I — A), which is the characteristic matrix of A (see 1.8), must be singular; i.e. the determinant  if x is not to vanish.",17
300,This important equation is called the characteristic equation.,17
301,"If A (which is necessarily square) is of order n, then clearly the characteristic equation may be written   The n roots of this equation, say  are called eigenvalues.",17
302,"In what follows, we shall now regard 1,…, n as all different.",17
303,"An alternative formulation of the characteristic function is evidently  and it is to be observed that the two formulations imply, ,  and  where Theorems II and III of 1.22 have been used.",17
304,"Let us write  then from (4),  if we regard 1 as typical of all the roots,  since all the roots differ.",17
305,"Now by the usual rule for differentiation of determinants,  is linear and homogeneous in the first minors of{ gd}().",17
306,"Since, typically,  it follows that not all the first minors of  vanish, it is simply degenerate.",17
307,"For the same reason , the adjugate, is not null, and so has unit rank, as shown below.",17
308,"Since  vanishes but one first minor does not, there must be n — 1 independent columns, the remaining column being expressible uniquely the independent columns.",17
309,"This means that there will be a vector x1, called an eigenvector,  and x1 is uniquely determined, an arbitrary scalar multiplier; , the ratios of the elements of x1 to are uniquely determined.",17
310,"Similarly, a scalar multiplier, there will be a unique row vector   It is readily shown that the adjugate  is proportional to the unit rank product .",17
311,"For suppose ; then  Postmultiply this by any column p the scalar product ; then  Since the vector x1 is unique to a scalar multiplier, we may identify  with x1 and similarly  with .",17
312,"If we revert to the original problem, the solution of Ax = x, we now see that there are just n eigenvalues s and that correspondingly there are just n vectors xs; i.e. we have n equations  We can combine them all into the single equation  or more briefly AX = X where X is ow the square matrix made up of the n column vectors xs, and  is the diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues; and our problem is now to find the matrices X and  for the given A.",17
313,We may not one further point.,17
314,Let d be an arbitrary diagonal matrix; then it will permute with the diagonal matrix  Postmultiply (7) by d; then  showing that Xd is a solution of (7).,17
315,"This expresses the fact that the columns of X are each arbitrary to a scalar multiplier, since in Xd, x1 is multiplied by the scalar d1 .",17
316,"If (7) is premultiplied by A, we have A(AX) = (AX)  and AX is apparently an alternative solution for X. But since AX = X{gd} it is X postmultiplied by a diagonal matrix, as before, here the diagonal matrix is not arbitrary.",17
317,The matrix equation   arises perhaps most commonly in the study of the natural frequencies and modes of vibration of an undamped mechanical system having n degrees of freedom.,17
318,"The matrix A derives from the mechanical properties (mass and stiffness) of the system; s then determines the square of a natural frequency, and xs the corresponding mode of distortion.",17
319,"However, the amplitude is not determined; xs is arbitrary to a scalar multiplier.",17
320,In this sense an arbitrary multiplier ds can be regarded as an amplitude.,17
321,"its importance in vibration problems, the matrix X, which is the array of the individual eigenvectors xs, is usually spoken of as the modal matrix, the problem from which it derives is not a dynamical one.",17
322,Similarly{ gd}in vibration problems is a diagonal matrix of squares of natural frequencies and thus defines the frequency spectrum of the system; accordingly it is referred to generally as the spectral matrix.,17
323,"We may readily show that the matrix X is non-singular. for if it is not, let us first suppose it to be simply degenerate.",17
324,"Then there will be a vector p, unique a scalar factor, Xp = 0.",17
325,"But in that case premultiplication by A gives 0 = AXp = Xp p provides a relation different from p between the columns of X, which is impossible.",17
326,"Similarly, if X were doubly degenerate we could have only two vectors p satisfying Xp = 0, but each of these would give rise to other different vectors p.",17
327,Hence X is non-singular.,17
328,"We may accordingly write (7) as  and A,  are equivalent matrices.",17

335,1.17 THE CAYLEY-HAMILTON THEOREM,17
336,This important theorem states that any square matrix A satisfies its own characteristic equation.,17
337,"First, suppose as above that the eigenvalues are all distinct; then (1.16.9) we may write the polynomial  (A) as  Now the diagonal matrix  has for diagonal elements  all of which vanish; i.e.  is null.",17

339,The equation is true the eigenvalues are not all different.,17
340,For we know that  where  is the adjugate of (I — A).,17
341,"Since both  and{ gd}() I are lambda-matrices, we amy write them as polynomials in  with matrix coefficients; let us write the equation as  Then on multiplying out and identifying coefficients of , we have   Premultiply the first of these relations by , the second by , etc. and add: the result is  (A) = 0.",17
342,"Equations (1.16.3) and (1.16.4) show that the characteristic equation may be written in the alternative forms  It follows that the Cayley-Hamilton theorem  can be written in the alternative form, in which for consistency each factor has been multiplied by -1,  It will be observed that, with eigenvalues all different, each of these matrices has degeneracy 1, the product of all n factors having degeneracy n: i.e. it is null; this is an illustration of Sylvester's law of degeneracy (Theorem XII of 1.22).",17
343,"Since  (A) vanishes, so also do , etc. it follows that any power n or more of A, or any polynomial degree of n or more in A, can be expressed as a polynomial in A of degree n — 1.",17
344,"Furthermore, if A is non-singular,  may be expressed as a polynomial of degree n — 1 in A, and therefore also  and higher negative powers.",17
345,Examples of the utility of this theorem will appear later.,17
346,1.18 SYLVESTER'S EXPANSION THEOREM,17
347,"We revert to Equation (1.16.9) and write , to conform with the notation for the adjugate of X. Then  Now P(A) is the diagonal matrix of which the diagonal elements are  in succession.",17
348,we here assume the eigenvalues s to be all different.,17
349,We now write   each square matrix is null a unit in the appropriate diagonal position.,17
350,"the isolating vector ei this may be written  and if P(A) is expanded in this way, the first term, which is typical will be  The square matrices on the right of these equations are all of unit rank; we may write the last as  where x1 is the first column of X, and  the first row of .",17
351,"We thus establish Sylvester's theorem for the expansion of P(A), viz.  where  The unit rank matrices  which are known as the constituent matrices of A, have interesting and important properties.",17
352,"Thus:(i) As has been noted earlier, in 1.16  is proportional to , where  is the adjugate of (I — A).",17
353,"(ii) We defined  as , hence  This equation requires, for all the rows  and columns   Hence  since the inner product (scalar) is unit.",17
354,"Hence  this property,  is said to be idempotent. (iii) We have also  since the inner product vanishes.",17
355,"(iv) If in Sylvester's expansion we put P(A), which is a arbitrary polynomial, equal to I, , then  As a simple example of the consistency of the theorem, let us write Sylvester's expansion for A as  Let us square both sides; then  and the properties above  Sylvester's theorem.",17
356,1.19 ORTHOGONALITY AND BI-ORTHOGONALITY OF THE MODAL MATRIX,17
357,"We consider first the eigenvalues (supposed all different) and modal matrix of a symmetric matrix A. then by (1.16.7) AX = X and on premultiplication  Transpose this; then since  we obtain  Comparison of (1) and (2) shows that   permutes with , a diagonal matrix with all its diagonal elements different.",17
358,Hence (see 1.9)  must also be diagonal and it then follows that  is also diagonal.,17
359,"Now we have seen that we can use Xd X, where d is an arbitrary diagonal matrix; and it therefore follows that  is also diagonal.",17
360,Now the ith diagonal element of this product is  and we may clearly choose di to make this element unity.,17
361,"If this is done for all i, and we write Xn for Xd, then  the modal matrix Xn, chosen in this way, is orthogonal and we say that Xn is the normalised for of the modal matrix.",17
362,"Next consider the more general case when A is not symmetric, but is expressed as the product of two symmetric factors.",17
363,"Such factorisation is always possible, in a number of ways; , since AX = XA then  A has been factorised into two symmetric matrices; however, this particular factorisation presupposes a knowledge of X and .",17
364,"Suppose instead that we can write A as  where B, C are symmetric; then we have  or BX = CX.",17
365,Dynamical problems frequently arise in this form directly.,17
366,"Now as before, if we premultiply by  and transpose, since  and    permutes with  and is thus diagonal, whence it follows that  is diagonal also.",17
367,Clearly we cannot normalise X in this case to make both  and  unit matrices; we say therefore that in this case X is bi-orthogonal or has a generalised orthogonal form.,17
368,"We may pursue the matter further, however.",17
369,"If as previously we write Xd for X, where d is an arbitrary diagonal matrix, then we obtain  as diagonal matrices.",17
370,Now the ith diagonal element of    where the bracketed term is the quadratic form obtained from C with the ith eigenvector xi.,17
371,"This quadratic form is not, as previously, a sum of squares; but provided it is not zero we could choose di to make the element unity, when we should have (with X for Xd)  the properties established here, it is usual to say that the modes of a system are orthogonal to .",17
372,1.20 CANONICAL FORMS OBTAINED BY SIMILAR TRANSFORMATION,17
373,"We consider a matrix A, which for the moment we regard as having distinct eigenvalues.",17
374,"We have seen (1.12) that by elementary operations we can perform an equivalent transformation C = PAQ and C has a special canonical form, either the unit matrix or containing a diagonal unit submatrix.",17
375,"Let us now impose the restriction that whenever we perform an elementary postmultiplying operation to make up Q, we premultiply by the inverse operation to make up P, .",17
376,"In this case, we cannot reduce C to a diagonal matrix of units, since evidently .",17
377,"However, a simple and powerful canonical form is obtainable.",17
378,The matrix A has the characteristic matrix (I — A).,17
379,"If this is premultiplied by  and postmultiplied by Q, then  A and  have the same eigenvalues.",17
380,", if we identify Q with the modal matrix X, then  by (1.16.8).",17
381,"Hence, as is otherwise obvious from the derivation of (1.16.8), the eigenvalues of A are given directly by , etc.",17
382,"In this case, therefore, we may regard  as the simple canonical form for a matrix having distinct eigenvalues.",17
383,"Note that if  and  then  , if X is the modal matrix of A, QX is the modal matrix of B.",17
384,"The great majority of mechanical problems give rise to matrices having distinct eigenvalues; however, problems involving equal eigenvalues are unknown.",17
385,", a rigid body may have some of its motions constrained by springs, but two (or more) unconstrained; it will then have two (or more) equal zero frequencies.",17
386,"The canonical form obtained by a similar transformation of a matrix having equal eigenvalues, when reduced to its simplest form, has the eigenvalues in the principal diagonal, with equal eigenvalues in groups; elsewhere the matrix is null there may be units in the superdiagonal.",17
387,"Thus, , a matrix of order 6 having three equal eigenvalues{ ga}, two equal eigenvalues{ gb}, and an unrepeated eigenvalue{ gg}, would have as its canonical form  where each x may be zero or unity; it occurs only within the submatrices containing groups of equal eigenvalues.",17
388,C is sometimes called the Jordan canonical form and a submatrix  is known as a Jordan block.,17
389,"If in C a unit occurs at a position x, it cannot be removed by a similar transformation.",17
390,This is readily proved as follows.,17
391,"Suppose we wish to remove the unit from the superdiagonal in the matrix   a similar transformation; we can write the most general transformation matrix as  Then  and if both off-diagonal elements are to vanish, then  Provided  we may satisfy (4) and : , if we choose .",17
392,"Then  However, if  then the only solution of(4) is c = d = 0 when ad — bc vanishes,  does not exist.",17
393,"Hence, if a unit exists (it may not) in the superdiagonal element two equal eigenvalues, it cannot be removed by a similar transformation.",17
394,The reason for the existence or absence of a unit in the superdiagonal is easy to see.,17
395,"Suppose C in (3) is derived by a similar transformation from a matrix A, to which it is therefore equivalent.",17
396,"Then if I-A is simply degenerate when  ={ga}so also is I — C. There must in consequence be two units in the top two places of the superdiagonal, for without them I — C would have three null rows and three null columns, and so be triply degenerate.",17
397,"With two units present, only the first column and third row are null, I — C is simply degenerate as required.",17
398,Evidently the introduction of a unit reduces the degeneracy of I — C by unity.,17
399,"It is clear from the derivation of the canonical form that it is conventional, but not necessary, to put equal eigenvalues in groups, and to put units in the superdiagonal.",17
400,"In a practical case, we might find an intermediate form for the matrix C of (3) to be (we shall discuss the meaning of x and y)   Now suppose , and therefore  to be simply degenerate when  Then  must also be simply degenerate.",17
401,"This requires that either x or y is nonzero, the other being zero; only so does the matrix have only one null column and row.",17

409,1.21 SOME REMARKS ON EQUAL EIGENVALUES,17
410,"We have already remarked that the case of equal or confluent eigenvalues is not common in practical dynamical problems; however, when it occurs, it can cause difficulties.",17
411,We shall not attempt to deal with the full problem of multiple equal eigenvalues; it will be sufficient to consider the case of two equal roots 1 = 2 as typical.,17
412,"Extension to more complicated cases is not difficult (a) Extension of the Cayley-Hamilton theorem In 1.17 we showed that a matrix A satisfies its own characteristic equation, i.e.  the nature of the eigenvalues.",17
413,"Now when , the characteristic matrix (I — A) may be simply or doubly  degenerate, the nature of its canonical form  If it is simply degenerate (i.e. its canonical form includes a unit in the superdiagonal) then  (A) = 0 is in fact the vanishing polynomial in A of lowest degree.",17
414,"But if it is doubly degenerate, there is a reduced characteristic equation  being one degree lower than .",17
415,"Consider the equation  where  is the adjugate of ( if for  ( is doubly degenerate  is null, since all first minors of (I — A) vanish.",17
416,"Accordingly,  must have the factor ( —  in each element, while  () has two such factors.",17
417,"If we cancel one factor from both sides, we can write  and then, as before, we can prove that .",17
418,"An alternative expression is evidently  where the first factor is doubly degenerate; the remainder are simply degenerate, giving as before a total degeneracy n.",17
419,"But if the first factor is simply degenerate, it must appear twice.",17
420,We may illustrate this with a simple numerical case.,17
421,Let  Put  = 2 and  in the characteristic matrix  then  since by inspection it is doubly degenerate.,17
422,"Also   which is simply degenerate; the sum of the columns vanishes, but first minors do not.",17
423,By inspection  satisfying the reduced characteristic equation.,17
424,"However, when we put   in the characteristic matrix , we obtain  both of which are simply degenerate; it is readily checked that  which satisfies the full characteristic equation.",17
425,"If a reduced characteristic equation exists, , then …also vanish; and, as in 1.1, we may now express powers of A or polynomials in A as polynomials in A of degree one less than that of .",17
426,"(b) Nature of modal matrix We now turn to the confluent form of Equation (1.16.7), viz. AX = XA, and we shall deal with this by using the example of the numerical matrices A and B above.",17
427,"By inspection of (3) we can see that a column vector xi postmultiplying (2I — A) to give a null result must be such that  vanishes; two obvious vectors achieving this are{ 1,2,4) and{ 1,0,— 1}.",17
428,"Also if (I — A) is postmultiplied by{ 1,1,1}it vanishes.",17
429,"Hence we may write (8) as  , in this case (two equal roots and double degeneracy of the characteristic matrix), the form of (8) is unaltered.",17
430,"However, it should be noted that, while the first two columns of X are arbitrary to a scalar multiplier, they are also obviously arbitrary to any linear combination; i.e. we may postmultiply the equation by a matrix   in which  and  are arbitrary D must be non-singular.",17
431,"The leading second-order submatrix of D corresponds to the scalar submatrix in A and therefore permutes with it, as before  and XD is a solution of (8).",17
432,"Now consider the matrix B, which yields two equal eigenvalues but simple degeneracy.",17
433,"Since 2I — B and I — B are both simply degenerate we can find only one vector for each to satisfy ; they are respectively (see (6)){1,2,4}and{ 1.1.1}.",17
434,No other vector (scalar multiplies) satisfies the equation.,17
435,It follows that we cannot make up a square matrix X of eigenvectors to satisfy (8); for this reason the matrix B is said to be defective.,17
436,"However, we may note that{ 1.2.4}and{ 1.1.1}are the first and third columns of the modal matrix X appropriate to A. If we try this X for B we find that we obtain L or  where  is now the diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues with the addition of a unit in the top superdiagonal place.",17
437,"Evidently A is the canonical form of A, and  that of the defective matrix B. In this latter case, a postmultiplying non-singular matrix analogous to(9) which will permute with  is  where  and  are otherwise arbitrary.",17
438,Then  satisfies (10).,17
439,"We may note that, for both the matrices A and B,  we may therefore construct the canonical forms directly from   We now revert to (10); if for convenience we denote the columns of X by  respectively, then as we have said above, only x1 and x3 are eigenvectors; they make  and  vanish, and are each unique to a scalar multiplier.",17
440,"We now examine the origins of , which B we call an auxiliary vector.",17
441,"In (10) we find  Premultiplication of this by (2I — B) yields  Accordingly, postmultiplication by the auxiliary vector  annihilates , in fact, since  is doubly degenerate, there will be two linearly independent postmultiplying vectors which annihilate it, separately or in linear combinations.",17
442,"We can, and indeed must, choose x1 as one of these, for sine  vanishes, so evidently does ; and then  is the other.",17
443,We might have anticipated this result from Equations (5) and (7).,17
444,I (5) the doubly degenerate matrix (2I -A) is annihilated by two linearly independent eigenvectors and the simply degenerate (I — A) by the third.,17
445,"In (7),  is doubly degenerate and so corresponds with (2I — A); however, in this case one eigenvector and one auxiliary vector emerge.",17
446,"It is now clear that, to make up X, we require (i) an eigenvector x1 satisfying  (ii) an auxiliary vector  satisfying  (iii) an eigenvector x3 satisfying  In the numerical example (10),  and postmultiplication by x1 ={1,2,4}makes both vanish; postmultiplication by  ={1,0, -1}annihilates the second but not the first; the product yields — x1.",17
447,"There is one further point of importance:  is not unique, but contains an arbitrary element.",17
448,"As we have seen,  is satisfied by two linearly independent vectors (in our example,{1,2,4}and{ 1,0, -1}and therefore by any linear combinations of them.",17
449,"One is chosen to be x1, satisfying (2I — B) x = 0; the other , is another arbitrary combination.",17
450,"However, it must satisfy  if x1 is multiplied by a scalar d1 so also is ; which is why (11) contains  equal elements .",17
451,But the equation is also satisfied by  in our example  with  arbitrary.,17
452,This result is evidently generally true.,17
453,"As a dynamical example, perhaps the commonest practical problem leading to a double eigenvalue with simple degeneracy is that of critical damping.",17
454,", the equation of motion of a mass constrained by a spring and dashpot is, in the well-known standard form,  Here we shall consider  as fixed and  as a variable (in practice, a variable spring stiffness) and for convenience we shall write  for ; this  is a variable parameter, which may be positive or negative: in the latter case, the motion is a damped oscillation.",17
455,"If x is proportional to expt, we have to satisfy  and for  we therefore have two different roots: either two real roots or a conjugate complex pair.",17
456,"However, for  (the critical damping case) the two roots coalesce into a repeated (real) root,  = ",17
457,"If we write v for x, the equation of motion may be written as the first-order pair  or, when{ x, v}is proportional to expt,  This requires  Giving the eigenvalues  for each of which  is simply degenerate.",17
458,"In the critical case, when{ ge}vanishes, we have two equal eigenvalues -{gm}, but I — B(0) is still simply degenerate; thus  and so the column  makes this vanish.",17
459,"Squaring it, we obtain a null matrix,  is satisfied by two linearly independent arbitrary columns.",17
460,"As we have seen, one of them must be  the most general form of the other is .",17
461,"Choosing  we find Equation (13) to be, in this case,  with the spectral matrix (on the right) in the standard canonical form for a defective matrix.",17
462,There is a further interpretation of this which is of great importance.,17
463,"With  general, we may write the eigenvectors corresponding to ,  respectively; hence the operation  and  is converted to the standard canonical form for matrices with distinct eigenvalues.",17
464,"However, this similar transformation fails when : the two columns of X(O) become identical, its reciprocal becomes infinite.",17
465,"However, if we postmultiply  by a matrix which in effect sums and differences the columns, thus:  then a similar transformation  yields  as follows:  i.e. a quasi-canonical form: it is to be remembered that the standard canonical forms are conventional, but not unique.",17

469,(c) Extension of Sylvester's expansion,17
470,"We come finally to the confluent form of Sylvester's expansion for any polynomial, and again we use the matrices A and B as exemplifying the  general case; however, for greater generality we shall write the repeated roots as  the unrepeated root as  and shall replace the unit in the superdiagonal of  by r.",17

580,"Without loss of generality we may take ; for, since the rank of a matrix is unaltered by transposition, we may consider the product either as C = AB or CT = BTAT, with the matrix of greater degeneracy on the right.",17
581,"We also recall the result proved in 1.12: if a matrix of rank r is multiplied by a non-singular matrix, the product has rank r.",17
582,"This is because the non-singular matrix may be regarded as made up of elementary operations, and these cannot change the rank of a non-vanishing minor of order r.",17
583,This is a special case of Sylvester's law: the degeneracy is n — r and n — r; i.e. it is n — r.,17
584,"We now turn to the general case, and approach it a simple example.",17
585,"Let A, B be standard canonical forms, with n — p, n — q consecutive units in the respective diagonals, beginning at top left, and with zeros elsewhere.",17

590,"This example not only illustrates Sylvester's law; it also makes the important point that the degeneracy of the product depends on the relative positions of the units, and therefore of the linearly independent columns, in the two factors.",17

607,"We give two examples (i) Let  Here A is of degeneracy 1, B and C each of degeneracy 2.",17
608,"Now by building up P and Q by elementary operations (see 1.12) we obtain  giving the canonical form for A. Similarly, for B we obtain  Inverting Q and R, we find  Hence D is given by   and D is of degeneracy 2.",17
609,Note that here the submatrix  is  and we can take the first two columns as linearly independent; the third is obtained by subtracting half the first from the second.,17
610,"(ii) If we transfer the last column of A to the first position, we have a new matrix A; with B unchanged we then have  A is again of degeneracy 1, B of degeneracy 2; but here C is of degeneracy 3.",17
611,"We leave it to the reader to follow the steps of Example (i), merely noting that, in the present example,  is  with a null column in the first position.",17
612,Theorem XIII — a necessary and sufficient condition that a real symmetric matrix A shall be positive definite is that all its leading discriminants shall be positive.,17
613,"If  is the real symmetric matrix of a quadratic form , then the determinant  is called the discriminant of the form.",17
614,"The leading minor discriminant of order 1 is  of order 2 is , .",17
615,"Thus if A is to be pos. def., the theorem requires that , all i.",17
616,The vector x is real and non-null but otherwise arbitrary.,17
617,"First, we put x = e1. then  reduced to , which must be positive if f is pos. def.",17
618,"Next, put  Now f reduces to  which, with  requires also that .",17
619,"We might proceed in this way, but a different approach is simpler.",17
620,"In the full expansion of f, collect together all the terms involving x1; they may be written as a perfect square,  where B is a quadratic form involving ,…, xn only.",17
621,"Now we collect all terms involving  and write them as a perfect square, , ultimately we can write the form as   where in fact  and  while y is related to x by the triangular substitution (see (20))  and .",17
622,"Hence f = , , and  Now put xn = 0.",17
623,"Then f may now be written as the quadratic form of which the matrix is the leading minor of A of order b — 1, and we may deduce, corresponding to (22),  Now, by putting  we establish a similar result for  , finally we establish that  From (21) it is clear that a necessary and sufficient condition that f shall be positive is that Di shall be positive, all i.",17
624,It then follows from (23) that all the discriminants  must also be positive; this also is both necessary and sufficient.,17
625,This theorem was first established by Sylvester.,17
626,"Theorem XIV — If two matrices A, B permute, then provided one is non-defective, they share the same modal matrix.",17
627,"Let  where C is the canonical spectral matrix  of A, and X is the modal matrix of A:X is not unique; if we have any matrix Y which permutes with C, then from (24) AXY = XCY = XYC we can write the modal matrix of A alternatively as XY.",17
628,"Now write  D is a similar transform of B. Then it follows from AB = BA, on use of (24) and (26), that  CD = DC.",17
629,We now consider three cases.,17
630,(a) The eigenvalues of A are all different.,17
631,"Thus A is non-defective, and C is diagonal, all the diagonal elements being different.",17
632,"In this case (see 1.9(3)), D must also be diagonal;(26) then shows that D is the spectral matrix of B, which thus shares the modal matrix X with A. Note that D can have equal elements (including zeros) in its diagonal.",17
633,"(b) A is non-defective, but has some repeated eigenvalues.",17
634,"Thus C is diagonal; we assume it to be in standard canonical form, i.e. it has equal eigenvalues grouped together: this only requires the columns of X to be written in appropriate order.",17
635,"Suppose, , that C has m eigenvalues{ ga}, in a submatrix of order m in the leading diagonal place: there may be similar submatrices down the diagonal.",17
636,"Thus C possesses a scalar submatrix  in the leading position; Equation (28)(see 1.9(3) again) now permits D to have a corresponding submatrix, also of order m, arbitrarily populated: thus D will have a block diagonal form.",17
637,"Now in this case D can be reduced to a standard canonical form E by a similar transformation  where Y has precisely the same block diagonal form as D; in effect, each diagonal block is resolved into its own canonical form.",17
638,"But in this case, Y will, like D, permute with C; thus from (25) the modal matrix of A may be written XY, while (26) and (29) require  B shares the modal matrix XY with A. Note that here, E need not be diagonal, B can be defective; but non-zero elements in the superdiagonal of E can only occur in a submatrix corresponding to a scalar submatrix in C.",17
639,This establishes the theorem as stated.,17
640,"(c) For completeness, we look briefly at the case where A is defective.",17
641,"Suppose, , that C has the leading submatrix  then the most general submatrix of D which will permute with C1 is   where d, e, f are arbitrary.",17
642,Thus D1 is not of standard canonical form; to make it so we must remove f.,17
643,"Now while, we can find a submatrix Y1  where E1 is of standard canonical form, Y1 is not of the general form D1 and so will not permute with C1.",17
644,"In this case, A has the modal matrix X, B the modal matrix XY.",17
645,", it is possible for B to be such that f = 0, when D1 is in standard canonical form: A and B then share the modal matrix X, though both are defective.",17
646,The obvious (trivial) example of this is that of a defective matrix permuting with itself.,17
647,"But , if A and B are both defective, they do not have a common modal matrix.",17
648,"the above, it is clear that two matrices having the same modal matrix do not necessarily permute; they will do so only if their spectral matrices permute.",17
649,Corollaries,17
650,"(i) If A, B permute, so do powers of A, B.  (ii) If A, B permute, and the eigenvalues of A are all different, then B can be expressed as a polynomial in A.",17
651,"As (a) above, here  where C, D are both diagonal.",17
652,"Now consider the general polynomial  We can identify P(C) with D; this requires  where 1,…, n are the diagonal elements of C, and d1,…, dn those of D. The square matrix in (30) is known as an alternant: its reciprocal is discussed in Ref (P1).",17
653,Equation (30) defines the coefficients   which establishes the corollary.,17
654,"It is capable of extension, but we shall not pursue the matter here.",17
655,"There is a considerable literature concerning permutable matrices, see, , Turnbull an Aitken (4).",17
656,"Theorem XV — Sylvester's ""Law of Inertia"" ",17
657,"Let a real symmetric matrix A be rendered diagonal by a congruent transformation , where B is, , non-singular.",17
658,"Then the numbers of positive, zero, and negative elements in the diagonal of  are invariant with B.",17
659,The number of matrices B which diagonalise A in this manner is indefinitely large: to prove the theorem we need only show that it holds for any two.,17
660,"Our first choice is B = X, where X is the orthogonal modal matrix of A (being symmetrical, A cannot be defective: see Theorem X) , the spectral matrix of A. Our other choice is , where L is the lower triangular matrix having units in its diagonal and its other elements so chosen that LA is upper triangular, when , a diagonal matrix.",17
661,"It is a simple exercise, which we leave to the reader, to show that the process of triangulation of A by LA without row interchanges gives the elements  discussed in Theorem XIII, where the  are the principal discriminants of A and : and example (for a non-symmetric matrix) is given in ",17
662,"We first note that if A is of rank r, then so are ; for since , B, may be regarded as made of elementary operations  which cannot change the rank of a matrix.",17
663,"Thus both  and D will have n — r zeros in their diagonals, which establishes part of the theorem.",17
664,"To prove the remainder, we suppose the theorem does not hold; let  have p positive and r — p negative elements its n — r zeros, and D have q positive and r — q negative elements.",17
665,"Then  where, since we have introduced the negative signs, all non-zero i and are positive numbers.",17
666,"We begin by supposing p = q + s, where s is a positive number, ; and we examine the general quadratic form .",17
667,"If  then  These two expressions are equal for all x; subtraction yields   Let us seek a vector x  Now from (31), ; thus the first part of (33) provides n — p relations of the form , and the second part, q similar relations: a total of n — p + q = n — s relations.",17
668,"But x has n elements, we can find only n — s of its elements the remaining s (see  an example is given in 2.5) which are arbitrary.",17
669,Thus a vector x satisfying (33) has s arbitrary elements.,17
670,"Now substitute (33) into (32); the RHS vanishes, and so, therefore, does the LHS.",17
671,"With all  positive this implies,  This, taken together with (33), gives y = 0 which (31) gives x = 0.",17
672,"We thus have two results; x has s arbitrary elements, and x is null: these can only be reconciled if s = 0, when q = p.",17
673,"If we now take , a similar argument leads to the same result q = p.",17
674,"Since the argument does not depend on the nature of X and L, the result is generally true, and the theorem established.",17
675,"The invariant p is known as the index of positiveness, or simply the index, of A and its quadratic form.",17
676,"Examples XV (a) Let  then its orthogonal matrix X is  which yields  We build up L as the product , where L1 annihilates the last three elements of the first column of A, L2 the last two elements of the second column, and L3 the last element of the third column; then   Then  and the diagonal elements of LA are those of D =  We see that both  and D have two positive and two negative elements.",17

683,SOME NUMERICAL METHODS,17
684,2.1 INTRODUCTION,17
685,In this chapter we shall discuss some numerical methods for solving problems formulated matrices.,17
686,"However, it must be stressed at the outset that we can do no more here than to indicate the basic principles involved, and give illustrations of a few of the almost innumerable variants of basic methods that exist.",17
687,"Quot homines, tot sententiae: almost every worker in the field has his pet variation, which suits him ad his computer better than any other.",17
688,"For a wider discussion, readers are referred to texts Bodewig (5) and Wilkinson (6).",17
689,Most of the numerical problems which arise in matrix studies (particularly those which derive from dynamical systems) lead ultimately to one or both of two basic processes:(a) the inversion of a numerical matrix;(b) the evaluation of its eigenvalues and vectors.,17
690,It will be convenient to deal with these under separate headings.,17
691,"The methods themselves also divide into two broad categories:(a) direct methods, in which the solution requires is reached in a finite, predictable number of operations;(b) indirect methods, in which the solution is usually obtained by successive approximation procedures, when the number of operations is determined by the rate of convergence.",17
692,I: RECIPROCATION; LINEAR ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS,17
693,2.2 DIRECT METHOD FOR MATRIX INVERSION,17
694,Under this heading we give three methods which are all very different in principle.,17
695,Each has variants; for each there are circumstances which favour its use.,17
696,2.2.1.,17
697,Pivotal condensation,17
698,"This method is the simplest, and probably the most universally used.",17
699,Suppose we have a square matrix A =  of order n for which we require to find the reciprocal R: then AR = I.,17
700,"Now it is possible to write down a sequence of matrices  Mr (r is usually n or n + 1, the variant employed) which when used as a chain to premultiply A, condense it to the unit matrix,  which evidently implies  The numerical procedure is to operate successively on 91); given A we can write down M1 and we evaluate  (1) becomes  Knowing B we can now write down  and form  , until R is obtained.",17
701,"As we shall see, in practice it is not necessary to write down the matrices  merely perform simple operations with the rows of A and I in (1), which is all the matrices  do.",17
702,"For ease of exposition, let us suppose n = 4.",17
703,"Consider the matrix product, corresponding to (3)",17
704, In writing down  we have first arbitrarily selected a non-zero element  of A as a pivot (underlined) for this first step in the operation.,17
705, is then obtained from the unit matrix by replacing its second column (corresponding to the subscript 2 of  by the third column of A divided through by  with negative signs for the off-diagonal elements.,17
706,The third column of B is then null a unit in the position corresponding to ,17
707,"The product makes it clear that all we are doing, in fact, is to operate with the rows of A in a manner similar to that often used in the condensation of determinants.",17
708,Thus row 1 of B is now 1 of A minus  times row 2 of A; row 2 of B is row 2 of A divided throughout by 3; row 3 of B is row 3 of A minus  times row 2 of A; .,17
709,"Having obtained B, we now select a pivotal element in it for the next step; the selection is arbitrary the element must be nonzero and must not be in the second row, which contains the unit.",17
710, in which  has been chosen as the pivotal element.,17
711,"We now choose a pivotal element in C, excluding rows 2 and 3 containing the units.",17
712,"Note that  and  cannot both be zero, or A would be singular and R would not exist; similarly for  We choose a nonzero element from these  four -say  and then  The last step is not arbitrary: we must exclude the first three rows (containing units), the only choice for pivot in the next step is D44, which cannot be zero.",17
713,"We write down , evaluate E =  obtaining a matrix which if the rows are rearranged by premultiplication by an obvious matrix , becomes the unit matrix.",17
714,"As we have said, in practice we do not need to write down M1 etc.",17
715,When we use  as a premultiplier of (1) we combine the rows of I in exactly the same ways as those of A. We can therefore write the two arrays side by side and operate on rows of 2n elements.,17
716,", to summarise what has been done above (we refer to row i as ) we use Table 1.",17
717," When the left-hand array has been condensed to I, the right hand array is R.  This method has a number of variants.",17
718,"First, it is possible to operate with columns, using postmultiplying matrices Mi; but this is really only transposition of operations on rows.",17
719,The variants derive mainly from the choice of pivot.,17
720,"In the so-called optimal pivoting method, one chooses the element of largest modulus from among those available.",17
721,"In a second variant, one chooses the element of largest modulus in each column in turn; in a third, the diagonal elements are chosen in order; and in a fourth, the diagonal elements of largest modulus are chosen in turn.",17
722,"The third has the advantage that no final rearrangement of rows is required; on the other hand, it fails if a pivot becomes zero, or even very small.",17
723,"The third variant is usually described as ""diagonal pivoting without row interchange"" , the fourth as ""diagonal pivoting with pivotal strategy"" .",17
724,It is to be observed that the determinant of A is readily found from the condensation procedure.,17
725,"The determinant of  is , etc.",17
726,"It follows that the determinant of A is , i.e. the product of the pivotal elements chosen, multiplied by the determinant of , which rearranges the rows, and so has the value , to whether the number of interchanges is even or odd.",17
727,Example 1,17
728,"We exemplify these procedures using the matrix  This matrix, in fact, has the determinant 100; since its elements are integers, the elements of the reciprocal will be terminating decimals.",17
729,"In the intermediate steps, however, the numbers are incommensurable: for brevity of exposition we give four decimal places only, though a computer will normally employ a much greater number.",17
730,(i) Optimal pivoting,17
731,"In Table 2, the last array on the right is the required reciprocal.",17
732,"Note that, in the rearrangement of the last step, we crossed three rows in bringing  to the top; then the new second row  crossed two rows in going to the bottom.",17
733,"Since the total number of crossings, 5 is odd,  has the determinant -1; accordingly       Coincidentally, this example also illustrates he second variant: it is adventitious that the largest element among those available occurs in the first, second, third and fourth column in succession.",17
734,There is thus no difference in the working.,17
735,"However, in the optimum method a computer is required to scan all elements available, i.e.  in successive steps, while in the second variant only m,(n — 1),…, 1 need scanning.",17
736,"In this example, therefore, the second variant has the advantage; in a matrix of large order, the scanning process can take considerable computer time.",17
737,"No scanning is needed in the third variant, where the diagonal elements are prescribed.",17
738,(ii) Diagonal pivoting,17
739,We now treat the same matrix by the third variant (see Table 3).,17
740,"For this example, this variant presents no difficulty.",17
741,Also  as before.,17
742,"The student is invited to effect this reciprocation the fourth variant, in which the largest diagonal element available is chosen as the pivot at each stage; it begins with the bottom right-hand element.",17
743,2.2.2 The method of submatrices,17
744,"This method has nothing the pivotal method, but has great advantages in certain circumstances.",17
745,"(a) Suppose we have a computer which will accommodate a matrix of order m, but we require to reciprocate a larger matrix A of order n where .",17
746,"(b) Suppose we have a matrix B of which we know the reciprocal ; B is now bordered, it becomes a submatrix of a larger matrix A, and we require A-1.",17
747,The method of submatrices is particularly useful in solving both these problems.,17
748,"Let A be partitioned in the form  Here A is of order n, B of order m, E of order n — m; C and D are rectangular.",17
749,"Let the reciprocal of A be similarly partitioned:   Then the equations  provide relations from which, ,  , may be explicitly found.",17
750,"Various formulae are possible, but the most advantageous from the computational standpoint appear to be the following.",17
751,"Write  Then  as may be checked by evaluating  It is to be noted that, although these formulae involve a number of multiplications, only two reciprocations, B-1 (of order m) and  (of order n — m) are involved.",17
752,Problem (a),17
753,It is clear that the formulae just established provide a method of solution for problem (a) since  and the computer can reciprocate both B and  and perform the required multiplications.,17
754,Example 1,17
755,"Although it is very small, we may use the matrix A of Equation (2.2.1.4) to illustrate the principles involved.",17
756,"We shall here partition it into four square submatrices, each of order 2.",17
757,In this simple illustrative case we avoid decimals.,17
758,"Thus    We are now able to evaluate the remaining submatrices of the reciprocal as  Accordingly, the reciprocal is  in agreement with the result found earlier.",17
759,Problem (b),17
760,It is also clear that Equations (3) and (4) provide a solution for this problem.,17
761,We are given  and we border B as in (1) and apply our solution to obtain  The working is then exactly as in the example just given.,17
762,"The formulae are, however, rendered much simpler if we have only line bordering, i.e. C is a column, D a row, and E a scalar.",17
763,"Then X is a column, Y a raw, and  a scalar.",17
764,"It follows that we can provide the answer to a third problem,(c): the successive evaluation of the reciprocals of the leading minors of a matrix A until  is achieved.",17
765,Example 2,17
766,"Again, we choose the matrix A of Equation (2.2.1.4):(i) The leading minor of order 1, b1, is the element 6: reciprocal 1/6. (ii) Using (i), we apply the formulae (3),(4) to find the reciprocal of the leading minor of order 2, viz:  Here   and we deduce  (iii) We now use this result to examine the third order minor  Then  similarly,  Also  Note that, in Equations (4) which we now evaluate,  is a matrix of rank 1.",17
767,"We find  (iv) Using , we proceed to obtain the reciprocal of .",17
768,"We leave this step to the reader, but observe that ",17
769,"Since an element in the reciprocal of a matrix M is defined as the ratio of the cofactor of the corresponding element in M to the determinant , it follows that, ,  and hence   In this example, therefore, ",17
770,2.2.3 Column (or row) building,17
771,"This method makes use of Theorem IX of  which states that if we have a square matrix Ao of order n, and know , then by a simple calculation we can find the reciprocal  of a new matrix , where  is a unit rank matrix, also of order n,  being an arbitrary column and row respectively.",17
772,"A second application of the theorem enables us to find , where  , until we find , where  In this present context, suppose we have a matrix A of order n and require to find its reciprocal.",17
773,"Then it is possible, using (1), so to choose, , etc. that Ao is transformed into A, when a last simple calculation gives  The method has many variants: we can build A column by column, or row by row, or column and row simultaneously.",17
774,We give here what seems to be the simplest approach.,17
775,We choose  (or possibly a scalar matrix ).,17
776,"Then, if  is the isolating row vector, we form  Here  is the first column of A the leading element  is diminished by 1; thus the first column of  is identical with that of A, while the (n — 1) remaining columns are those of I. By Theorem IX of 1.22  Next we evaluate (this step is not quite so simple)   Here  is the second column of A but with the second element reduced by 1;  and  is the second element of  Further steps follow this  pattern and are obvious.",17
777,"We may, however, observe that (4) may be written  i.e. as the sum of  and a rank 1 matrix of which the rows are proportional to the second row of .",17
778,Example 1,17
779,"We choose the same numerical matrix as before (Equation (2.2.1.4)), viz:    ",17
780,2.2.4 Triangulation,17
781,"We have already seen, in  that reciprocation of a triangular matrix can be achieved by a simple process of back-substitution.",17
782,"Accordingly, if we first reduce a matrix A to triangular form we can then proceed to determine its reciprocal.",17
783,"The usual reduction to triangular form is by a pivotal condensation similar to that described in 2.2.1, we only remove elements below the diagonal.",17
784,We may best illustrate this with out usual example (see Table 1).,17
785,"What we have done is to keep  but use it to eliminate the leading elements of  , reducing the number of rows by 1 at each step.",17
786,"We have now, in effect, achieved the equation    This has been obtained by triangulation without row interchange.",17
787,"If we now proceed to the process of back-substitution, this is in effect operating again with rows, and all it does is to compete the process which was done continuously in the pivotal condensation of 2.2.1.",17
788,There is thus no advantage in he intermediate triangulation step.,17
789,"However, much attention has been given in the literature to inversion of triangular matrices by methods back-substitution, particularly iterative methods.",17
790,We illustrate below one direct method.,17
791,Triangulation has many important uses.,17
792,"When we reduce a matrix A to triangular form, we write it as .",17
793,We may first note that the product of the diagonal elements of the leading matrix in (1) is evidently .,17
794,"If we divide each row through by its diagonal element,(1) becomes  The leading matrix here is of the form I + C, where C is null the elements above the diagonal.",17
795,"Now, provided  as r increases,  as may be checked by premultiplication by I + C. In this example   and on use of (3) we obtain from a single multiplication  Premultiplication of(2) by (4) yields finally  in agreement with results given earlier.",17
796,2.3 ITERATIVE METHODS,17
797,"These methods are well suited to computers and often have the advantage that, should an error occur, it lengthens the computations .",17
798,2.3.1 Improvement of an approximate reciprocal,17
799,"This is an important topic; it often happens that an approximate reciprocal of a matrix A is known: perhaps from a rough calculation, or one in which an error has been made, or even that belonging to a neighbour matrix of A. Refinement of this approximate reciprocal is then required.",17
800,The usual procedure is as follows.,17
801,Let R be the exact reciprocal and  the approximation.,17
802,"Write  Then  Premultiply by  then since   Thus  is a new approximation to R, and we may repeat the cycle as required to obtain R, convergence of the method.",17
803,The conditions for this are readily established.,17
804,From (2) we find.,17
805, and further steps give   .,17
806,"Thus, provided  as r increases, the method will converge very rapidly.",17
807,"This will normally be the case of R1 is a reasonably good approximation, when the elements of  will be small.",17
808,"At each step the method requires the multiplication of two matrices AR1, the subtraction of the result from 2I, and then the second multiplication, e.g.  to obtain the next approximation.",17
809,An alternative procedure which achieves the same result but is more convenient computationally is the following.,17
810,"Write  Then  Inversion of this and premultiplication of the result by R1 gives, provided  as r increases.",17
811," It is readily checked, (3) et seq., that he product of the first two terms in (5) is R2, of the first three is R3, .",17
812,The number of matrix multiplications in this procedure is the same as before; but the squaring of  etc. is usually relatively easy since they become rapidly smaller in practice.,17
813,"Indeed, if, in (5),  and higher powers are sensibly null to the order of accuracy required, we can write  saving one multiplication.",17
814,"In practice, since the numbers in  and I become progressively and rapidly more disparate, it is better to deal with them separately; i.e. the operations in (5) are carried on as follows; we are given A and R1:(i) evaluate  (ii) evaluation …until to the order of accuracy required a power of E1 is sensibly null.",17
815,"(ii) evaluate  and add R to get R ,(iv) evaluate  and add  to get ,(v) evaluate  and add  to get , .",17
816,"Normally, very few steps are needed.",17
817,Example 1,17
818,"Suppose we are given  Then A is the matrix of our previous examples, and R1 an approximate reciprocal, given to three places of decimals.",17
819,"It is required to find the reciprocal R of A, correct to six places of decimals.",17
820,Then  where the figures are exact.,17
821," is thus exact to six decimal places, viz:  but  would require 12 decimal places.",17
822,We retain only eight:  an to this order of accuracy  is null.,17
823,"Hence   Since  is null, we can apply (6), when  where we have retained eight decimal places.",17
824,"Finally, to six decimal places  ",17
825,2.3.1 General Iteration,17
826,The most general iteration procedure appears to be the following.,17
827,"We require to solve RA = I for R. Write the known matrix A as A = B — C, where B is a matrix having a known (or easily found) reciprocal.",17
828,Then the problem can be written  where we have written  There are various iterative methods for solving (2).,17
829,", we may write it as  and use the regression formula  , , if Ro = 0, we should obtain  .",17
830,"Evidently, these are successive steps in the solution of (2), which is valid of  as r increases.",17
831," A rather more rapid method is to write (5) as  For the simple reciprocation of a matrix A these methods hardly compete with pivotal condensation; however, they do have a place in the parallel problem of solution of linear algebraic equations.",17
832,"It must be stressed, however, that the choice of B must be such at  has eigenvalues with moduli all less than unity; Sylvester's expansion then shows that  as r increases.",17
833,There are certain physical problems yielding matrices for which this can be guaranteed; but some trial and error is involved.,17
834,It should be noted that (2) can be written alternatively as   leading to  It is important to observe that this general iteration procedure is really exactly the same as the method given in 2.3.1 for improvement of an approximate reciprocal.,17
835,"The first of Equations (4) shows that  is an approximate reciprocal, and then Equations (2.3.1.5) and (6) are the same, provided E1 and E are the same.",17
836,"Now, if B-1 is the same as R1,  the methods are effectively the same.",17
837,"This result shows that, although in (1) no restriction is placed on B, it must in practice be a reasonable approximation to  if the method is to converge.",17
838,Example 1,17
839,We illustrate Equation (6) here.,17
840,"Let  Here we have chosen B as the lower triangular portion of A, and C is B — A. We are   To four places of decimals we now find  and to this order of accuracy,  is null.",17
841,"Then, successively (note that these are not the steps of (4)).",17
842, and  is in fact the exact reciprocal of A. ,17
843,2.3.3 Special iteration procedures,17
844,In Equation (2.3.2.1) the only restriction placed on B was that it should have a known or easily-found reciprocal.,17
845,We now discuss two particular choices for B.,17
846,(a) Seidel iteration.,17
847,"Here B is chosen to be the lower triangular part of A, including the diagonal, with all superdiagonal elements null.",17
848,B is then reciprocated as in 1.9(8) an the methods of the last paragraph applied.,17
849,The example given there is in fact an illustration of Seidel iteration.,17
850,(b) Simple or diagonal iteration.,17
851,Here B is chosen to be the diagonal matrix of the diagonal elements of A. Its reciprocal can therefore be written down.,17
852,"It is mostly used when A is a ""sparse"" matrix, with elements dominated by the diagonal; B-1 is then a reasonable approximation to R. If this is not the case, the method may not converge, or do so very slowly.",17
853,", if we take the matrix A of the last example, an choose  then  This matrix has two real eigenvalues, 0.319 and 0.597, and a pair of complex eigenvalues of modulus 0.999.",17
854,The powers of E therefore converge very slowly indeed.,17
855,A better illustration follows.,17
856,Example 1,17
857,"Let   Then, if we retain eight decimal places  Hence, if  , we find as successive approximations to  correct to six decimal places, ",17
858,2.4.,17
859,SPECIAL TYPES OF MATRIX,17
860,Certain matrices have properties which make reciprocation rather easier than would otherwise be the case.,17
861,We give a few examples.,17
862,2.4.1 Symmetric matrices,17
863,The reciprocal R of a symmetric matrix is itself symmetric.,17
864,"For if A is symmetric and we transpose AR = I to get  then evidently  (see also 1.22, Theorem I, Corollary).",17
865,"  It follows that we do not need to compute all the  elements of R; n (n + 1) /2 elements, comprised in the diagonal and below, are all that are required.",17
866,Example 1,17
867,We give in Table 1 a scheme for pivotal condensation of the matrix just examined in Example 2.3.3.1.,17
868,"For convenience, the reciprocal has been multiplied by 103; we work to six decimal places on the left, three on the right.",17
869,"If the last four rows of Table 1 are taken in reverse order, the required reciprocal is obtained.",17
870,"It is to be noted that the starred numbers in Table 1 do not need to be calculated, though it is convenient to write them down.",17
871,"appropriate proportions of  are  from  as they stand to give zeros in the first column, the array of numbers on the left in  can be written down; when the rest of  is found, the third element of  can be inserted, .",17
872,"Also, when  is reached, this gives the last row of R and hence also the last column, the eighth elements in  can be written down, .",17
873,"However, in practice, the programming required to avoid these calculations could be more time-consuming than the straight pivotal condensation, when the symmetry of the final result gives a check on the calculations.",17
874,The procedure in Table 1 also exemplifies triangulation without row interchange.,17
875,The product of the underlines elements in the table gives .,17
876,2.4.2 Positive definite (symmetric) matrix,17
877,The method to be described is usually attributed to Choleski.,17
878,"It is a simple matter, which we leave to the reader, to show that if A is real, symmetric and positive definite, then it can be written as the product BTB where B is real and triangular.",17
879,"Then if  and since B is triangular,  is readily found.",17
880,We give a simple example.,17
881,Example 1,17
882,Let  The leading element gives  (use of — 10 makes no difference).,17
883,"Then ab = 30, b = 3; ac = 10, c = 1; ad = -10, d = -1.",17
884,Next  .,17
885,"In this way it is quickly established that  Inversion of B as in 1.9(8) then yields  and then  It may be of interest to note that if x ={p, q, r, s}is any vector of real numbers, not all zero, then the quadratic form  may be written (see also 1.22, Theorem XIII)  where  , where the second term does not involve p, the third p, q, and the fourth p, q, r,  and is always positive under the conditions given.",17
886,"If A is not pos. def., the elements of B are complex.",17
887,2.4.3 Persymmetric matrix,17
888,"The reciprocal of a persymmetric matrix is not also persymmetric; e.g.   A persymmetric matrix can be treated as symmetric for the purpose of reciprocation, but otherwise it is not special.",17
889,2.4.4 Centrosymmetric matrix,17
890,"We shall consider here only matrices of even order; the odd-order case is quite straightforward, but is algebraically more complicated.",17
891,"A centrosymmetric matrix A is characterise by A = JAJ, where J is the reversing matrix.",17
892,"Inversion of this gives  since J2 = I; the reciprocal of A is therefore also centrosymmetric, as are the integral powers of A. If A is of order 2m, it can be partitioned into four submatrices, each of order m, thus  other representations are possible, but this appears to be the most convenient.",17
893,If (2) is premultiplied and postmultiplied by  the result is A as required.,17
894,"We can write the reciprocal of A as  and then the product of (2) and (3) yields (twice)  These may be solved if either P or Q is non-singular; we assume P-1 exists, and we write R for P-1Q.",17
895,"Then from (4) we obtain  The reciprocation of A may thus be effected through two reciprocations of order m, the much more laborious single reciprocation of order 2m.",17
896,Example 1,17
897,"Consider  Then, in the above nomenclature  Accordingly,  A caution must be added: the method is not always viable.",17
898,"Thus, ,  but this result cannot be obtained by use of (4) since by inspection the submatrices of order 2 are all singular.",17
899,2.5 LINEAR ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS,17
900,A set of linear algebraic equations (often called simultaneous equations) has the form Ax = p.,17
901,"Here A is, , a rectangular matrix of order m × n with given elements, p is a given column of m elements, and x a column of n unknowns; it is required to find x.",17
902,Suppose first that .,17
903,Then we have more equations than unknowns.,17
904,"If (1) is soluble, there must be n independent equations; if these are written first, we can partition (1) in the form  where B is square and non-singular.",17
905,"Then  If s does not satisfy (2) the set of equations is inconsistent, and (1) does not have a valid solution.",17
906,"If, however, the equations are consistent, then the solution (2) for x uses only n of them; the remainder are superfluous.",17
907,Now let.,17
908,"In this case, we have fewer equations than unknowns; we now partition (1) in the form (B, C){y, z}= p, where B is square, of order m, and y is a column of m quantities.",17
909,"We now obtain the partial solution for x  in which we determine m of the unknowns x B, C, p and the remaining m — n unknowns z.",17
910,This is the parametric solution of 1.10.,17
911,Example 1,17
912," Consider  as partitioned, the solution is (see (2))  and  the  are consistent; if they are taken any two at a time, the three cases all yield the same answer.",17
913,"However, had the last element in p been 4, the three pairs of equations would have given three different answers.",17
914,Example 2,17
915,.,17
916,"Here, a simple example is  which yields  In Examples 1 and 2 the main numerical problem is the solution of BX = r, By = p — Cz, where B is square.",17
917,We now confine our attention to the case where A is square and non-singular; this is obviously germane to the above solutions.,17
918,2.5.1 Direct Method,17
919,"Our problem is to solve Ax = p, for x; here A is a given square and non-singular matrix of order n, p is a given column of n quantities, and x a column of n unknowns.",17
920,"Formally, the solution is obvious: x = A-1p.",17
921,"We can therefore obtain our solution by inverting, using any of the methods of 2.2, 2.3, and postmultiplying the inverse by p.",17
922,"In some problems we require to obtain x for each of a set of values for p; e.g. the elements of p may be functions of an independent variable, and we require x for each of a number of values of the variable.",17
923,If this number is high — if it exceeds n — then labour is saved by inverting A and using (2).,17
924,"If, on the other hand, the number is small, labour is saved as follows.",17
925,"We use the approach of 2.2.1; but operating on (2.2.1.1) with the matrices Mi, we operate directly on (1).",17
926,"Evidently, we then progressively approach the solution (2).",17
927,"The computations, by simple operations on rows, are effected in exactly the same way.",17
928,"Indeed, reciprocation is really only the solution of a particular set of linear algebraic equations, in which the vectors p are successively  For a single set, in pace of e1 we use the single vector p.",17
929,Example 1,17
930,Suppose we require to solve   The square matrix used here is that employed for the Examples of 2.2; we choose diagonal pivoting without row interchange.,17
931,The working of the left-hand array is thus identical with that of Example 2.2.2.1.,17
932,See Table 1.,17
933,The last four figures in the right-hand array are given correct to three decimal places and are in fact the exact solution.,17
934,2.5.2 Iterative methods,17
935,"We exemplify the general iteration procedure of 2.3.2; we write B — C for A, where the reciprocal of B is known or easily obtained.",17
936,"Then Equation (2.5.1.1) can be written  , if F is written for B-1C, the solution is given by  say.",17
937,"As before, this may be developed in either of two ways, provided  as r increases: x = q + Fx, suggesting the regression formula  or  Though the computations may be different, these two formulae are equivalent; for if xo = 0 the regression formula gives  .",17
938,We illustrate (3) below.,17
939,Example 1,17
940,It is required to solve  The square matrix has been used in Example 2.3.2.1.,17
941,"We again choose B to be A the elements to the right of the principal diagonal are all zero: then, as before     Note that here F = B-1C: in the previous example, E = CB-1.",17
942,"We now construct the iteration table (see Table 1), beginning with x1 = q and applying (3).",17
943,"Since, the fact that F has two null columns, the first two elements of x are always multiplied by zeros, it is not necessary to compute them until the iterations are complete.",17
944,"At the beginning of the iteration, we have retained only two decimal places: later three, then four, until to this order of accuracy the iteration repeats.",17
945,"Finally, the first two elements are computed, when the last column (here x10) is the solution required.",17
946,"It may be observed that equations of the form x = q + Fx arise naturally in some dynamical or quasi-static problems, e.g. the distortion of a structure under applied load, when the load is varied by the distortion.",17
947,2.5.3 Choleski's method for positive definite matrices,17
948,Let us now suppose that in 2.5.1 A is pos. def.,17
949,Then as in 2.4.2 we can write A as  where B is triangular.,17
950,The equations for solution are now  Write y for Bx; then (1) can be solved in two steps:  and then Bx = y for x.,17
951,"It may be noted that a set of equations Ax = p, where A is general, may be cast in the above form by premultiplication by AT:  However, this does not appear to offer any computational advantage.",17
952,"Resolution of  into  implies A = CB where C is an orthogonal matrix, .",17
953,"Again, however, this does not appear to offer any worthwhile computational short-cut.",17
954,Example 1,17
955,"Suppose we wish to solve  As in 2.4.2, we can quickly resolve the square matrix into  A self-explanatory scheme for computation is shown in Table 1.",17
956,"Here BT, p are written at the head of the left-hand array; by obvious row combinations we find y at the bottom.",17
957,"This and B are inserted at the top of the right-hand array, when again obvious row combinations give the required solution at the bottom right: in summary  ",17
958,2.5.4 Least squares,17
959,"In 2.5 we noted that if we have more equations than unknowns, the equations must be consistent, or a unique solution does not exist.",17
960,"Nevertheless, especially in experimental work, cases often arise where the number of equations exceeds the number of unknowns.",17
961,", suppose we have a measurable quantity f which we have reason to suppose is a polynomial function of an independent variable t:  and we wish to find the m coefficients .",17
962,"Measurement of f at each of m values of t would provide m equations for the m unknowns; however, since f is measured and so is inexact, it may be thought better to measure f at n values of t, where  to minimise the effects of experimental error.",17
963,How do we proceed to find optimum values of the coefficients ?,17
964,"The ""least squares"" solution of this problem is Gauss.",17
965,"Let the n equation in m unknowns  be written Ax -p = e, where A is of the order (n × m), x is the column of m unknowns , p is the column of n measures values of f, and e is a column of n errors.",17
966,We are given A and p; e will vary with x.,17
967,"Gauss' proposition is that x will have its optimum value when the sum of the squares of the errors, ie.e  is a minimum.",17
968,"Now  and for this to be a minimum, its differential x (see 1.11) must vanish; i.e.  which is our original set of Equations (2) with e = 0, premultiplied by AT; it gives m equations for the m unknowns.",17
969,Example 1,17
970,"Suppose we expect the relation (1) to be  and suppose further that we have the following experimental table:   Then (5) our equations for solutions may be written  Before we proceed to the least squares solution, let us see what results would be obtained if we solved these equations three at a time, with e taken to be zero for each set of three.",17
971,We should get  These are all very different.,17
972,"Moreover, if we adopted the first solution and applied it throughout, e would become (the first three elements have been assumed zero)  which is clearly quite unacceptable for the later measurements.",17
973,"However, if we premultiply (6) by AT as in (4) we get  and the solution, by inspection, is x ={1, -2,1}, i.e.  If we now return to (6) and use this solution, we find  which compares very favourably with the result given earlier. ",17
974,2.5.5 Least squares: weighted errors,17
975,"In the basic Gaussian method just described, it has been tacitly assumed that  all errors are equally likely.",17
976,"The method is readily adapted, however, to cases where some weighting of errors is desirable: it is merely a case of premultiplying (2.5.4.2) by an appropriate diagonal matrix.",17
977,Example 1,17
978,"Suppose we wish to put a straight line  through the following set of experimental points:  Suppose further that, the experimental method, we may expect errors in f to be proportional to t.",17
979,Let us first examine the straight Gaussian solution.,17
980,"The equations can clearly be written  Premultiplication by AT yields  the optimum lime, if all errors are equally likely, is f = 0.57t + 1.80.",17
981,"However, we are errors are likely to be proportional to t.",17
982,"To make them equally likely, we must multiply the first of Equations (1), at t = 1, by 6; the second, at t = 2, by 3; the third, at t = 3, by 2, etc; i.e. we premultiply (1) by Diag(6,3,2,1,5,1,2,1).",17
983,The result is   and premultiplication of this by  yields  to two decimal places.,17
984,"Hence in this case, the optimum line is f = 0.50t + 2.01.",17
985,"For comparison, the errors e in the two solutions (2) and (3) are (the lines intersect at t =3)  and it is clear that in the second case the errors increase markedly with t, as required.",17
986,II: EIGENVALUES AND VECTORS,17
987,2.6 THE CHARACTERISTIC EQUATION,17
988,"The n eigenvalues of a square matrix A = (Aij) of order n are given (see 1.16) by the roots of the characteristic equation  which, in expanded form, can be written  In theory, therefore, the calculation of the eigenvalues of A is straightforward: we form the characteristic determinant in (1), expand it to the form (2), and solve this by any suitable means to obtain .",17
989,"Having obtained the eigenvalues, can readily find the corresponding eigenvectors.",17
990,"If r is a known eigenvalue (which we assume here to be unrepeated) and  the corresponding column and row eigenvectors respectively, then   Since  are each arbitrary to a scalar multiplier, we can in each vector make a suitable element unity; then Equations (3) provide in each case n linear algebraic equations for the (n — 1) unknown elements: one equation is superfluous, or can be used as a check.",17
991,", if we make the last element of  unity, and partition () to isolate its last column and row, we can write (3) as  which give  Equations (5) can be solved by any of the methods of 2.5 (the second would be transposed to , and then  Unfortunately, so far as the expansion of (1) to (2) is concerned, theory and practice are at odds.",17
992,"With  general, the labour involved in the expansion is quite prohibitive even for small values of n, and indirect methods are always used in practice.",17
993,"We describe two such methods below; first, however, we observe that, in (2), we can readily obtain the two coefficients p1, pn, since (see 1.22, Theorem II, III)  The evaluation of a numerical determinant, even of high order, is very quickly accomplished on any modern computer by reduction to triangular form; thus we can find p1 and pn without difficulty.",17
994,"It remains, however, to find p2, p3,…, pn-1.",17
995,2.6.1 Location method,17
996,"In Equation (2.6.1) we arbitrarily assign (n — 2) different values to  ( = 0, which we have in effect used to determine pn) and then evaluate the (numerical) determinant for each of these.",17
997,We then obtain n — 2 linear algebraic equations for the n — 2 unknowns pi.,17
998,A caution should be added: most the arbitrary values of  should preferably lie among the zeros of  (; otherwise inordinately high accuracy may be needed.,17
999,"At this stage, the zeros of  () are now known, but their approximate locations may often be inferred from their sum and product as given by (2.6.6) and (2.6.7).",17
1000,Example 1,17
1001,Let  The sum of the eigenvalues is thus  and their product 3906.25 (=p4).,17
1002,Their arithmetic mean is thus about 11 an the fourth root of  about 8.,17
1003,"These suggest that we might use  = 20,  = 10 in (2.6.1); we have already used  = 0 to obtain .",17
1004,"It is readily found, by condensing the numerical determinants,  Now we know that  or  Insertion of  = 20,  = 10 in (3) together with the numerical values of  (gl}) from (2) yields the two equations  which give p2 = 606.25, p3 = 2812.5.",17
1005,Hence  on factorisation.,17
1006,"The eigenvalues of A are thus 25, 12.5, 5, 2.5.",17
1007,We illustrate the calculation of the eigenvector  corresponding to the eigenvalue 12.5.,17
1008,Then   giving  of which the solution is (any method from 2.5 may be used)  and it is readily checked that these also satisfy the fourth equation.,17
1009,2.6.2 Iteration method,17
1010,"the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, A satisfies its own characteristic equation; i.e.  Postmultiply this by any arbitrary column co and write .",17
1011,Then a computer will rapidly evaluate the successive products  .,17
1012,Accordingly (1) yields  This provided n linear algebraic equations for the n unknowns pi.,17
1013,"As before, we can find  independently if we so wish.",17
1014,"It must be added, however, that this method is not suitable when n is large.",17
1015,"As we shall see later, the columns ci usually tend to proportionality as i increases, Equations (2) become increasingly ill-conditioned; also the numbers involved can assume widely different magnitudes.",17
1016,Example 1,17
1017,We use the matrix A of (2.6.1.1) with co = e4.,17
1018,"It is found that successive columns ci are then   Accordingly,(2) can be written  in agreement with (2.6.1.4).",17
1019,"With the particular choice of co, p4 enters into the last equation only.",17
1020,"Accordingly, if we calculate p1, p4 from the trace and determinant of A, we can discard the last equation and substitute for p1 in the remainder, when (3) reduces to  Any two of these (consistent) equations give p2, p3 their values in (4).",17
1021,2.7 POWER METHODS,17
1022,"The most commonly used device for finding the eigenvalues and vectors of a matrix A is the power method, or one of its many variants, in which A is effectively raised to a high power.",17
1023,We illustrate some aspects of the basic principle.,17
1024,2.7.1 A dominant eigenvalue,17
1025,"Sylvester's expansion for A is (see 1.18), in its simplest form,  and the properties of the constituent matrices ,  Since the order of the terms on the right is immaterial, there is no loss of generality i supposing1 to be the eigenvalue of greatest modulus.",17
1026,"If for the moment we assume it to be real and unrepeated, then all other eigenvalues have smaller moduli.",17
1027,"Thus if r is increased sufficiently, say to a value s, the first term on the right of (2) dominates the rest, which become relatively insignificant.",17
1028,"Then, in the limit,  By use of (3) we thus find both 1 and .",17
1029,"We could in theory find them from As only, since , but there is a practical difficulty.",17
1030,"Unless the  modulus of 1 is close to unity, the numbers appearing in Ar (r large) are either inordinately large or small; in practice therefore it is usual to find not Ar but a matrix proportional to it: at each stage in the power evaluation, a homologous element is reduced to unity.",17
1031,Example 1,17
1032,Let A be the matrix in Equation (2.6.1.1).,17
1033,"Then, if we reduce the bottom right-hand element to unity, we have  We now evaluate B2 and divide through by the bottom right-hand element to obtain  Evaluation of F2/2.4997 repeats F occasional small differences in the fourth decimal place.",17
1034,"Now, if we round off to three decimal places, we find that F can be written as the unit rank matrix, proportional to    If we now revert to A and postmultiply by   Thus, 1 = 25.",17
1035,"Also, the inner product  is  so that normalising to make  unity: Note that  A has been raised fairly rapidly to a high power.",17
1036,An alternative.,17
1037,"There is, however, an alternative device which is in practice more commonly used; this is repeated premultiplication by A of an arbitrary column  as in 2.6.2.",17
1038,We successively evaluate  etc.,17
1039,"If we postmultiply (2) by co and write  (ki is a scalar) we obtain  Accordingly, co is not such that k1 () vanishes, the first term on the right dominates the rest as r increases, until in the limit when r = s ",17
1040,Example 2,17
1041,"We exemplify this using the same matrix A as above; also, we adopt the device of reducing at each stage a homologous element (in this case the bottom element) to unity, beginning with co = e4.",17
1042,"The first step is  Proceeding in this way, we find successive columns as in Table 1.",17
1043,Also given are the dividing factors at each step.,17
1044,"Since c16 repeats c15, they give x1; also the dividing factor 25 is 1.",17
1045,"To complete the solution, we now require to find ; this could be done by repeating the iterative procedure, evaluating , where  is an arbitrary row, or more usually, by the device given in (2.6.4), viz:  giving  We leave it to the reader to show that in this example,(7) leads to  or to a scalar multiple of it.",17
1046,We normalise  in the usual way.,17
1047,"We may note in passing that (as they should) the columns  and  of Table 1 agree with the last columns of B, C, D, E, F (rounding-off errors in the last place of decimals).",17
1048,This leads naturally to a comparison of the two methods.,17
1049,There are two reasons why the second method is commonly used.,17
1050,"First, if an error (even of rounding-off only) is made during the successive squaring process, it is multiplied by itself   subsequently, an persists through the calculations; in the second method, if an error is made in calculating ci, this only amounts to choosing a new arbitrary column, an may prolong the calculations.",17
1051,"But, mainly, the first method usually involves more work than the second.",17
1052,"It is difficult to quantify ""work"" exactly, but if the number of individual multiplications is taken as a guide, then, if A is of order n, each of the n2 elements of  involves n multiplications: i.e. n3 in all.",17

1062,"Again, for the moment we assume the eigenvalues of A to be real and unrepeated; and we assume that in (2.7.1.1) they appear in descending order of modulus.",17
1063,"If, as in 2.7.1 we have found , then Equation (2.7.1.1) can be written  The known matrix on the left now has all the eigenvalues and vectors of A except the first set, and it can be treated as in 2.7.1.",17
1064,"The process of reducing A in this way is known as ""deflation"" .",17
1065,"Evidently the eigenvalue 1 has been replaced by zero, A1 is singular.",17
1066,"Having evaluated A1, we can again apply column iteration.",17
1067,"However, we need not begin with an arbitrary column; we can readily find an appropriate column to begin with, which avoids many iteration steps.",17
1068,An example will make this clear.,17
1069,Example 1,17
1070,We continue Example 2.7.1.1.,17
1071,"The iterations have shown that 1 = 25, while x1 is proportional to{ 1,2,3,5}and  to (1,7,5,4).",17
1072,"Normalising these, we find   Note that  vanishes when premultiplied by .",17
1073,"We now revert to the iterations for 1 an observe that, , c9 of Table 2.7.1.1 is mostly composed of x1.",17
1074,The remainder will clearly be mostly .,17
1075,"Since x1 is orthogonal to , the part of c9 x1 will disappear when it is premultiplied by A1 (see 1))).",17
1076,"Thus we find  and dividing by the last element, we find as a starting column co for iteration with A1   The iterations give us successive columns as in Table 1.",17
1077,"Column c9 repeats c8, 2 = 12.5 and  is proportional to{ -0.5, = -0.5,0,1}.",17
1078,"As before, we now find that  is proportional to (-1, -2,0,1).",17
1079,"Normalising, we find  We proceed to the third eigenvalue; we further deflate A by subtracting the unit rank matrix (3) from A1:  Note that  = 7.5, while  is in fact doubly degenerate; it vanishes when premultiplied by  or .",17
1080,"As before, we choose a column from Table 1 — say c3 ={-0.4978, -0.4992, -0.0015,1}— and apply it as a postmultiplier to .",17
1081,"The result is a column proportional to{ 0.981, 0.0095,— 1.0095, 1}.",17
1082,"We leave it to the reader to show that this leads rapidly to 3 = 5 with x3 proportional to{ 1,0,— 1,1}an that  is then found to be proportional to (27, -11, -15.8).",17
1083,"We normalise this to obtain  an now further deflate A to obtain A3; in this case, as will be seen, no iteration is required to obtain a solution:   In obtaining the last form of(5) we have noted (a) that ; since the other three eigenvalues have been replaced by zeros, 4 = 2.5;(b) A3 is, by inspection, of unit rank an so, with 4 extracted, can be written in the form (5).",17
1084,This completes the solution.,17
1085,"With the four terms of the Sylvester expansion now given numerically in (2),(3),(4) and (5), the whole solution can be expressed compendiously as ",17
1086,2.7.3 Subdominant eigenvalues: sweeping,17
1087,"Although the delation procedure discussed in 2.7.2 is the most straightforward possible method, other devices are often useful and sometimes preferable.",17
1088,"We now discuss ""sweeping"" , which takes two forms.",17
1089,(i) First method,17
1090,"operating with a deflated matrix, we operate on the original matrix A (or a part of it) with a column vector from which all contributions from x1 have been ""swept"" away.",17
1091,"This is valuable, , when (as is often the case in dynamical problems) A is sparse.",17
1092,Deflation destroys this characteristic; the sweeping method under discussion does not.,17
1093,"With r = 0, Equation (2.7.1.5) becomes  Hence if we choose co to make k1 zero, it will contain no contribution from x1, and, as r increases sufficiently to a value s,(2.7.1.5) will tend to  The condition  means that we can express one element of co the remaining n — 1.",17
1094,"In theory, if co is chosen in this way, the iterations will in due course yield (2) without further attention.",17
1095,"In practice, rounding-off errors soon produces inaccuracies which re-introduce small  proportions of x1, which tend to grow relatively rapidly.",17
1096,It is therefore best to apply the criterion  at each step; i.e. to calculate one element of cr from this criterion when the others have been found.,17
1097,This means that we can ignore one row of A; we exemplify this below.,17
1098,"As before, we need not be completely arbitrary i our choice of co (though it must satisfy ) from (1), a column free of x1 is  with co arbitrary.",17
1099,"But we can with advantage choose co to be a column in the previous iteration to find1 etc.: this will contain mostly x1, some , but little else; then  eliminates the contribution from x1.",17
1100,Example 1,17
1101,"We use the same example as before, restating for convenience what we have already found.",17
1102, Note that  have been normalised to give .,17
1103,"Now any postmultiplying column say{ a, b, c, 1}, must satisfy  In performing our iterations, therefore, we may ignore completely the first row of A; we use the last three rows to find the corresponding elements in a column, and then apply(3) to find the top element.",17
1104,"For our initial column co, we again choose the column c9 from Table 2.7.1.1, in the iteration to find 1 etc.; thus for our present purpose  Then  and  As it should, this column vanishes when premultiplied by .",17
1105,"We divide throughout by the last element to obtain as our new starting column  then the iterations, using (3) at each step, begin   We postmultiply A (ignoring its top row) by the column (4) to get the column of three numbers on the right; divide by the last element to get the bottom three elements in the next column, and find the top element from (3).",17
1106,"In this way, we obtain the successive columns and dividing factors in Table 1.",17
1107,Thus we find .,17
1108,"As before, knowing 2, we find  is proportional to (-1, -2,0,1).",17
1109,Normalising:  The same principle serves for the third root.,17
1110,"If cr ={a, b, c, 1}then  and  must both vanish; we find   If we select c3 from Table 1 as our new co, it already excludes x1,  will also exclude .",17
1111,"This is  If this is written{ 0.9333,0.0333,— 1.0333,1}, it satisfies (6).",17
1112,"We now iterate on A, but ignore the first two rows:  We leave it to the reader to show that this converges quickly to 3 = 5, x3 ={1,0, -1,1}.",17
1113,"In the usual way,  is found to be proportional to{ 27, -11, -15.8}.",17
1114,"Normalising:  As before, no iteration is needed for the completion of the solution.",17
1115,"If we choose the last column above (which excludes x1 and ) as a new co, then a column which also excludes x3 is  Since x1, , x3 are excluded, this column is proportional to x4.",17
1116,Premultiplication by a row of A gives 4 = 2.5; completion of the solution is straightforward.,17
1117,(ii) Second method,17
1118,"sweeping our iterated columns at each step, we can do it one for all with the aid of a ""sweeping matrix"" .",17
1119,"(3) we may write  If (8) is used as postmultiplier of A, it is clear that A is deflated by the sweeping matrix in (8) to   (note that A1 here differs from the deflated form A1 of 2.7.2).",17
1120,"If A is of simple form (e.g. sparse) this characteristic may be partly or wholly destroyed in forming A1; on the other hand, A1 has a column of zeros, and thus its own simplicity.",17
1121,"This means also that the umber of the head of a column iteration is always multiplied by zero, an so need not be calculated till the final step.",17
1122,We are thus effectively operating with the third-order submatrix of A1 when its first row and column are omitted.,17
1123,"As before, we may find a suitable initial column (4).",17
1124,"We then perform the iteration, omitting the first element of (4):  The numbers produced in this way reproduced exactly those of the last three elements in the columns of Table 1, the dividing factors; they are exactly the same calculations, but with the matrices associated differently.",17
1125,"At the conclusion, the top element of the final column is found by use of the first row of A1.",17
1126,"We must emphasise, however, that the row vectors A1 are not , .",17
1127,"Hence, when 2 has been found, we revert to A itself to find .",17
1128,"For the next root, we use another sweeping matrix based on the second part of (5):   If this square matrix is used to postmultiply A1 we find  We now iterate on the submatrix  to determine the last two elements of x3; we leave the completion of the solution to the reader.,",17
1129,2.7.4 Shifting and inverse iteration,17
1130,"Theorem IV of 1.22 noted that, the identity  addition of a quantity{ ge}to each of the diagonal elements of A implies the addition of{ ge}to each of the eigenvalues of A. We note here, additionally, that the constituent matrices zii of A are unaltered by such a change.",17
1131,"Sylvester's expansion gives (see 1.18)  whence  The device of adding{ ge}in this way is known as ""shifting"" , and has a variety of uses.",17
1132,", with hindsight, we know that the eigenvalues of A in (2.6.1.1) are 25, 12.5, 5 and 2.5. the rapidity of convergence of the initial power solution depends principally on the relative separation of the eigenvalues 25 and 12.5, i.e. 2:1.",17
1133,"If we reduce all eigenvalues by 7.5, they become 17.5, 5,— 2.5,— 5 and the relative separation is 31/2:1 which yields much quicker convergence.",17
1134,Note that this is the optimum: the second and fourth eigenvalues now have equal moduli.,17
1135,"To select the optimum requires accurate knowledge of the eigenvalues, which at the outset of a calculation is not available; but if one has a general idea of the disposition of the eigenvalues, shifting can save much time.",17
1136,"The principle use of shifting, however, lies in inverse iteration.",17
1137,"Suppose, , that the matrix A is the system matrix of a vibrating mechanical system, and suppose further that this system is excited by a  forcing vibration of frequency corresponding to  = .",17
1138,It is desired to determine the eigenvalue (and its vectors)  to study the response.,17
1139,"To approach this problem, we first note that Sylvester's expansion for negative powers of a matrix B gives  It follows that the eigenvalue of B with the smallest modulus now becomes the eigenvalue of B-1 with largest modulus.",17
1140,"Hence, to solve our problem, we first evaluate B = A — the eigenvalue of A  now becomes the eigenvalue of B nearest zero, i.e. of smallest modulus.",17
1141,"(Note that A, B and B-1 all have the same constituent matrices zii.)",17
1142,We therefore invert B and iterate on B-1 to obtain our solution.,17
1143,Example 1,17
1144,we choose the matrix A defined in (2.6.1.1) and used in previous examples.,17
1145,We also let  = 5.5.,17
1146,"Then  If we invert this, e.g. by the methods of 2.2, we obtain  We postmultiply this by an arbitrary column co: here we choose co = e1 and iterate .",17
1147,The successive columns are given in Table 1.,17
1148,"The iterations converge rapidly to x ={1,0,— 1,1}with the eigenvalue of B-1 equal to -2.",17
1149,"Hence the eigenvalue of B is — 0.5 an of A is 5.5 — 0.5 = 5, results obtained earlier for 3 and x3.",17
1150,"Note that, since the eigenvalues of A are in fact 25, 12.5, 5, 2.5, those of B are 19.5, 7,— 0.5,— 8, and of B-1 therefore 0.0513, 0.1429,— 2,— 0.124.",17
1151,The relative separation of the two roots of largest moduli is here 14:1.,17
1152,"Clearly, the method is not restricted to mechanical systems: by its means we can study the eigenvalues and vectors of any matrix A which lie near any given value o of .",17
1153,"Clearly, the method is not restricted to mechanical systems: by its means we can study the eigenvalues and vectors of any matrix A which lie near any given value o of .",17
1154,2.7.5 Confluent eigenvalues,17
1155,"So far, we have restricted our attention to unrepeated real roots of the characteristic equation belonging to a matrix A; we now consider the case of two equal real roots.",17
1156,"Multiple roots are in practice very rate (except perhaps for mechanical systems moving freely in space, when multiple zero roots can occur: but these have a special simplicity).",17
1157,"The treatment for two roots is readily extended to the multiple case if required: even for two roots, however, we require to examine two cases (see 1.21).",17
1158,"We assume the roots to have dominant moduli, any roots of greater modulus having been removed by deflation etc.",17
1159,(i) Characteristic matrix doubly degenerate,17
1160,"When a repeated eigenvalue 1 makes the characteristic matrix doubly degenerate, we know (see (1.21.14)) that the Sylvester expansion of the system matrix A is  It follows that we can use the power method to find 1; postmultiplication by co gives in the limit, when r is sufficiently large, say s,  We thus find 1 without difficulty; but the determination of z11 + z22 requires further consideration.",17
1161,"Now   and  is thus, a linear combination of 1, .",17
1162,"At this point, the iteration has given no indication that a double root is involved; however, this becomes apparent when we seek the row vector corresponding to cs: for all first minors of 1I — A vanish and we cannot find a unique row vector.",17
1163,"To proceed, it is simplest to generalise (2.6.4) by partitioning off the last two rows and columns of 1I — A, thus:  Here  is a square submatrix of order  of order 2;  has two columns and  has two rows.",17
1164,Then  These algebraic equations are solved for ; we now have two independent columns  which annihilate 1I — A when used as postmultipliers; and correspondingly for the rows .,17
1165,"We now normalise them; we evaluate  Then m is a square matrix of order 2 and, ,  are normalised rows and columns.",17
1166,Finally  Note that only the sum  is unique.,17
1167,If they are individually expressed as  and  then their sum can be written  where M is an arbitrary non-singular matrix of order 2.,17
1168,"This replaces x1,  with two different linear combinations (x1, ) M of them, with corresponding changes for .",17
1169,It will be observed that in this approach we have not used cs (which we have already found); its introduction would spoil the simplicity of (2).,17
1170,"When x1,  have been found, it is possible to check that cs is a linear combination of them.,",17
1171,Example 1,17
1172,Consider the matrix   It is assumed that at this stage we have no knowledge of its eigenvalues.,17
1173,"If we choose  and iterate in the usual way, we find quite quickly that  Normally, we would choose  However, if we attempt to use (2.6.4) to find , it emerges that all first minors of 1I- A vanish, indicating that 1 = 12.5 is a repeated root.",17
1174,"We therefore apply (2) with  This gives for the solution of (2)  Since the columns and rows are arbitrary to a scalar multiplier, we may now write  (for simplicity of exposition we have multiplied the first column on the right by 3).",17
1175,"The product of the numerical matrices in (8), in that order, is (see (3))  If we premultiply  we ca finally write  These enable us to choose, if they are required,  but, following (5), we could equally well use any two different linear combinations o x1, , represented by (x1, ) M provided these are associated with ., /div4.",17
1176,(ii) Characteristic matrix simply degenerate,17
1177,This case is rather more difficult: the difficulty derives from the appearance of a unit in the superdiagonal of the spectral matrix of the given matrix A. For simplicity of exposition we assume here that A is of order 4: extension to larger matrices is obvious.,17
1178,"We know (see 1.21) that ,   on expansion of the triple product.",17
1179,"We know further that, the properties of the constituent matrices zij,  When  is absent, this reverts to the simpler case dealt with under (i).",17
1180,"Our task now is, given A, to resolve it numerically into one of the forms (12), i.e. to find 1 etc.",17
1181,"Sine, , we do not know the nature of A, we should approach this task by iteration with A on an arbitrary column co.",17
1182,"If we write  then postmultiplication of (13) by co yields  When the iterations have proceeded so far, say when r = s, that contributions from 3, 4 are insignificant and may be neglected, then   Previously, with  absent, at this stage  equalled .",17
1183,"Now, the last term, this is true and successive columns tend to show a near arithmetical progression in their elements.",17
1184,"It is true that, when s is very large  the columns tend ultimately to x1 (last term in cs dominant), but the number of iterations required is very large.",17
1185,"However, the simple  we can drive from (15) the relation  In practice, therefore, if convergence seems very slow, we evaluate three successive columns fully, omitting the reduction of a homologous element to unity, and solve the quadratic  for two homologous elements.",17
1186,"If they have a common root, we test the remaining quadratics to see if they are satisfied by this common root.",17
1187,"If they re, then the root is 1 and the iterations have proceeded far enough (r = s) for only terms in 1 to remain.",17
1188,Knowing 1 we use (15) to evaluate  giving us a column proportional to x1.,17
1189,"Knowing 1, we now form the matrix 1I — A; if we put r = 0,1 in (13), multiply the first by 1 and then subtract the second:  Premultiplication of this by , or postmultiplication by x1, annihilates it; none of the other vectors does so: the matrix is rendered simply degenerate by the presence of z12.",17
1190,"We may, however, use (2.6.4) to find , we then known 1 and  scalar multipliers.",17
1191,"To find  we revert to (11), which yield, ,  or  Since 1I — A is simply degenerate, the last equations provide, , n — 1 independent linear equations for  (and ).",17
1192,"However, one element in each of these vectors may be assigned arbitrarily.",17
1193,"For, since (1I — A) x1 vanishes, the equation for  is also satisfied by , where q is arbitrary; so, , if we choose a non-zero element in , the homologous element in  may be made zero by appropriate choice of 1.",17
1194,Similar considerations apply for .,17
1195,We are thus able to solve (19) for  and .,17
1196,"Having done this, we now require to normalise: we evaluate  and we may then choose our vectors as, , ,  and the pair  which we now call .",17
1197,"We have now obtained 1 the vectors  and , and the auxiliary vectors  and ; we are therefore in a position to deflate A (see (12)) by removing all contributions from these quantities.",17
1198,The solution is then completed in the usual way.,17

1201,"If we choose co = e4, then after about 18 steps, four successive columns are  These show very slow convergence; indeed, the elements show a near-arithmetical progression.",17
1202,"We therefore choose, say, the first of these columns and without reducing the last element to unity, calculate the next two columns:  We choose, say, the first and last elements of these and solve   The common root 12.5 also satisfies the middle two quadratics; hence we find 1 = 12.5.",17
1203,"We now use (17) and find{ 2.2875, 4.6875, 7.5, 13.125}— 12.5{ 0.165, 0.355, 0.57,1}={0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.625}and hence  may be taken as{ 1,2,3,5}.",17
1204,Using (21) we now evaluate  and it may be checked that postmultiplication by  gives a null product.,17
1205,"We use (22) as in (2.6.4) to find , we leave the solution to the reader: it is found that  which when used to premultiply (22), annihilates it.",17
1206,We now proceed to find the auxiliary vectors.,17
1207,"If we write  (the first element of  is nonzero, of  may be taken as zero) then we solve, using the appropriate submatrices (see(19))  The solution is .",17
1208,A similar calculation yields .,17
1209,We must now normalise these.,17
1210,"We evaluate  Note that here, since the second row and first column of the product are necessarily orthogonal, m is triangular; also in this case it happens that m-1 = m.",17
1211,"Accordingly, we may choose to retain the columns  and to adopt the rows, orthogonal to , ,   We are now able to evaluate  and  We can now deflate A (see (21)) to  Note that trA1 = 7.5; also A1 is doubly degenerate, being annihilated by postmultiplication by both  and .",17
1212,"Iteration with A1 on co = e4 produces quite quickly the simple eigenvalue 3 = 5 and vector x3 ={1,0, -1,1}.",17
1213,We then evaluate 5I — A1 and employ (2.6.4) to obtain .,17
1214,"Normalising this with x3, we obtain  and we are now able to deflate A further to   Since  and  is the only remaining eigenvalue,  and  can be written  which completes the solution.",17

1219,"So far, we have restricted our studies to real eigenvalues.",17
1220,"However, complex eigenvalues and vectors are of frequent  , and require special consideration.",17
1221,"First, if the matrix is real, then its characteristic equation must have real coefficients.",17
1222,"Hence, if it is satisfied by , then it will also be satisfied by ; complex eigenvalues of a real matrix therefore occur in conjugate pairs.",17
1223,"In a similar way, if the eigenvector corresponding to  is , then the relation  implies the conjugate relation; hence p — iq is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue ",17
1224,"Evidently, the vector in (1) is arbitrary to a scalar complex multiplier, say  +  another vector satisfying (1) is thus  Any arbitrary linear combination of p and q may therefore be taken as the real part of the vector, with a corresponding combination for the imaginary part.",17
1225,If we expand (1) we obtain successively  If we eliminate q we find   The same equation is satisfied by q.,17
1226,"This suggests that the square matrix in it is doubly degenerate and that p, q can each have two arbitrary elements; but this is not so.",17
1227,"When  p are known, q is uniquely related to p by  in which  is not singular.",17
1228,What is said above gives a background to what follows.,17
1229,"We assume than  have dominant moduli, any eigenvalues of greater moduli having been removed by deflation etc.",17
1230,"Again, , we assume nothing is known of the nature of A, the process of finding the dominant eigenvalue and its vector is approached by iterating with A on an arbitrary column co.",17
1231,", for simplicity, we assume A to be of order 4.",17
1232,"The Sylvester expansion of A gives  Accordingly, if we perform the usual iteration on co and continue until, with r = s, terms in 3 and 4 are negligible.",17
1233, where  is a complex scalar.,17
1234,"Now, as we have seen (p + iq) is arbitrary to a complex scalar multiplier (and p — iq similarly).",17
1235,"We are therefore at liberty to choose  and then  Elimination of p, 1 from these three equations yields  Note that, since  this is precisely the same as Equation (3); however, in the iteration case, it is only true when the iterations have proceeded sufficiently far for the terms in 3, 4 to disappear, when cs consists only of p.",17
1236,"Now in practice, with a pair of complex eigenvalues, the elements in  tend to change sign periodically: there is no point in reducing a homologous element to unity, since there is no convergence to a settled form.",17

1245,"For since  belong to different eigenvalues, they are orthogonal, and   For the process of normalisation, we require to evaluate  and m is evidently diagonal; the check equations (9) it can be written  the determinant of which is , so its reciprocal is readily written down and we can obtain normalised forms of .",17
1246,We can now deflate A. Since  a deflated matrix A1 is  We can therefore use A1 to obtain the remaining eigenvalues and vectors of A in the usual way.,17
1247,Example 1,17
1248,"Let  If we use this for iterative premultiplication of an arbitrary column, say the summing vector, successive columns are as show in Table 1.",17
1249, It is apparent from the first that the vector elements are changing sign; so we do not reduce a homologous element to unity (though we might periodically remove a power of 10).,17
1250,"If, starting say at c5, we test to see if pairs of homologous elements give consistent values for ,  in (7), we find  this is not so.",17
1251,"However,  give nearly consistent values; we therefore begin with  accurately:  If these three columns are used in (7) then any two pairs of homologous elements give .",17
1252,"We thus obtain  Also, we may now choose  and using the second of Equations (6) we now find  We now have to find , and for this we use (8).",17
1253,"One element of  can be arbitrarily assigned: here we assign the value 1 to the third element and solve  which, if we omit one column (e.g. the last) from the square matrix, gives  We omit the details of solution; the answer is   Note that  Accordingly,  and if we postmultiply p + iq as given by (14) and (15) my m-1 we obtain as our normalised p, q,  We are now able to deflate A. Equation (11) becomes, with A given by (12) and use of (13),(14),(15) and (16),  A1 is, in fact, doubly degenerate; it is annihilated by both the columns immediately above it.",17
1254,iteration with A1 on an arbitrary column quickly leads to the result  Further delation leads to  which completes the solution.,17
1255,2.7.7 Adjacent eigenvalues: Two eigenvalues with nearly-equal moduli,17
1256,"When two eigenvalues have nearly-equal moduli, it is obvious that very many iterations will be required for a direct solution.",17
1257,The following device can be helpful in this case.,17
1258,Suppose the iterations have proceeded so far that only contributions from the two nearly-equal eigenvalues remain.,17
1259,"Then we can write, when a homologous element is not made unity,  Here a, b, c, d; p, q are the values of a homologous element in the various columns; a, b, c, d are known.",17
1260,"Elimination of p, q, yields two equations which may be solved for 1 + 2 and 12:  Hence, ,  are readily found.",17
1261,"When they are known, then  which follow from the first two of Equations (1).",17
1262,"When 1, 2 are very close, both numerator and denominator in (2) tend to be small differences, accurate calculation of a, b, c, d is desirable.",17
1263,"In practice, iteration in this case behaves rather like that for a defective matrix (2.7.5), in that convergence is slow and successive columns tend to a quasi-arithmetic progression of the elements.",17
1264,"The occurrence of nearly-equal roots is more common than that of a defective matrix; hence tests to see whether homologous elements yield, in (2), consistent results should be applied first when convergence is slow.",17
1265, ,17
1266,Example 1,17
1267," Iteration on a column, beginning with co = e4, yields successive columns as given in Table 1.",17
1268,"At this stage, we make consecutive accurate calculations, to see if we can get consistent values for :  Using the elements of the last line in (2) we obtain  The elements of the first line give  The results are consistent, as indeed are the results from the second and third lines.",17
1269,By inspection (or from the implied quadratic)  We now evaluate the eigenvectors:  we may take  I now remains to find the corresponding row vectors and to deflate A for  further study; we leave this to the reader.,17
1270,"However, we may note here that  whence .",17
1271,2.7.8 Applicability of power methods,17
1272,"We have seen that the power method can be used to obtain dominant eigenvalues and the associated vectors, and, by deflation, sweeng, shifting and inverse iteration, can also be used to find all non-dominant eigenvalues and their vectors; the results are obtained seriatim.",17
1273,"This implies that, if one is interested only in a limited number of eigenvalues, the power method is the obvious choice.",17
1274,", suppose we have a mathematical model with n = 100 for study of the vibration characteristics of an aircraft.",17
1275,"The aeroelastic engineer will usually be interested only in the fundamental mode of vibration and a few overtones, say 10 in all; in the usual model this implies the dominant and the 9 immediately subdominant eigenvalues and vectors.",17
1276,"The vibration engineer will be concerned with a band of frequencies near the engine rotational speed, and so will use shifting and inverse iteration.",17
1277,"But in any event, the mathematical model will usually involve the finite element concept which gives accurate values for the lower band of frequencies, but is often quite unrepresentative of the top frequencies.",17
1278,Evaluation of all frequencies and modes is therefore not normally required.,17
1279,"For such a model, power methods are the obvious choice.",17
1280,"However, if interest attaches to all eigenvalues, and if there is less concern with the associated vectors, other methods may be used.",17
1281,We now begin a brief study of transformation methods.,17
1282,2.8 TRANSFORMATION METHODS,17
1283,"In these methods, we apply a succession of similar transformations to a matrix A:  , until A is transformed into a form giving the eigenvalues directly: it may be a triangular form, or the ultimate canonical form  (or  if A is defective).",17
1284,"Since the transformations are similar, all the derived matrices B, C, D,…have the same eigenvalues as A; and if we proceed to the diagonal form, then the chain product X3…gives the modal matrix X.",17
1285,2.8.1 Jacobi's method for a real symmetric matrix,17
1286,"In 1.22, Theorems VIII and X, we have shown that a real symmetric matrix  has real eigenvalues and that it cannot be defective.",17
1287,"Moreover, its modal matrix is orthogonal; hence  Jacobi's method is as follows.",17
1288,"We begin by searching the off-diagonal elements of A (since A is symmetrical, we usually use the upper half only) to find the element Auv of greatest modulus.",17
1289,"We then construct the orthogonal matrix , which is the unit matrix the units in the (u, u) and (v, v) positions are each replaced by  and the zeros in the (u, v) and (v, u) positions by  and s respectively.",17
1290,Then  and we may evaluate  of which the relevant submatrix is (omitting all other rows and columns)  which yields  We now choose{ gth}1 Buv vanishes; i.e.  This fixed{ gth}1.,17
1291,"If than 2{gth}1 is positive, we take 2{gth}1 to lie in the first quadrant; if negative, in the fourth, Then{ gth}1 lies between  = c is positive and  has the sign of tan 2{gth}1.",17
1292,"With c, s fixed, we can now evaluate B fully.",17
1293,"Elements in the uth, vth columns and rows are unaltered from those in A; at the intersections of the uth, vth columns an rows the new elements are given by (3)(with Buv = 0), while the remaining elements Biu, Biv in the uth, vth columns and rows are  We may make two deductions.",17
1294,"First, from (3) we have  and since only these diagonal elements have changed, it follows that  as it must in a similar transformation.",17
1295,"Next, fro(5), squaring  and adding, we have  and since only the uth, vth columns and rows have changed, we deduce that the sum of the squares of all the off-diagonal elements of B is less than that of A since we have replaced the two elements Auv of A by zeros in B. Thus  Having evaluated B, we repeat the procedure to find C; we select the element Bpq of largest modulus and find  from (see 4))  we then proceed as before to construct  and .",17
1296,C will have Cpq = 0 and may also have cuv = 0 (if ); but this situation will not persist.,17
1297,"At some stage, , elements formerly made zero will again become nonzero, though usually smaller than before.",17
1298,"Thus Jacobi's method does not terminate in a finite, predictable number of steps; indeed, the umber may be very large.",17
1299,"Nevertheless, following (6)  and, in an overall sense, the off-diagonal elements therefore become progressively smaller, until eventually we obtain a matrix in which the off-diagonal elements are all vanishingly small: i.e. a diagonal matrix of which the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues.",17
1300,"We give below an example, but must enter the caveat that its small order (n = 3) it converges radly.",17
1301,"At each stage, the sum of the squares of the off-diagonal elements decreases by one third.",17
1302,"However, if we had a matrix of order 100, it would have 9900 off-diagonal elements, and we can only say that at each stage the sum of the squares of these elements would decrease by 1/4950 ; convergence to diagonal form is likely to take very much longer than for a small matrix.",17
1303,We may add two observations.,17
1304,"The method is viable if Auv is reduced, not to zero, but to some lesser modulus; nevertheless, reduction to zero is obviously best.",17
1305,"Also, the method requires only that A is real and symmetric: its state of definiteness is irrelevant.",17
1306,"In the example below, A has a negative eigenvalue.",17
1307,Example 1,17
1308,Let  We select the off-diagonal element of largest modulus (underlined) and evaluate (we record only six decimal places)  Hence  and then  Note that  also  thus we have effected a considerable overall reduction.,17
1309,"The second step is to obtain C. For this we select the underlined element in B an evaluate in succession   and then  Note that the zero elements in B have become nonzero in C; however,  is now 2.19132; compare  above.",17
1310,"Proceeding in this way, after six transformations, we find to the order of accuracy employed ",17
1311,2.8.2 The LR and QR methods,17
1312,"We now describe briefly two methods which are applicable to any square matrix A, whether symmetric or not, real or complex, simple or defective, non-singular or singular.",17
1313,"Here, we shall merely state and illustrate the methods; for proofs, readers are referred to Wilkinson (6).",17
1314,"We may note, however, that while a complex matrix A = B + iC (B, C real) may be treated as such, using complex arithmetic, it is more usual to treat its real equivalent  which (see Theorem XI, 1.22) yields the eigenvalues and vectors of A and its conjugate.",17
1315,2.8.3 The LR algorithm,17
1316,"It is a straightforward process, readily programmed for a computer, to resolve a matrix A into the product L1R1 where L1 is a lower triangular matrix having units in its diagonal, and R1 is an upper triangular matrix.",17
1317,"For a model, we here take n = 4; it is tycal of any order.",17
1318,"Let    the top row of  which by inspection is identical with that of A, we have here 12 equations ad 12 unknowns.",17
1319,"From the first column of the product we have  which determine p, q, r.",17
1320,"The second column yields  which, with p,.",17
1321,"q, r known, determine in succession 2, s, t.",17
1322,"The remaining unknowns 3, x33, n and the last column of R1 are found progressively in the same way.",17
1323,"Note, however, that A11, 2, x33,…are divisors (vots) in this procedure, a voting strategy may be needed.",17
1324,"Note also that , so ; hence, if A is non-singular, the diagonal elements of R1 must all be nonzero.",17
1325,"Indeed, this program is very suitable for the numerical evaluation of determinants.",17
1326,"The  algorithm resolves A into the product  as above, and then multiplies the factors in reverse order to obtain a new matrix B. Since  and then  is a similar transform of A. B is, , a fully populated matrix of which the last column is that of R1 (thus A14 reappears in B) and the last row that of L1 multiplied by x44.",17
1327,"When B is found, it is in turn resolved into the product L2R2 and  evaluated, .",17
1328,"As the succession of similar transforms proceeds, it is found that (a) the elements below the diagonal become progressively smaller,(b) the diagonal elements tend to the eigenvalues, in descending order or modulus down the diagonal.",17
1329,"When the process is well established, it is found that (with n = 4 as our model) the element  becomes approximately  in .",17
1330,When this element becomes very small  tends to decrease by the factor  and  by  .,17
1331,"Accordingly, if the eigenvalues of A are widely spaced, convergence of the  method is fairly rad; if, however, there is a pair or group of nearly-equal eigenvalues, then very many iterations may be required before the end result is achieved.",17
1332,"This is an upper triangular matrix T, of which the diagonal elements are the(real) eigenvalues in descending order of modulus, and which still retains the  element A14 in the top right position.",17
1333,"If A has a pair of conjugate complex eigenvalues, then T is not strictly upper triangular: the diagonal includes a block of order 2  with  on the diagonal of T and  below it.",17
1334,"In this case, the solution of  yields the complex eigenvalues.",17
1335,"the numbers,  not constant under transformation; but if the iterations have proceeded so far that I is in the quasi-triangular form, the trace and determinant of (3) are invariant, the complex roots are fixed.",17
1336,"As the LR transformations proceed, the most rad convergence is to the smallest eigenvalue in the bottom right-hand corner.",17
1337,"Indeed, if there is a zero eigenvalue, it appears in the first transformation, i.e. in B. It follows that shifting (see 2.7.4) can be used with great advantage to accelerate convergence.",17
1338,"When the element in the bottom right-hand corner has reached a settled value (i.e. the eigenvalue), we can deflate the transform, by omission of its last row and column, before continuing the iterations with a matrix of reduced order., /div4.",17
1339,Example 1,17
1340,"We choose the deflated matrix i (2.7.2.2) as A:  Since , the bottom right-hand element of  vanishes, as it should.",17
1341,"We now evaluate the product in reverse order:  The reader is invited to check that, if B is resolved as it stands into  then C =  will also have its last row null, the zero eigenvalue thus repeating.",17
1342,"We may therefore deflate B, omitting its last row and column and continue the iterations with the leading first minor of B. It is found that, after 22 more iterations, working to six decimal places,  Thus, the eigenvalues of A are, in descending order of modulus, 12.5, 5.0, 2.5, 0.",17
1343,"The whole operation may in fact be summarised as LT = AL:  Recovery of the eigenvectors in the LR procedure is not straightforward, especially if deflation has been used.",17
1344,"Since the eigenvalues are known, probably the simplest method is to use (2.6.4).",17
1345,"However, if we have not deflated, then clearly  leads to (see (5) above)   We now require to transform T to .",17
1346,"If TP = PA, then tycally  where PA has been multiplied out.",17
1347,"Identification of the elements on each side, beginning with the superdiagonal, leads to  giving a, d, f.",17
1348,"The remaining unknowns, b, e, c are found progressively.",17
1349,"With P determined in this way, we have  the modal matrix of A is the product LP.",17
1350,"The reader is invited to evaluate LP, using the numerical values of (5) in (6), and to note that the eigenvector belonging to the zero root is that originally associated with the eigenvalues 25 in (2.7.2.6)",17
1351,The LR procedure is thus simple and easily programmed.,17
1352,"However, in practice, it normally requires very many iterations before convergence is achieved; moreover, the process of recovering eigenvectors outlined above is apt to be ill-conditioned, and some other procedure is usually to be preferred.",17
1353,2.8.4 Pre-reduction to upper Hessenberg form,17
1354,"As we have seen, the LR procedure (and the QR method, to be discussed shortly) annihilates the elements of A below the diagonal.",17
1355,"This is, however, usually a very long process; and while it can be accelerated by shifting and deflation, it is in fact better to depopulate A below the diagonal, as far as possible, as an initial step.",17
1356,An upper Hessenberg matrix has only zeros below its infradiagonal; and it is possible to transform any matrix A to this form by a similar transformation.,17
1357,"This is the best that can be done to depopulate a matrix below its diagonal; if one could remove infradiagonal elements , there would be no problem in finding eigenvalues and vectors of a matrix.",17
1358,We illustrate reduction to upper Hessenberg form with a general matrix of order 4; it is clear that the procedure applies to matrices of any order greater than 2.,17
1359,"We  write AK = KH as  Just as we have done earlier, we can evaluate the n2 unknowns progressively.",17
1360,"The first column of the product gives  which determine h11, h21, p, q (note that here, also, a voting strategy may be needed).",17
1361,From the second column  which yield in succession  .,17
1362,"Thus, by progressive substitution, we arrive at the Hessenberg matrix ; it possesses the same eigenvalues as A. If we apply the LR or QR algorithms to H, the Hessenberg form is retained at each step; thus, removing all the elements below the diagonal, we have to remove only those in the infradiagonal.",17
1363,Much computer arithmetic and time is thus saved.,17
1364,"Transformation of A to H therefore greatly improves the LR algorithm; we have introduced it here, however, because for the QR method it is a .",17
1365,"We may add here, in passing, that it is possible by simple substitutions to reduce any matrix A to tridiagonal form — populated only in the superdiagonal, diagonal and infradiagonal.",17
1366,"However, for our present purposes this is unnecessary; and in any event it often involves ill-conditioned equations and so lacks accuracy.",17
1367,Example 1,17
1368,We again choose the matrix A of (2.8.3.4).,17
1369,"The reader is invited to check that, if A is transformed as in (1), then  If we now treat H as our basic starting matrix A and resolve it into L1R1 then  As will be seen from , resolution of an upper Hessenberg matrix requires an upper Hessenberg L1, i.e. a matrix with zero elements everywhere except in the diagonal and infradiagonal.",17
1370,Both the resolution of A into L1R1 and the subsequent evaluation of  (B is also of upper Hessenberg form) are thus much simpler than when A is fully populated.,17
1371,2.8.5 The QR algorithm,17
1372,We assume that the matrix A is already in upper Hessenberg form.,17
1373,"Then, in parallel with the LR algorithm, we write  where , as before, is upper triangular.",17
1374,"However, here we do not resolve A into  instead, we require that  shall be a orthogonal matrix:  Thus  is our similar transformation of A into B. We then transform B into C:  , until the transform is eventually an upper triangular matrix having the eigenvalues of A in its diagonal.",17
1375,It remains to explain how Qi is chosen.,17
1376,There are various possibilities; the most popular methods are those of Givens and Householder (6).,17
1377,"Here we describe Givens' method; and as before, for simplicity of exposition, we choose n = 4.",17
1378,"Let the matrix, pre-reduced to upper Hessenberg form, be  Also, let  where .",17
1379,"Then if we evaluate  as a chain, beginning by premultiplying A by the last of the three matrices in (4), and if also we take  then A is first replaced by a matrix in which the leading element of the infradiagonal vanishes.",17
1380,"The top two rows of A are altered; , 2 is replaced by .",17
1381,In the next multiplication we take  and then the second element in the infradiagonal vanishes.,17
1382,"Finally, with A33 now altered to  we put  and complete the chain.",17
1383,The result is the upper triangular matrix R1.,17
1384,"We now have to complete the similar transformation by postmultiplying by Q1; the result,  is again of upper Hessenberg form.",17
1385,We now repeat the cycle to obtain  .,17
1386,"As before, it is found that the infradiagonal elements become smaller at each step until the similar transform of A is ultimately upper triangular (or quasi-triangular if A has complex eigenvalues); i.e. a matrix T given by  The following point is important.",17
1387,"In our treatment above, B is the product of a chain of seven matrices.",17
1388,"When the multiplications are carried out in the order indicated, the upper Hessenberg form is maintained throughout, If, however, we begin by multiplying the central three matrices, the upper Hessenberg form is lost, with a accompanying loss of simplicity.",17
1389,It is now apparent why A must be pre-reduced to upper Hessenberg form.,17
1390,Equation (4) employs one matrix for each nonzero element below the diagonal — three in this case; n — 1 .,17
1391,There are thus 2n — 2 multiplications in each iteration.,17
1392,"But if A were fully populated, the number of multiplications would be n (n — 1).",17
1393,Example 1,17
1394,The reader is invited to work through this example; we avoid repetitive labour by the use of hindsight.,17
1395,"Consider the matrix defined in (2.7.6.12) and reduce it, as in (2.8.4.1), to upper Hessenberg form.",17
1396,"The result is a new matrix  We now, with hindsight, use a shift of 0.2; i.e. we work with the matrix A — 0.2I.",17
1397,Shifts are always used to improve convergence: this particular shift requires only one step.,17
1398,"The matrix is now  and after the six multiplications implied (see (4)) in  it becomes   Thus A — 0.2I has a zero eigenvalue; we recover B by adding 0.2I and can then deflate and consider the reduced matrix  , to avoid repetitive labour in the example, we use hindsight: we now apply a shift of 0.4 and consider  We require only one step (four multiplications) to reduce this to  We now recover  by adding 0.4I and deflate by omission of the last row and column:  In any similar transform of  the trace and determinant are unaltered.",17
1399,"The two eigenvalues of  are thus determined by  The required eigenvalues are thus 0.2 (bottom right-hand element of B), 0.4 (bottom right-hand element of ) and .",17
1400,"The convergence properties of the QR algorithm are superior to those of LR, particularly when shifts are used and deflation is performed whenever possible.",17
1401,"If complex eigenvalues exist,""double shifts' (see Wilkinson (6)) may be made and two QR steps performed simultaneously to give rapid convergence while all arithmetic is kept real.",17
1402,The QR method is thus very powerful and of quite general applicability; it is probably the most popular technique on modern main-frame computers for the evaluation of  eigenvalues of non-symmetric matrices.,17
1403,"On the other hand, recovery of eigenvectors, though possible, is very difficult and often inaccurate, and some quite different routine (e.g. (2.6.4), when the eigenvalues have been found by QR) is recommended.,",17
1404,2.9 MATRIX PENCILS,17
1405,"Our discussion of this toc is very limited, though we look again at the subject, also briefly, in 2.10.",17
1406,2.9.1 Eigenvalues and vectors of matrix pencils,17
1407,"Any lambda-matrix of the form C — B, which can be rectangular, *is described as a matrix pencil (see 1.15).",17
1408,"If C is square, of order n, and non-singular, the pencil is described as regular, since in the polynomial equation obtained by expansion of  the coefficient  which does not vanish, there are n eigenvalues i which satisfy (1).",17
1409,It is clear that these eigenvalues belong also to the matrix .,17
1410,"For each root i there will be one linear relation between the columns of the pencil, we may write  and  is an eigenvector of the pencil.",17
1411,"The pencil is described as simple if there are n independent vectors  we may write the set compendiously as  where  is of simple diagonal form, even through it may include multiple roots.",17
1412,"If, on the other hand, one or more auxiliary vectors are required, the spectral matrix takes the form , then the pencil is defective.",17
1413,", a pencil is simple if B, C are real and symmetric and if C is pos. def.",17
1414,This proposition is proved in Corollary 1 of Theorem X of 1.22.,17
1415,"However, it does not follow that if B, C are real and symmetric, the pencil is simple, or its roots real.",17
1416,"The reader is invited to study the two pencils  Pencil (i) is real and symmetric; it has two equal eigenvalues  = 1 and the spectral matrix is of elementary Jordan block form; it is defective, with only the single eigenvector{ 2,1}.",17
1417,"Pencil (ii) also has real, symmetric coefficients; but its eigenvalues are , with independent vectors{ 1,1 + 1}and {1,1 -i}.",17
1418,It is thus simple.,17
1419,"In both (i) and (ii),  is negative, and so C is not pos. def. (see 1.22, Theorem X).",17
1420,"If B, C are real and symmetric, and if C is pos. def. then as in Theorem VIII of 1.22, the eigenvalues are real and finite and the eigenvectors real.",17
1421,"We ow restrict our attention to simple pencils, where symmetric or not.",17
1422,"In parallel with (2) we have the equation  and this leads to the counterpart of(3)  Postmultiply this by X and use (3); then  For simplicity, let us now suppose all roots i to be distinct.",17
1423,"Then  permutes with a diagonal matrix and is therefore itself diagonal:  But (see (3)) is arbitrary to a postmultiplying diagonal matrix; we may thus write  and then from (5)  In the special case where B, C are symmetric, we may evidently identify Y with X.",17
1424,So much for the elementary properties of pencils.,17
1425,We turn ow to their numerical treatment.,17
1426,"First, if we have a simple pencil C — B, we may premultiply it by C-1 to obtain I — A, A = C-1B; we may then obtain the eigenvalues and vectors of the pencil by applying any of the methods of 2.6–2.8 to A, and often this is the simplest procedure.",17
1427,"However, cases can arise where this is not the best approach.",17
1428,", suppose C to be tridiagonal and B diagonal.",17
1429,"Then C-1 is fully populated, and so would be C-1B; the simplicity of the pencil is thus lost in A. The same is true when C, B are sparse.",17
1430,"We now give an example in which C, B are sparse and symmetric.",17
1431,"The reader is invited to study this closely, since it illustrates more than the possible treatment of a pencil.",17
1432,Example 1,17
1433,Consider the pencil  here C is tridiagonal and symmetric; B is diagonal.,17
1434,Also (though this is immaterial for our present purpose) both are centrosymmetric.,17
1435,The pencil thus has particular simplicity as it stands.,17
1436,"We re required to find the eigenvalues i which satisfy , and the corresponding vectors.",17
1437,"First, if we attempt this evaluating A = C-1B we find  Thus A is fully populated and is not symmetric (though, as it must, it remains centrosymmetric).",17
1438,We therefore return to the original form (8).,17
1439,A possible way of dealing with this is to use the location method (see 2.6.1).,17
1440,"If we write  then  (since P is of order 4); we therefore require to assign three arbitrary values to  and then, by simple triangulation, evaluate  for each of these.",17
1441,"Since the product of the roots is , we may choose  = 2, 1,— 1 as reasonable arbitrary values.",17
1442,"Then we find, using a typical direct triangulation  while .",17
1443,"Fortuitously, we have found one of the zeros of.",17
1444,"Disregarding this for the moment, we write   and use the above values; we find  the solution of which is .",17
1445,"Hence  or  To find the zeros of  () we may, , use the companion matrix (see 1.16), which, in this example, is  the eigenvalues of which are the zeros of (10).",17
1446,"We may find these in the usual way by iteration: we repeatedly premultiply an arbitrary column, say , by M. Successive columns are then given by Table 1.",17
1447,"We observe that, the particular form of M, we need calculate only the top element of each column, in this table; the remaining elements are those of the previous column, one step down.",17
1448,"In fact, we re only solving the regression formula   which is equivalent to the iteration with M; this is in effect Bernoulli's method of solution of  () = 0.",17
1449,"To six places of decimals, we have now found 1 — 6.464102.",17
1450,Hence  on extraction of the first factor.,17
1451,"If we set up a regression formula (or companion matrix) for the cubic, we find the next factor to be ( + 1), as we have already noted.",17
1452,In face  the eigenvalues are .,17
1453,We now look briefly at the eigenvectors.,17
1454,Typically  which is singular.,17
1455,"We treat it by the method of Equation (2.6.4), using the first three rows, to obtain with x4 =1,  we find .",17
1456,"In this way, with the eigenvalues in order of modulus, we find  A point of interest may be noted: the individual vectors are either centrosymmetric or centroskew, just as a symmetric structure has either symmetric or antisymmetric modes of vibration.",17
1457,We leave it to the reader to check that (see (3))   and also that  are diagonal.,17
1458,"To complete this discussion, we may observe that the companion matrix, or its equivalent — the regression formula, may be used to find complex roots of a determinantal equation (see 1.7.6).",17
1459,", suppose we find  Then we may set up the regression formula  and if we begin with , we find for successive values of   The periodic change of sign, with no settled ratio, indicates complex roots.",17
1460,We therefore apply Equation (2.7.6.7) to the last 4 figures in sequences of 3 (we assume contributions from the other roots to be vanishingly small):  which give us .,17
1461,Hence (13) has the factor ; and we may write  all he factors of (13) are complex.,17
1462,2.9.2 Deflation of a matrix pencil,17
1463,The eigenvalues and vectors of a simple pencil (not necessarily symmetric) will satisfy  Write these as  then  are evidently the eigenvectors belonging to the eigenvalue i of C-1B.,17
1464,"If we normalise them  then Sylvester expansion of C-1B (see 1.18) is  we may express B C, etc., as   Now suppose that we have found .",17
1465,"Then we are able to evaluate, on the left-hand side,  and evidently a new pencil, which has all the eigenvalues and vectors of the original pencil 1 is replaced by 0, is  This is Lancaster's deflation formula.",17
1466,"We may note two points:(i) since  has a zero root, must be singular,(ii) it is not necessary to normalise the vectors; we can write B1 generally as ",17
1467,Example 1,17
1468,We use the pencil defined in (2.9.1.8) and we assume first that we have found an eigenvalue 1 = -1 and the associated eigenvector .,17
1469,Since the pencil is symmetric we shall have y = x.,17
1470,"Now, using (2.9.1.8), we have  Hence, from (5) we find  which, with B defined as Diag(1,2,2,1) gives  This matrix is simply singular; indeed, as is indicated by (3), it is annihilated by postmultiplication by : in (3),  is orthogonal to , i = 2,3,…, n.",17
1471,"Accordingly, the pencil P1( ); has a zero eigenvalue.",17
1472,The deflation can be repeated.,17
1473,"If, using P1( ),; we now find an eigenvalue 2 = 0.6 and the associated eigenvector , then   and then we may calculate  which, with B1 given by (6), yields  By inspection, B2 is doubly degenerate; it is annihilated by postmultiplication by  or .",17
1474,"A third deflation would produce B3, a unit rank matrix, which in this instance (n = 4) would be the last term in (3).",17
1475,2.9.3 Iteration with submatrices of vectors,17
1476,"We conclude this section with a description of a method often used in the following circumstances:(a) The problem is formulated as a matrix pencil; if it is of dynamical origin, we re given a non-singular symmetric stiffness matrix C of order n and a corresponding symmetric mass matrix B: the problem is to find certain modes and frequencies satisfying , x being proportional to exp (b) the order n is large, say  (c) Interest attaches only to a relatively small number, say , of consecutive frequencies and modes, beginning with the fundamental.",17
1477,"The process is one of iteration with a submatrix of p vectors, where p is greater than the number of eigenvalues sought, and involves the solution at each step of an eigenproblem of order p only.",17
1478,"Since B, C derive from a mechanical system and are non-singular, they will be pos. def., and accordingly (see Theorem VIII of 1.22) the system eigenvalues are all real, finite and positive.",17
1479,"if we write  then the full problem may be written  where X is the modal matrix,  the spectral matrix, and A = C-1B the dynamical matrix.",17
1480,"It is assumed that the eigenvalues in  (and the corresponding eigenvectors in X) are so ordered that  has the eigenvalues   in descending order of magnitude down the diagonal, 1 and the first vector in X define the fundamental frequency and mode.",17
1481,We are not concerned to solve (1) as a whole.,17
1482,"If it is partitioned in the form  where Y is of order (n × p) and  square, of order p,(2) gives  and only the first of these equations concerns us.",17
1483,"However, we may note that (see 1.19) premultiplication by  of the first equation in (1), and transposition, shows that  are both diagonal.",17
1484,"For analytical purposes we may normalise X  which imply, ,  Having set out some preliminary considerations, we now state the method.",17
1485,"Select a set of starting vectors Yo, arbitrary they must be linearly independent; then evaluate the (n × p) matrix  and use Wo to form the two square matrices of order p  Now solve the eigenproblem (any suitable method from this chapter may be used)  for its modal matrix Mo; the spectral matrix Ao which emerges is (see below) a first approximation to Ay.",17
1486,"Then an improved approximation to Y is  where do is an arbitrary non-singular diagonal matrix which may, , be used to make a homologous element in each of the corresponding columns of Y1 and Yo the same; do is useful, but not essential.",17
1487,This completes one step.,17
1488,"The next step uses Y1 in (6) to give W1 = AY1, and the cycle of operations is repeated until convergence occurs.",17
1489,We may note some interesting aspects of the method.,17
1490,"(i) If Yo consists of one vector only, so does Wo, and then  are scalars, s is the modal matrix .",17
1491,If we choose  in (9) then  and this is the single vector iteration discussed in 2.7.1.,17
1492,"Moreover, the trivial  eigenproblem gives a first approximation to 1 as the Rayleigh quotient. (ii) If Yo happens to be the correct set Y, the method makes this apparent , for then (3)  , on use of (5)  Thus both matrices are diagonal, the eigenproblem is again trivial, having the solution .",17
1493,"Then  when scaled appropriately, repeats  showing that both equal Y. (iii) If Yo happens to be a set of linear combinations of the vectors in Y, the correct solution is obtained in one step.",17
1494,"For we may then write  where P is a square matrix of order p, non-singular since the columns of Yo and of Y, separately, are linearly independent.",17
1495,Then  (3).,17
1496,"Thus, on use of (5),  On premultiplication by , the eigenproblem (8) reduces to  which has the solution  If do is chosen as  The condition envisaged in (iii) is, , unlikely, unless a neighbour system (see Chapter 3) supplies a good approximation to Y. In most cases, we must write  where R, like Yo, is of order (n × p).",17
1497,In this general case  (1).,17
1498,Then the eigenproblem matrices become  where (4) has been used.,17
1499,"We therefore have to solve for   Knowing Mo, we now use (11) to evaluate   whence in turn we find  Since  is non-singular, we may reduce the eigenproblem based on W1 to  which we solve for the unknown .",17
1500,"A third step leads to  It is clear from (13),(16) and (17) that after r steps we have to solve  If  is written as M,(18) in partitioned form is (see (10))  or, on expansion,  Now, since all the eigenvalues in  are greater than any of those in , when r is sufficiently large the terms in  become negligible compared with those in , when (19) reduces to  and if s is on-singular, this in turn reduces to  which has the solution .",17
1501,This shows that convergence is complete.,17
1502,Two things must be noted here.,17
1503,"First, although when r is large, in an overall sense the terms in  those in , yet the smallest element in  is not necessarily much larger than the largest element in .",17
1504,As a result calculation of the last two or three eigenvalues in  may not be very accurate.,17
1505,It is for this reason that we choose p to be greater than the number of eigenvalues sought.,17
1506,"Second, reduction of the eigenproblem to (20) requires s to be non-singular.",17
1507,"Now R has p linearly independent columns, and therefore also p linearly independent rows.",17
1508,"Thus s can be non-singular; but it is not necessarily so, and then Y as given by the method may be deficient.",17
1509,", if the top row of s were null, the first vector in X (the fundamental mode) would be absent in the make-up of Yo, and this absence would persist.",17
1510,There is no certain way of avoiding this difficulty when Yo is chosen arbitrarily; but in practice it does not often arise.,17
1511,"Although the eigenproblem to be solved at each step is vastly less time-consuming and expensive than direct methods applied to the full system, yet it does take much time.",17
1512,"However, after a few steps v, and  usually become heavily diagonal, Mr tends towards I; this occurs before the vectors Yr have converged.",17
1513,"In these circumstances, use of the Collar-Jahn method, described in Chapter 3; may greatly expedite the solution.",17
1514,An example of this is given in 3.9.,17
1515,Further reference to the method is also made in 8.5.,17
1516,Example 1,17
1517,"The small-order example which is all we can give here does not do justice to the method, but shows how it works.",17
1518,We begin with an illustration of the situation in (iii) above; the reader is invited to check the arithmetic.,17
1519,"Let  Then  Suppose now we are given, or choose,  It then follows that  The eigenvalues of  are thus 10 and 5 and   The reader should check that these are eigenvectors of A and that they correspond to eigenvalues 10 and 5.",17
1520,"We have thus obtained our solution, in this case, in one step.",17
1521,"It will be found that each column of  is in fact, a linear combination of the columns of ",17
1522,Example 2,17
1523,"We use the same A, B, C, as in Example 1, but select as our starting vector submatrix  In choosing Yo we have selected simple vectors which are clearly linearly independent, and which between them bring all elements in A into operation in the formation of Wo.",17
1524,We then find  where the product is quoted to four significant figures.,17
1525,"Its eigenvalues are 9.805, 2.411 and, very approximately (great accuracy is not necessary),  which yields, again approximately,  Proceeding in this way, we find at the end of the fifth step  and in the sixth step this gives   These are so nearly diagonal that the eigenproblem is trivial; the eigenvalues are 10, 4.9987.",17
1526,"However, we do not obtain convergence until after the 10th step, which gives eigenvalues 10, 5 and  The second columns should be{ 1,1,0, -1}.",17
1527,2.9.4 A variant,17
1528,"We now give a variant of the method of 2.9.3; we do so partly because the variant can save computer time, especially if may iterations are required, but also because it enables us simply to bring out certain features of the method, which lead to possible modifications.",17
1529,"For simplicity, we assume that the eigenvalues sought are all different.",17
1530,"We are given the matrices C and B, both symmetric an pos. def.",17
1531,"We may therefore use Choleski's method (see 2.4.2) to find a lower triangular matrix L , and may then evaluate , accordingly the equation  may be written  and S is symmetric and pos. def.",17
1532,"Now, using the three matrices C, B and A = C-1B as in 2.9.3 we work only with S.",17
1533,Suppose we now proceed as in 2.9.3: we begin with the submatrix Yo and successively evaluate  and we then solve for Mo the eigenproblem  Then a new approximation to Y is   At this point we may ask: what is the purpose of eigenproblem?,17
1534,"The answer appears if we premultiply and postmultiply Equation (5) by appropriate quantities to give since do permutes with ,  on use of (6).",17
1535,"Transposition of (7) shows (compare 1.19) that  permutes with  and is therefore diagonal, as is .",17
1536,"The columns of  are thus mutually orthogonal; this is the purpose of evaluating Mo: its use orthogonalises the columns, an our ultimate objective is the orthogonal set Y.",17
1537,"A second step with Yo in (2) replaced by Y1, leads to the eigenproblem (compare (5))  Again we may pause and observe that (8) gives us  directly; we do not need to find Mo first from (5) and then M1 from (8).",17
1538,Thus the step (5) is unnecessary.,17
1539,"Then, in its turn, the step (8) is unnecessary; .",17
1540,"Indeed, in theory all that is required is that a sufficient number of direct iterations is made, with the columns orthogonalised as the last step; in practice, however, the numbers would become increasingly ill-conditioned as S is raised to a high power and approximates to a unit rank matrix.",17
1541,"However, it is probably sufficient if the columns are orthogonalised at, say, every fourth iteration.",17
1542,"If we do this, the procedure is as follows.",17
1543,Begin with Yo and evaluate successively .,17
1544,"At this stage, evaluate  and solve the eigenproblem  for M. Then a new approximation, which has mutually orthogonal columns, is , with which Yo the cycle is repeated, .",17
1545,Example 1,17
1546,"We use the same matrices B and C as in Example 2.9.3.1. then, if , , we find, to four decimal places,    As our starting matrix we choose  This has mutually orthogonal columns; however, as we shall see later, it is not a good initial choice for the first column.",17
1547,"We ow form , at each stage making the ""11"" and ""22"" elements unity.",17
1548,We find  we require  as it stands.,17
1549,"We now form v,  as in (9),(10), and solve (11) for M. To sufficient accuracy, we find  and then a new Yo is, with d chosen appropriately,  and it may be checked that these two columns are, sufficiently nearly, orthogonal.",17
1550,We now repeat the cycle.,17
1551,"This time we find   and  and again, sufficiently nearly, the columns are orthogonal.",17
1552,"A third cycle leads to the eigenvectors (and eigenvalues) of S:  We leave it to the reader to establish that the eigenvectors of the original system, given by premultiplication of w by  may be written ",17
1553,2.10 IMPROVEMENT OF THE ACCURACY OF EIGENVALUES AND VECTORS,17
1554,"It frequently happens, both in dynamical problems and in other eigenvalue problems that we have approximate values for one or more eigenvalues (and perhaps vectors) and require to obtain more exact values.",17
1555,"This problem, from another viewpoint, is discussed more fully in Chapter 3.",17
1556,Here we shall deal only with some simple cases.,17
1557,2.10.1 Problem formulated as a matrix pencil,17
1558,"For simplicity, let us first discuss the undamped oscillations of a mechanical system having n degrees of freedom, the equations of motion of which have been derived by Lagrangian methods from energy considerations; they will appear, in the usual notation of dynamics, as  Here x is the column of coordinates; in what follows, we assume the last element x to be non-nodal (if it is not, it can be made so by rewriting the equations in a different order).",17
1559,"Also C, the inertia matrix, will be symmetric and pos. def. and B, the stiffness matrix, also symmetric and non-neg. def; finally, F is a column of applied forcing functions.",17
1560,"In simple harmonic motion, these forces, and x, will be proportional to exp  and if we then write  for{ go}2,(1) reduces to the usual formula  .",17
1561,"We observe that, the given matrices C and B,(2) contains 2n + 1 other quantities, viz. λ, x, and F. Since we have n equations, we can determine any n of these quantities the remaining n + 1, to which we can ascribe arbitrary values.",17
1562,"Here, we shall",17
1563,(a) choose λ as an independent variable;,17
1564,(b) prescribe the value unity for ;,17
1565,"(c) prescribe the value zero for each of the first n -1 functions in F, the last being written f.",17
1566,"Then f and the coordinates  become functions of λ, and we note that when f vanishes (i.e. all the functions F vanish in (2)), λ will be an eigenvalue and  the corresponding eigenvector.",17
1567,"We not write, in partitioned form, , , and, since the pencil in (2) is symmetric, , where  is a square submatrix of K of order n = 1.",17
1568,"Then (2) becomes , which yields, progressively, , .",17
1569,"Since the submatrices in (5) are all functions of λ,(7) and (8) give f and ξ (or x) as functions of λ.",17
1570,Now suppose we have an approximation  to an eigenvalue.,17
1571,"Since f is a function of λ which vanishes at the eigenvalues, we may use it in the Newton-Raphson method to obtain an improved approximation : , the zero suffixes indicating that the functions are calculated for .",17
1572,"Equation (8) is not suitable for differentiation; instead, we obtain another form for f by premultiplying (6) by ; we obtain , and since K is symmetric it follows that , which, with K given by (5), reduces to .",17
1573,"In a numerical calculation, we use (11) for  and either (8) or (10) for f.",17
1574,"If we use the latter, we must note that, at , , when Equation (9) reduces to , i.e. the well-known Rayleigh quotient.",17
1575,"In the numerical evaluation of this, we obtain x from (7) with .",17
1576,"Having obtained  we can adopt it as a new  and repeat the cycle of approximation, which is known to be quadratically convergent: i.e. if  is the true eigenvalue, then for small differences .",17
1577,"Equation (9), with  given by (8), is analytically precisely equivalent to (12).",17
1578,"In numerical applications, they may differ, the accuracy with which  and ξ are evaluated.",17
1579,Probably (12) is the user to use.,17
1580,Example 1,17
1581,"In Equation (1), let .",17
1582,Suppose we are given an approximate eigenvalue .,17
1583,"We evaluate  , which we have partitioned as in (5).",17
1584,"Then ξ is given by (7) as , and the reader may check that this yields .",17
1585,"We give this to four decimal places only: it is not necessary to calculate ξ to great accuracy, but once found, it must be used consistently, and calculations made accurately.",17
1586,"We deduce that for , the approximate eigenvector is , and we are able to calculate , , whence .",17
1587,"If we round this off to a new , we quickly find that  also, i.e. 40 is an exact eigenvalue; also the corresponding eigenvector becomes  ",17
1588,"If, the Rayleigh quotient, we use (9) directly, we require from (8) .",17
1589,"Hence (see also (16)) , in close agreement with (16).",17
1590,Problem formulated a single matrix,17
1591,"If we premultiply (2.10.1.2) by  and write , we obtain the problem the characteristic matrix of A: .",17
1592,"Note that here A is, , not symmetric; however, it evidently possesses the same eigenvalues as the system (2.10.1.2).",17
1593,"Let us now abandon the connection with a mechanical system, and treat this as a problem involving any given real matrix A, the eigenvalues and vectors for which have to be found.",17
1594,The treatment is closely similar to that of §2.10.1.,17
1595,"As before, we choose λ as an independent variable, assign the value unity to  and zeros to the first n -1 elements of G: ; we also write, remembering that A is not symmetric, .",17
1596,"Then Equation (2) gives us , from which we obtain as before , .",17
1597,We now look for the left vector  corresponding to x as the right vector; in §2.10.1 this was : here it is different.,17
1598,"(2) we write ; by the same argument as before, we set , , hence from (4),(9) and (10) , yielding , , and on comparison of (12) with (7) we see that h and g are identical; this is not surprising, since they are evidently similar functions and have the same zeros, i.e. the eigenvalues.",17
1599,"As before, we now employ g in a Newton-Raphson application to improve the accuracy of any given approximate eigenvalue .",17
1600,"Premultiplication of (5) by  gives , and then, differentiating term by term, we have , which (4) reduces to .",17
1601,"Accordingly, as before .",17
1602,"This is the parallel to (2.10.1.12); as before, we can, if we wish, use g as given by (7) for alternative treatment, but we shall not pursue this here.",17
1603,Example 1,17
1604,"In (2), let .",17
1605,"This matrix is, in fact, obtained from our previous example by evaluating .",17
1606,"However, we shall treat a different eigenvalue: suppose we are told that there is an eigenvalue in the neighbourhood of .",17
1607,We evaluate and partition .,17
1608,"Then we find from (6) and (11) that , , and hence, from (15), .",17
1609,"If we round this off to a new , and repeat the calculation — we leave it to the reader to check this — we find ; finally, rounding this off to 20 and repeating again, we find that 20 is an exact eigenvalue and that the corresponding right and left eigenvectors are, respectively, , .",17
1610,2.10.3 Factorisation of A into two symmetric matrices,17
1611,"In Equation (2.10.2.1) we derived A as the product of two given symmetric matrices,  and B; this was done for convenience in the examples.",17
1612,"For completeness, we interpolate here a brief discussion of the reverse procedure: it was shown in §1.19 and Theorem V of §1.22 that a matrix can always be factorised into two symmetric matrices, but the subject was not pursued there.",17
1613,Here we obtain the most general solution.,17
1614,"We first continue the discussion of §1.19, and treat the most common case in which A has distinct eigenvalues.",17
1615,"It was shown there that A permutes with , which is therefore diagonal.",17
1616,"This diagonal matrix, D, is arbitrary, since X is arbitrary to a postmultiplying diagonal matrix.",17
1617,"Write where P, Q, R,…are arbitrary.",17
1618,"Now if (see §1.18) we write , C may now be expressed as , C is expressible as an arbitrary linear sum of the n symmetric unit rank matrices .",17
1619,"Next consider the case where A has two equal eigenvalues α, but is not defective.",17
1620,Then A can be written with the (2 × 2) scalar submatrix αI in the leading diagonal position.,17
1621,This means that D is not necessarily diagonal; corresponding to αI there may be a (2 × 2) block which is arbitrary it must be symmetric and non-singular.,17
1622,"This therefore contains three arbitrary quantities, giving n + 1 in all.",17
1623,"Finally, suppose A has two equal eigenvalues α but is defective.",17
1624,"As previously, we note that   since  is symmetric.",17
1625,Accordingly  with K as defined in Theorem V of §1.22.,17
1626,Thus  permutes with .,17
1627,This implies that  is diagonal the leading (2 × 2) submatrix.,17
1628,"Now the following submatrices permute (see also §1.21) , , where a, b are arbitrary.",17
1629,"The second of these is thus the leading submatrix of , whence in  it is , which is symmetric and contains just two arbitrary quantities; there are thus just n arbitrary quantities in all.",17
1630,Extension to more complicated cases is not difficult.,17
1631,"However, these studies employ the modal and spectral matrices, and in practice these may not be known.",17
1632,"We can, however, find directly the general solution of .",17
1633,"Write , C contains n (n + 1) /2 unknown elements, n in the diagonal, viz. p, q, r,…, and n (n -1) /2 elsewhere, viz. a, b, c….",17
1634,"Now the conditions that B is symmetric provide just n (n -1) /2 linear algebraic equations connecting the unknowns, we can determine a, b, c,…p, q, r…which are arbitrary.",17
1635,The procedure is best illustrated a numerical example: we choose A to be the matrix of (2.10.2.16).,17
1636,Then .,17
1637,"Then the condition that , , leads to , and there are five other such equations.",17
1638,"We set them out thus:  These are then solved, e.g. by direct operation on rows, when a, b, c,…emerge as quantities linear in p, q, r, s.",17
1639,"To set out the result compactly, we write , where …have zero diagonals a unit in the first, second,…place respectively.",17
1640,"In this example, we can write , where to keep the elements numerically simple, we have extracted the factor 1/3 from  and .",17
1641,This is evidently the most general form of C. Postmultiplication by A yields B in the form  .,17
1642,"When p, q, r, s are assigned numerically, C and B are known and then the factors  and B of A are found.",17
1643,"We can recover the matrix C (and also B) defined in (2.10.1.13) by assigning to p, q, r, s the values 1, 1.52, 3, 0.92 appearing in the diagonal of C.",17
1644,"The following characteristics of , , etc. are to be noted.",17
1645,"First, since each contains zeros in its diagonal, it cannot be pos. def.",17
1646,"Next, the ranks of the matrices do not conform to any simple pattern:  is of rank 4,  and  of rank 3 and  of rank 2.",17
1647,"Finally, our main problem, since for the Rayleigh quotient (which gives eigenvalues identical to those of A) , and since also p, q, r, s are arbitrary, it follows that , i = 1,2,3,4, though this result is not particularly helpful in practice.",17

1649,"We discuss here the same problem as that in §2.10.2, but vary the treatment.",17
1650,"The eigenvalues are determined by Equation (2.10.2.5) with g = 0, viz. , where α is the submatrix of A corresponding to , and  is the last diagonal element in A. From this we find , , and elimination of ξ leads to the equation for λ  .",17
1651,"This equation is not easy to solve numerically as it stands; however, if we are given an approximation  to an eigenvalue, we write  for the exact eigenvalue, which therefore satisfies (4), we obtain , which is now an equation for ε Write  then .",17
1652,"Thus , provided ε is sufficiently small.",17
1653,"Insertion in (5) leads to , or, if , , , etc., .",17
1654,"Finally, if  is written , we obtain the scalar equation .",17
1655,"Provided the series converges, this may be solved for ε in any suitable way; often a regression procedure, beginning with ε = 0 on the right-hand side to give a new approximation on the left, will solve the equation in two or three steps.",17
1656,"Comparison of (8) with (3) shows that, when ε has been found from (9) , both eigenvalue and vector are found.",17
1657,Example 1,17
1658,", we use the matrix specified in Equation (2.10.2.16) and we are it has an eigenvalue near .",17
1659,"Then, in (6), with n=4, .",17
1660,"Also, ; ; ;.",17
1661,"Hence, using (7), we obtain , , , , , and it is in fact unnecessary to proceed further.",17
1662,"We now evaluate the scalars ; they become , , , , .",17
1663,"Hence Equation (9), for ε, becomes , and if we collect the linear terms and rationalise:  and solution of this, by regression or otherwise, gives ; .",17

4,The British Library 1992,18
5,"Scholars in the humanities, like researchers in other subjects, make use of computers for word-processing, for cataloguing the books in their departmental libraries, and also for desk-top publishing.",18
6,This generic computer use is not my topic.,18
7,"I want to talk about the use of computers in actual research, and the features of that use which derive from the special characteristics of the humanities.",18
8,University lecturers in the humanities are making increasing use of computers for teaching purposes; but this too lies outside my scope.,18
9,"The uses of the computer in humanities research can be divided into three main kinds, the nature of the objects studied.",18
10,"A humanities researcher may use a computer to study strings (as in natural language processing or the analysis of literary texts) or to study numbers (of discrete items or events, as in social and economic history) or to study icons, whether visual (as in art history), or acoustic (as in musicology).",18
11,individual humanities disciplines make use of one of these types of computer study: the student of literary style will make statistical studies of the frequency of the lexical strings and grammatical features identified in his chosen text; the historian may have occasion to search through and analyse the texts of his primary sources in machine-readable form.,18
12,"In art history a large part of electronic data processing takes the form of cataloguing works of art, and only a small proportion of research concerns pattern recognition or digitization of images; in musicology it has only recently become possible to study scores directly input to the computer without the mediation of alphanumeric code.",18
13,In all humanities disciplines the computer is used in an endeavour to replace intuition with quantification.,18
14,"Linguists, students of literature, art historians and musicologists all seek to identify styles, and the similarity and differences between them.",18
15,Common to all these disciplines is the question: what statistics define a style?,18
16,How far can a style be identified with an aggregate of statistical features?,18
17," , a historian will make use of statistical techniques to give objective substance to intuitively sensed historical processes or trends.",18
18,"In all humanities disciplines the use of computers seems to have passed through three stages, each corresponding roughly to a decade.",18
19,"The first stage was the period of pioneering work: the abortive first attempts at machine translation; the earliest computer concordances; the early authorship studies of Morton, Ellegard, Mosteller and Wallace; the first conferences on computing in the humanities (1964–7) and the more specialised ones in history and anthropology (from 1962) and in literature and linguistics (from 1970).",18
20,"During this period concordances to many major works of literature were produced by computer, but published in traditional hard copy.",18
21,"Many of these early projects were the work of interdisciplinary research teams, including not only humanities scholars but senior information scientists, responsible for custom-designed software.",18
22,This period lasted until about the end of the sixties.,18
23,The second period lasted through the seventies until the early eighties.,18
24,"Humanities scholars learned how to write their own programs, as programming languages became easier to master.",18
25,"But more significantly the development and widespread availability of pre-designed packages, OCP (the Oxford Concordance Package) for concordance construction, and SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) for statistical analysis, meant that it was possible for the humanist to become more independent of the computing experts, and to operate with low-level assistance.",18
26,"In history, , the use of computers to provide material for use in monographs, once a matter to be trumpeted in the text, became a commonplace to be noted without elaboration in footnotes.",18
27,"Humanities computing centres were set up in Oxford, Liege, Tubingen and other places.",18
28,"While the availability of systems SPSS meant that there was a temptation for humanists to fit their special data to the software, to design software for the data, on the other hand there began to be developed systems for source-oriented data entry, of which the most famous was CLIO.",18
29,"Throughout the seventies and the early eighties, humanities scholars, despite their growing independence, still worked in collaboration with, and usually in proximity to, their colleagues in computing centres.",18
30,"With the advent of cheap microcomputers in the mid-eighties, the typical humanities scholar was more likely to be found doing research at home on a personal computer, attached to a network, but engaged much less interactively with  in the computing centre.",18
31,"As a result of the microcomputer revolution, electronic data processing has become a familiar feature of research in most humanities disciplines.",18
32,"Nowadays, I am told, in Germany most doctoral students in history make use of computers, not just for word processing, at some stage of their studies.",18
33,"this will shortly be the case, where it is not so already, in other European countries.",18
34,"The building of large databases, whether unstructured (like text-archives) or structured (like many historical databases) has been a major preoccupation of this period.",18
35,The development of CD-ROM techniques has been of particular  for students of texts: classics students can search the complete database of ancient literature by using the IBYCUS implementation of the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae; students of English can use the CD-ROM version of the Oxford English Dictionary to conduct searches which would take lifetimes if conducted on the twenty volumes of hard copy.,18
36,"In archaeology, I understand, it can now be said that computers are automatically considered for any project, however small.",18
37,"Throughout these stages of development, the research conducted by humanities scholars has taken place at three levels.",18
38,"The lowest, most general, and most unambiguously useful level consists in the employment of a computer to perform a humdrum task in less time than would be possible for an unaided human: the search through a text for a quotation, the determination of a word frequency, the construction and analysis of a contingency table, the classification of iconic data.",18
39,This kind of activity will leave little visible trace in the published work of the researcher.,18
40,At the other end of the scale there are ambitious research projects undertaken for methodical demonstration purposes.,18
41,The results are sought not so much to enrich the domain of research with fundamentally new findings demonstrate the validity of some new form of automatic processing.,18
42,Two examples of such projects are discussed in a recent paper by Manfred Thaller.,18
43,In France Gian Piero Zarri has developed a system known as RESEDA to allow Artificial Intelligence techniques to be applied to historical source material (concerning the Hundred Years War).,18
44,The project is well known in AI circles; but it seems to have left virtually no trace in the historical literature.,18
45,This is because the system is so complicated that no historian could use it without explicit support from the AI project group.,18
46,"Again, in 1981–7 the Volkswagenstiftung funded on a large scale the ARCOS project, a system which photographs a three-dimensional archaeological object, provides a drawing and converts it into data which lend themselves easily to methods like Cluster Analysis.",18
47,The prototype was in the vanguard of technical development.,18
48,Unfortunately the price of the prototype was so high that it was the financial reach of the archaeological community.,18
49,"Projects of this kind win reclaim in the literature of AI, but pass almost without remark in the parent humanities disciplines history and archaeology.",18
50,"Where, in fact, are we to look for the major effects of the use of computers in humanities research?",18
51,"The most spectacular is the creation of the whole new topic of research, the new discipline of computational linguistics.",18
52,"The most widely felt effect has been the perfecting of traditional tools of research, data-collections, concordances, dictionaries, and corpora.",18
53,"New tools of research, and new testbeds for theories become possible.",18
54,Perhaps the most dramatic opportunity being developed for linguistic studies is the British National Corpus.,18
55,"This is a collaborative venture, involving three publishers (OUP, Longman, Chambers), the British Library, and two universities (Oxford and Lancaster).",18
56,The aim is to provide a corpus of 100 million words of contemporary spoken and written English to provide raw data for the empirical study of language by a wide variety of disciplines.,18
57,The project started in January 1991 with a grant from the DTI and the SERC.,18
58,"When complete it should provide an unparalleled resource for lexicographers, and information technologists, and a test-bed for theoretical linguists.",18
59,"But the multiplication of new basic research tools in the humanities, it is surprisingly difficult to point, in specific areas, to solid, uncontroverted gains to scholarship which could not have been achieved without the new technology.",18
60,"The high hopes which some computer enthusiasts held out that the computer would revolutionise humanistic study have been proved, over and over again, to be unrealistic.",18
61,Sometimes the initial claims made were much exaggerated: as the claim made in New Testament studies that the computer would for the first time reveal the true lineaments of the Bible that we had ignorantly worshipped.,18
62,"But even in areas where there was no hubris in the initial claims, the results delivered have often been disappointing.",18
63,"Between humdrum research and showpiece research, what the humanities scholarly community is really anxious to see is work which is both (a) respected as an original scholarly contribution within its own discipline and (b) could clearly not have been done without a computer.",18
64,In the last three decades the number of such contributions is sadly small.,18
65,No doubt in each discipline my colleagues could single out a handful of seminal projects.,18
66,"What I want to do, in this second part of my lecture, is to illustrate in the field in which I have been myself involved — literature and stylistics — the kind of projects which have been attempted and the limited success which has been achieved.",18
67,"From the outset, some scholars have been highly suspicious of the use of numerical methods in literary studies.",18
68,"This suspicion is particularly strong among biblical scholars, and one of them, Principal T.M. Knox, said twenty years ago ‘The spirit moveth where it listeth and is not to be reduced to the numerical terms with which alone a computer can cope’.",18
69,"But such hostility to numerical methods seems irrational, and often inconsistent.",18
70,"Biblical scholars have long noticed, and based arguments on, the occurrence of hapax legomena, or words which occur once only in a given text or author.",18
71,"But if one is to allow counting in a literary context, it seems perverse to insist that counting should stop at the number one and go no further.",18
72,"Since long before the invention of computers, students of literary texts have made extensive use of concordances.",18
73,"Concordances are often more helpful than dictionaries for determining the precise sense of a word in an author's vocabulary, and they enable favourite phrases and tricks of style to be identified and catalogued.",18
74,To make a concordance of a  text by hand calls for months or years of tedious labour.,18
75,"With the aid of a computer, concordances of many kinds can be made with comparatively little difficulty.",18
76,"Students of literature who used concordance packages on mainframes commonly asked the computer to produce for them a complete print-out of their chosen concordance, and then took it home to consult in the traditional manner, turning the pages of a sheaf of paper.",18
77,Producing several hundred pages of hard copy with a desk-top computer and printer would be a long and tedious business.,18
78,It is much more common now to use the facilities provided by a package micro-OCP to generate a particular concordance entry on the screen of a PC directly from the text-base whenever it is needed.,18
79,"Thus, if you want to study the use of the word ‘true’ in Arthur Hugh Clough, generate a massive concordance containing all the words in Clough's poems, and then leafing through it to find the word ‘true’, you use the concordance package commands to generate a concordance which contains all and only the uses of ‘true’.",18
80,You then consult that on the screen and print it out only if you think you are going to want to look up the same word again.,18
81,Concordances produced by computer may differ from traditional hand-made concordances in several ways.,18
82,"One is that they will be much more complete: they will contain all the tiny function words which were too frequent, and regarded as too unimportant, to figure in a work like Cruden's Concordance to the Scriptures.",18
83,"More interestingly, the items which provide the focus to the concordance need not be dictionary headings or even vocabulary words .",18
84,"A particular grammatical feature, a particular lexical item, may provide the focus of the concordance; thus, you may look up, in a Virgil concordance, not the occurrences of ‘bellum’, but the  of the second declension neuter singular nominative noun.",18
85,"Concordances of this kind to the New Testament have been produced on the basis of the Analytical New Testament compiled by Barbara and Timothy Friberg (Baker Books, 1981).",18
86,What is the literary scholar to do with all the information to be found in the  and word-lists generated by the new technology?,18
87,"Much of the material will be exploited in all kinds of traditional ways, for the study of meaning, style, and language history.",18
88,But the computer also facilitates one particular type of study of texts: the study of their quantifiable features by statistical methods.,18
89,"The statistical study of style is a discipline which is still in its infancy, but has recently been showing signs of vigorous growth.",18
90,It is often called ‘stylometry’.,18
91,Stylometric studies may be undertaken for many different reasons.,18
92,"One may wish to study the statistics of word usage or word order understanding a text better, to catch nuances of meaning and perhaps to render them into a different language.",18
93,"Or one may be interested in the history of the development of a language, and study the speech habits of particular authors as an indication of linguistic change.",18
94,Or one may hope to use the quantifiable features of a text as an indication of the authorship of a text when this is in question.,18
95,Authorship attribution studies of this kind have caught the public eye rather more than other types of stylometric inquiry.,18
96,"It is sometimes claimed that stylometry enables the scholar to identify the fingerprint of an author, a stylistic criterion, or set of criteria, which can be used to determine with certainty questions of disputed authorship.",18
97,"Such claims seem exaggerated, on the basis of the evidence presented hitherto; but there is no doubt that stylometry can offer valuable evidence of a novel kind which, taken more traditional evidence, can often throw new light on ancient problems.",18
98,"The study of hapax legomena formed the basis of one of the earliest sophisticated statistical studies of the Bible, that of K. Grayston and G. Herdan in 1960, who, building on work of P.N. Harrison in the nineteen twenties, argued that the Pastoral Epistles could not be the authentic work of the Apostle Paul.",18
99,Probably the best known stylometric work on the New Testament is that of A.Q. Morton.,18
100,"Morton, in collaboration with others, has argued, from 1966 to the present time, that in the Pauline corpus only Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and Galatians form a homogeneous group which can be attributed to a single hand.",18
101,"Morton's arguments were based on a study of sentence lengths, on the frequencies of common words, and on other grammatical features the proportion of different parts of speech.",18
102,"My own investigations into the NT, based on the full data provided by the Friberg Analytical NT, came to much less dramatic conclusions than Morton.",18
103,I addressed first two ancient problems: the relationship between Luke and Acts (I found that Acts resembled Luke more than it resembled any other book of the NT) and the relationship between the Apocalypse and the Gospel of St John (I found that they differed from more than any other two books of the NT).,18
104,"On the more difficult topic of the Pauline corpus I concluded that the evidence was equally compatible with a widely differing set of authors or a single unusually versatile author, but that it did not support the view that four epistles stood out as uniform by comparison with all others.",18
105,The use of stylometry in authorship attribution studies depends on the hypothesis that there are quantifiable features of style which are characteristic of particular authors.,18
106,"Ideally, a stylometric test of authorship should be a feature which is characteristic of all the known works of a particular author and which is unique to his works.",18
107,"Features which are to be found in all, and only, the works of a particular author turn out to be frustratingly difficult to come by.",18
108,"Authorship attribution problems are easier to deal with when they can be cast into the following form: the measured features, does the doubtful work resemble the work of candidate author A more than it resembles the work of candidate author B?",18
109,A classic example of this kind of study was the work of the Harvard statisticians Frederick Mosteller and David Wallace on the Federalist Papers.,18
110,"These papers were a series of articles published in 1787 and 1788 to persuade the citizens of New York to ratify the U.S. Constitution; most of the papers were known to have been written by Hamilton or by Madison, but the authorship of twelve of them was disputed.",18
111,"By comparing the rate of occurrence of particular words in the disputed papers with the rates in known Hamilton papers, and rates in known Madison papers, the authors were able to establish beyond reasonable doubt that Madison wrote the disputed papers.",18
112,"A partly similar problem is presented by the Aristotelian corpus, which contains two ethical treatises of parallel structure, the Nicomachean Ethics and the Eudemian Ethics.",18
113,"The problem here is not one of authorship attribution, since most scholars regard them both as genuinely Aristotelian; the puzzle is that three books make a double appearance in the manuscript tradition, once as books five, six and seven of the Nicomachean Ethics, once as books four, five and six of the Eudemian Ethics.",18
114,"In 1978 I published a study (The Aristotelian Ethics) in which I argued, on the basis of twenty-four independent tests based on 60% of the word usage in the text, that the disputed books resembled the Eudemian context the  one.",18
115,Similar problems have been studied by similar methods in the very different context of the law-courts.,18
116,It is sometimes a question whether a particular confession is the unaided work of an accused or is a fabrication of a police officer.,18
117,"A.Q. Morton, in his book Literary Detection records how stylometric evidence was admitted in such a case in 1974.",18
118,The Californian court trying Patricia Hearst for bank robbery was asked to hear stylometric evidence to help determine whether she composed the propaganda for the Symbionese Liberation Army which was part of the case against her.,18
119,The trial judge refused the evidence on the grounds of ‘the relative infancy of this area of scientific endeavour’.,18
120,But anyone working in this field will receive invitations to offer evidence as an expert witness in such cases.,18
121,"In recent years many authorship attribution problems, in a variety of languages, have been tackled, with varying degrees of success, by stylometric methods.",18
122,"Thus Thomas Merriam has used these methods to try to show that Sir Thomas More is the genuine work of Shakespeare, and it was partly on stylometric grounds that the poem ‘Shall I die?’ won its place in the Oxford Shakespeare.",18
123,Y. Radday has used Hebrew stylometry to address the problem of the unity of Isaiah and to argue against the standard critical theory which sees the book of Genesis as woven from three disparate strands of tradition.,18
124,"the proliferation of stylometric authorship studies, it would be wrong to think that attribution is the only goal for statistical studies of style.",18
125,One of the most interesting recent works is J.F. Burrows' Computation into Criticism.,18
126,"This is a study of Jane Austen's novels based on common prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns and the like.",18
127,"‘It is a truth not generally acknowledged’ Burrows points out ‘that in most discussions of works of English fiction, we proceed a third of our material were not really there.’",18
128,Burrows shows how Jane Austen makes skilful use of the common words to build up different idiolects for the different persons in the novels to bring out the differences in their characters.,18
129,"Admiral Croft, , uses ‘we’ and its cases ten times as frequently as Lady Catherine de Burgh.",18
130,"It is by tiny touches these — though only a stylometrist would consciously notice them — that Jane Austen builds up the picture of one character's clubbability, and the other's insolence of rank.",18
131,Computer-assisted studies of style have often attempted to settle questions of chronology in the work of authors whose works are undated.,18
132,Leonard Brandwood has worked for many decades on the chronology of Plato's dialogues.,18
133,"One of the most recent contributions to this debate has been that of Gerland Ledger, in his book Recounting Plato.",18
134,Ledger took the simplest possible feature of language — the occurrence of particular letters of the alphabet — and by subjecting this to a complicated multivariate analysis he came closer than many previous workers to identifying particular authors and even works.,18
135,"He drew new conclusions about the authenticity of the dubious dialogues, and the chronology of the entire corpus.",18
136,"In the study of literature, quantitative methods can never achieve the primacy which they enjoy in the experimental sciences and in many branches of social studies.",18
137,"But scholars who use them with a sober sense of their limitations can add a new dimension to literary studies, and in an age of divided cultures we should surely be ready to welcome a marriage of literacy and numeracy.",18
138,"However, of the studies I have mentioned it would be difficult to claim that more than a handful fulfilled the criteria I mentioned earlier: both (a) respected as an original scholarly contribution within its own discipline and (b) could clearly not have been done without a computer.",18
139,"Indeed throughout humanities disciplines, after thirty-odd years of this kind of research, there are embarrassingly few books and articles which can be confidently pointed out as passing both tests.",18
140,"This has meant that many enthusiasts for computing in the humanities have an uncomfortable sense of crisis, a feeling of promise unfulfilled.",18
141,Gone is the glad confident morning in which Ladurie could say ‘L'historien de demain sera programmeur ou il ne sera plus’.,18
142,The feeling of disillusion is indeed partly the result of the misplaced optimism and exaggerated claims of some of the pioneers: the belief was sometimes encouraged in the past that feeding data into a computer would automatically solve a scholar's problems.,18
143,"Rare has been the computer project which did not, in the course of execution, bring to light an initial overestimation of the technical possibilities, and an underestimation of the problems of data preparation.",18
144,"The proliferation of personal computers in the last decade has often, embarrassingly, gone with an actual diminution in methodological sophistication.",18
145,"If the fruits of computing in the humanities are less abundant than one might have hoped, there are also disadvantages of the introduction of computers which are becoming all too obvious.",18
146,"Let me mention six, which I will call: redundancy of people, redundancy of effort, diversion of effort, diversion of funding, distortion of research and transfer of population.",18
147,1),18
148,Redundancy of people.,18
149,Alexander Cruden spent the best years of his life preparing his concordance to the Bible.,18
150,There is any need for dedicated Crudens to make concordances.,18
151,"Classical scholars among us will all, as students, have stood in awe of our seniors who, given a rare Greek word, could pluck their memories the ten contexts in different classical authors in which it was used.",18
152,Nowadays any student can discover that information in moments with the aid of IBYCUS.,18
153,It is possible to found a reputation for scholarship on being good at spotting allusions.,18
154,This problem is the humanistic analogue of the problem of the stoker on the electric train.,18
155,"It is not a serious one for the discipline, nor even in human terms does it compare with the undesirable side-effects of technological innovations in practical life and scientific research.",18
156,2),18
157,Redundancy of effort.,18
158,Scholars who are good at knowing where to look for the sources of their subject matter may not be good at knowing where to look for suitable software.,18
159,The replacement of mainframe use by desktop computing in recent years means that scholars working alone do not have as much contact with computer-learned people as they used to do.,18
160,This means they are less software developments.,18
161,"Hence, if they get interested in designing their own software, scholars may spend their time reinventing last year's wheel.",18
162,3),18
163,Diversion of effort.,18
164,"the software designed is genuinely original and useful, there is a danger that scholars become hooked on the production of software.",18
165,There is a risk that a scholar whose talents and academic position call for historical and critical work will spend most of his or her working time as a programmer.,18
166,4),18
167,Diversion of funding.,18
168,"Because there is pressure on departments in humanistic subjects to appear and efficient, it is much easier to persuade funding bodies to give money for computers and software than to buy manuscripts, rare books, or second and third copies of frequently used library texts.",18
169,After a few years a department may be left with serious gaps in its library and a load of superannuated computing equipment.,18
170,5),18
171,Distortion of research.,18
172,"There is a danger that projects may be undertaken not because they are likely to lead to academically interesting results, but simply because they are susceptible to computerisation.",18
173,"Scholars feel the need to show they have used the latest technology, electronic methods are not the appropriate one.",18
174,"But in the words of Manfred Thaller it is important for humanists to adapt the software to the scholarship, not the scholarship to the software.",18
175,6),18
176,Transfer of populations.,18
177,"Professor Connor, in a fascinating paper on computers in classical studies, claims that computers came just at the wrong time, at a time when scholar's interests were moving from textual studies to critical theory, women's studies and the like.",18
178,He says: ‘Computer technology became available precisely at the wrong moment in the profession's development.,18
179,The era of traditional lexical and textual studies had largely passed…,18
180,"The energy of North American classicists, , has concentrated on interpretive questions and on the writing of essays and monographs of social themes, cultural history and literary criticism…",18
181,"The questions posed by Feminist, Marxist, Structuralist and Post-Structuralist criticism have not lent themselves to computer-based responses.’",18
182,Is this just a malign coincidence?,18
183,One may well speculate on possible causes for the phenomenon.,18
184,One does not need to draw exaggerated conclusions from the differences between the left and right hand sides of the brain to accept that humanists and scientists may be different kinds of people.,18
185,Those whose gifts and tastes lie in a certain direction — people who do not have a head for mathematics — may well have been influenced by this in an early career choice.,18
186,"To their dismay they see quantification invading their own subject: they might have become physicists or engineers if English literature, Greek history and even New Testament theology now offer no escape from those wretched numbers.",18
187,"So now the more abstract, intuitive, and ideological branches of the humanities become more attractive.",18
188,"The number of practitioners in these areas grows — largely, , through the genuine fascination of their subjects, but swollen perhaps with an influx of refugees from the relentless advance of technological rigour.",18
189,"There are still, thank God, a few areas where one can work without either having to use computers or feeling guilty because one does not.",18
190,"If this is a correct analysis of the situation, the  for our disciplines may be far-reaching in unexpected ways which are only just beginning to be noticed.",18
191,I would like to end by asking what lessons can be drawn from the successes and the disappointments of recent decades.,18
192,"there are many, but I would like to single out just three.",18
193,"The first is that it is important never to lose sight of the fact that a computer is an assistant to, not a substitute for, a human researcher.",18
194,"Neglect of this obvious truth led to computer programs (say, for language analysis) being regarded as failures if they could not record 100% success.",18
195,"More recently, we have learnt to become grateful for robust programs which will do 95% of the work and leave the human being to make the decisive intervention in the other 5% of cases.",18
196,"A second lesson is that the computerization of a research project fails the  of a particular set of data, it can be an intellectually instructive task to try, and fail, to prepare the data in a formalized manner.",18
197,"And the successful formalization of data can open up questions for research, and types of evidence, which would not have occurred to the research community without the effort to present the data in computer-friendly form.",18
198,The third lesson is that it will not be possible for humanists to take full stock of what the computer has to offer to their disciplines until the study of statistics becomes a normal and inescapable part of the training of those who plan an academic career in the humanities.,18
199,"This needs to be recognized not only at university level (as in France, where now a course of statistics is an essential part of the training of an academic historian) but also in any high school which has an interest in sending on students to do university work in the humanities.",18
200,"There is still a great lack, in every language, of good textbooks designed to teach statistics outside the context of the natural and social sciences.",18
201,"strictly academic consideration, the ordinary citizen of any modern democracy will find an elementary course in statistics of more general educational value than courses in e.g. differential calculus, which are more popular in science-oriented schools.",18
202,One of the unquestionable advantages of the growing use of computers by humanists is that it has done something to bridge the divide between two cultures — scientific and humanist — which many writers have lamented as threatening to fragment the community of scholars and the republic of learning.,18
203,A by-product of the computer revolution has been an increased understanding by scientists and humanists of each others' methods and preoccupations.,18
204,"Surprisingly, in the last decades is that literary studies, perhaps especially classical studies, which may seem to be at the other extreme of the academic spectrum from the sciences, have shown themselves more self confident in the use of computers than history has done, history is closer to the social sciences which have been acclimatized to quantification and computerization.",18
205,"On the other hand, the flight in some literature departments from traditional methods of study, with their emphasis on the detailed analysis of texts, towards theory-laden forms of criticism with an explicit political agenda, is a development which is not favourable to the search for objectively quantifiable features capable of computerized study.",18
206,What will the next decades hold?,18
207,"Will it be seen, with hindsight, that the introduction of the computer into the humanities disciplines has made no more substantial change in the eventual output of research than was made by the introduction of the electric typewriter?",18
208,"Or will there be a flowering of research papers, neither pedestrian nor spectacular, containing solid and original results obtained by techniques for which the computer is indispensable?",18
209,It is hard to make a confident prediction.,18
210,"But the testing time has now arrived; because for the first time posts of leadership in humanities departments are being taken up by a generation of scholars who have been familiar with the computer from their earliest schooldays, scholars who are neither frightened by, nor over-respectful of, the new powers which the computer has brought.",18

2,Introduction: linguistic forms and functions,19
3,The functions of language,19
4,"The analysis of discourse is, necessarily, the analysis of language in use.",19
5,"As such, it cannot be restricted to the description of linguistic forms independent of the purposes or functions which those forms are designed to serve in human affairs.",19
6,"While some linguists may concentrate on determining the formal properties of a language, the discourse analyst is committed to an investigation of what that language is used for.",19
7,"While the formal approach has a long tradition, manifested in innumerable volumes of grammar, the functional approach is less well documented.",19
8,"Attempts to provide even a general set of labels for the principal functions of language have resulted in vague, and often confusing, terminology.",19
9,We will adopt only two terms to describe the major functions of language and emphasise that this division is an analytic convenience.,19
10,"It would be unlikely that, on any occasion, a natural language utterance would be used to fulfil only one function, to the total exclusion of the other.",19
11,That function which language serves in the expression of ‘content’ we will describe as and that function involved in expressing social relations and personal attitudes we will describe as ,19
12,"Our distinction, ‘transactional /interactional’, stands correspondence to the functional dichotomies —‘representative /expressive’, found in Bühler (1934), ‘referential /emotive’(Jakobson, 1960), ‘ideational /interpersonal’(Halliday, 1970b) and ‘descriptive /social-expressive’(Lyons, 1977),",19
13,The transactional view,19
14,Linguists and linguistic philosophers tend to adopt a limited approach to the functions of language in society.,19
15,"While they  frequently acknowledge that language may be used to perform many communicative functions, they nonetheless make the general assumption that the most important function is the communication of information.",19
16,"Thus Lyons (1977: 32) observes that the notion of communication is readily used ‘of feelings, moods and attitudes’ but suggests that he will be primarily interested in ‘the intentional transmission of factual, or propositional, information’.",19
17,Similarly Bennett (1976: 5) remarks ‘it seems likely that communication is primarily a matter of a speaker's seeking either to inform a hearer of something or to enjoin some action upon him’.,19
18,The value of the use of language to transmit information is well embedded in our cultural mythology.,19
19,"We all believe that it is the faculty of language which has enabled the human race to develop diverse cultures, each with its distinctive social customs, religious observances, laws, oral traditions, patterns of trading, .",19
20,"We all believe, moreover, that it is the acquisition of written language which has permitted the development within some of these cultures of philosophy, science and literature (see Goody, 1977).",19
21,"We all believe that this development is made possible by the ability to transfer information through the use of language, which enables man to utilise the knowledge of his forebears, and the knowledge of other men in other cultures.",19
22,We shall call the language which is used to convey ‘factual or propositional information’,19
23,In primarily transactional language we assume that what the speaker (or writer) has primarily in mind is the efficient transference of information.,19
24,Language used in such a situation is primarily ‘message oriented’.,19
25,It is important that the recipient gets the informative detail correct.,19
26,"Thus if a policeman gives directions to a traveller, a doctor tells a nurse how to administer medicine to a patient, a householder puts in an insurance claim, a shop assistant explains the relative merits of two types of knitting wool, or a scientist describes an experiment, in each case it matters that the speaker should make what he says (or writes) clear.",19
27,There will be unfortunate (even disastrous) consequences in the real world if the message is not properly understood by the recipient.,19
28,The interactional view,19
29,"Whereas linguists, philosophers of language and psycho-linguists  have, , paid particular attention to the use of language for the transmission of ‘factual or propositional information’, sociologists and sociolinguists have been particularly concerned with the use of language to establish and maintain social relationships.",19
30,In sociological and anthropological literature the use of language has been frequently commented on — particularly the conventional use of language to open talk-exchanges and to close them.,19
31,"Conversational analysts have been particularly concerned with the use of language to negotiate role-relationships, peer-solidarity, the exchange of turns in a conversation, the saving of face of both speaker and hearer (cf.",19
32,"Labov, 1972a; Brown and Levinson, 1978; Sacks, Schegloff & Jefferson, 1974; Lakoff, 1973).",19
33,It is clearly the case that a great deal of everyday human interaction is characterised by the primarily interpersonal the primarily transactional use of language.,19
34,"When two strangers are standing shivering at a bus-stop in an icy wind and one turns to the other and says ‘My goodness, it's cold’, it is difficult to suppose that the primary intention of the speaker is to convey information.",19
35,It seems much more reasonable to suggest that the speaker is indicating a readiness to be friendly and to talk.,19
36,Indeed a great deal of ordinary everyday conversation appears to consist of one individual commenting on something which is present to both him and his listener.,19
37,The weather is the most quoted example of this in British English.,19
38,However a great deal of casual conversation contains phrases and echoes of phrases which appear more to be intended as contributions to a conversation than to be taken as instances of information-giving.,19
39,"Thus a woman on a bus describing the way a mutual friend has been behaving, getting bed too soon after an operation, concludes her turn in the conversation by saying",19
40,"Aye, she's an awfy woman.",19
41,(awfy = Sc awful),19
42,This might be taken as an informative summary.,19
43,Her neighbour then says reflectively (having been supportively uttering throughout the first speaker's turn):,19
44,"Aye, she's an awfy woman.",19
45,Pirsig remarks of such a conversation: ‘the conversation's pace intrigues me.,19
46,"It isn't intended to go anywhere, just fill  the time of day…on and on and on with no point or purpose to fill the time, like the rocking of a chair.’",19
47,What seems to be primarily at issue here is the sharing of a common point of view.,19
48,"Brown & Levinson point out the importance for social relationships of establishing common ground and agreeing on points of view, and illustrate the lengths to which speakers in different cultures will go to maintain an appearance of agreement, and they remark ‘agreement may also be stressed by part or all of what the preceding speaker has said’(1978:117)",19
49,"Whereas, as we shall note, written language is, , used for primarily transactional purposes, it is possible to find written genres whose purpose is not primarily to inform but to maintain social relationships-'thank you' letters, love letters, games of consequences, etc.",19
50,Spoken and written language,19
51,Manner of production,19
52,"From the point of view of production, it is clear that spoken and written language make somewhat different demands on language-producers.",19
53,"The speaker has available to him the full range of ‘voice quality’ effects (facial expression, postural and gestural systems).",19
54,Armed with these he can always override the effect of the words he speaks.,19
55,"Thus the speaker who says ‘I'd really like to’, leaning forward, smiling, with a ‘warm, breathy’ voice quality, is much more likely to be interpreted as meaning what he says, than another speaker uttering the same words, leaning away, brow puckered, with a ‘sneering, nasal’voice quality.",19
56,These paralinguistic cues are denied to the writer.,19
57,"We shall generally ignore paralinguistic features in spoken language in this book since the data we shall quote from is spoken by co-operative adults who are not exploiting paralinguistic resources against the verbal meanings of their utterances but are, rather, using them to reinforce the meaning.",19
58,"Not only is the speaker controlling the production of communicative systems which are different from those controlled by the writer, he is also processing that production under circumstances which are considerably more demanding.",19
59,"The speaker must monitor what it is that he has just said, and determine whether it  matches his intentions, while he is uttering his current phrase and monitoring that, and simultaneously planning his next utterance and fitting that into the overall pattern of what he wants to say and monitoring, moreover, not only his own performance but its reception by his hearer.",19
60,"He has no permanent record of what he has said earlier, and only under unusual circumstances does he have notes which remind him what he wants to say next.",19
61,"The writer, on the contrary, may look over what he has already written, pause between each word with no fear of his interlocutor interrupting him, take his time in choosing a particular word, even looking it up in the dictionary if necessary, check his progress with his notes, reorder what he has written, and even change his mind about what he wants to say.",19
62,"Whereas the speaker is under considerable pressure to keep on talking during the period allotted to him, the writer is characteristically under no such pressure.",19
63,"Whereas the speaker knows that any words which pass his lips will be heard by his interlocutor and, if they are not what he intends, he will have to undertake active, public ‘repair’, the writer can cross out and rewrite in the privacy of his study.",19
64,"There are, , advantages for the speaker.",19
65,"He can observe his interlocutor and, if he wishes to, modify what he is saying to make it more accessible or acceptable to his hearer.",19
66,The writer has no access to immediate feedback and simply has to imagine the reader's reaction.,19
67,It is interesting to observe the behaviour of individuals when given a choice of conducting a piece of business in person or in writing.,19
68,"Under some circumstances a face-to-face interaction is preferred but, in others, for a variety of different reasons, the individual may prefer to conduct his transaction in writing.",19
69,"Whereas in a spoken interaction the speaker has the advantage of being able to monitor his listener's minute-by-minute reaction to what he says, he also suffers from the disadvantage of exposing his own feelings ('leaking'; Ekman & Friesen, 1969) and of having to speak clearly and concisely and make immediate response to whichever way his interlocutor reacts.",19
70,The representation of discourse: texts,19
71,So far we have considered in very general terms some of the differences in the manner of production of writing and speech.,19
72,"Before we go on to discuss some of the ways in which the forms of  speech and writing differ, we shall consider, in the next two sections, some of the problems of representing written and spoken language.",19
73,We shall place this within a general discussion of what it means to represent ‘a text’.,19
74,"We shall use as a technical term, to refer to the verbal record of a communicative act.",19
75,(For another approach to text cf. discussion in Chapter 6.),19
76,Written texts,19
77,The notion of ‘text’ as a printed record is familiar in the study of literature.,19
78,"A ‘text’ may be differently presented in different editions, with different type-face, on different sizes of paper, in one or two columns, and we still assume, from one edition to the next, that the different presentations all represent the same ‘text’.",19
79,It is important to consider just what it is that is ‘the same’.,19
80,"Minimally, the words should be the same words, presented in the same order.",19
81,"Where there are disputed readings of texts, editors usually feel obliged to comment on the crux; so of Hamlet's",19
82,"O, that this too too sullied flesh would melt (1.",19
83,ii.129),19
84,"Dover Wilson makes it clear that this is an interpretation, since the second Quarto gives ‘too too sallied’ and the first Folio ‘too too solid’(Dover Wilson, 1934).",19
85,"Even where there is no doubt about the identity of words and their correct sequence, replicating these alone does not guarantee an adequate representation of a text.",19
86,Consider the following extract of dialogue from Pride and Prejudice:,19
87,"‘Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?",19
88,You take delight in vexing me.,19
89,You have no compassion on my poor nerves.’,19
90,"‘You mistake me, my dear.",19
91,I have a high respect for your nerves.,19
92,They are my old friends.,19
93,I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years .’,19
94,It is clear that more than simply reproducing the words in their correct order is required.,19
95,"It is necessary to replicate punctuation conventions, the lineation which indicates the change of speaker.",19
96,The extract reads as gobbledygook if it is read as a speech by one individual.,19
97,"An adequate representation of a text must assign speeches to the correct characters, sentences to the correct paragraphs, and paragraphs to the correct chapters.",19
98,The author's organisation and staging of his work must be preserved.,19
99,"In a piece of expository prose, the author's indication of the development of the argument contributes to the reader's experience of the text.",19
100,"Thus titles, chapter headings, sub-divisions and sub-headings all indicate to the reader how the author intends his argument to be chunked.",19
101,The detail of lineation rarely matters in expository or descriptive prose.,19
102,However it clearly becomes crucial in the reproduction of poetry.,19
103,The work of those seventeenth-century poets who created poems in the shape of diamonds or butterflies would be largely incomprehensible if the form were not preserved.,19
104,The notion of ‘text’ reaches beyond the reproduction of printed material in some further printed form.,19
105,"A letter, handwritten in purple ink with many curlicues, may have its text reproduced in printed form.",19
106,"Similarly, neutral printed versions may be produced of handwritten shopping lists, slogans spray-painted hoardings, and public notices embossed on metal plates.",19
107,"In each case the ‘text’ will be held to have been reproduced if the words, the punctuation and, where relevant, the lineation are reproduced accurately.",19
108,"Where the original text exploits typographical variety, a text reproduced in one type-face may lack some of the quality of the original.",19
109,"An obvious example is a newspaper item which may exploit several different type-faces, different sizes of type and a particular shape of lay-out.",19
110,It is interesting to observe that publishers regularly reproduce conscious manipulation of the written medium the writer.,19
111,Thus Jane Austen's expression of contrast is reproduced by publishers in italics:,19
112,"‘Nay,’ said Elizabeth, ‘this is not fair.",19
113,"You wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body.",19
114,I only want to think you …’,19
115,Similarly Queen Victoria's use of underlining in her handwritten journal is represented by her publishers in the printed version with an italic type-face to represent the emphasis she wishes to indicate when writing of Lord Melbourne:,19
116,"he gave me a kind, and I may say,look (Thursday, 28 June 1838)",19
117,"Where the writer is deliberately exploiting the resources of the written medium, it seems reasonable to suggest that that manipulation constitutes part of the text.",19
118,A further illustration of this is to be found in the conventions governing spelling.,19
119,we assume that words have a standardised spelling in British English.,19
120,The fact of the standardisation enables authors to manipulate idiosyncratic spelling to achieve special effects.,19
121,"Thus in the publishers reproduce the notice outside Owl's house in one inset line, using capitals, and with the author's own spelling:",19
122,PLEZ CNOKE IF AN RNSR IS NOT REQID,19
123,The point that the author makes with this particular spelling would be lost if the words were reproduced in their standard form.,19
124,"It might then be claimed that such a form of the text was incomplete or inadequate, because the point which the author wishes to make is accessible from the written text.",19
125,Indeed the importance of the correct citing of an author's spelling is regularly marked by the insertion of sic into a citation by a second author who wishes to disclaim responsibility for an aberrant spelling.,19
126,"We have so far been making the simplifying assumption that it is clear, in all cases, what the original text consists of.",19
127,"Where handwritten texts are at issue, it is often the case that the individual reproducing the text in a printed version has to make a considerable effort of interpretation to assign a value to some of the less legible words.",19
128,"In literature, as we have remarked already, uncertainty may give rise to cruces, to disputed texts.",19
129,"In letters, prescriptions, shopping lists, school essays, the reader normally pushes through a once-for-all interpretation of a text which may never be read again.",19
130,"It must be clear however, that a printed version of a handwritten text is, in an important sense, an interpretation.",19
131,"This is particularly clear in the handwritten attempts of very young children where the adult is obliged to assign each large painstakingly formed letter token to a particular type of letter, which he may then re-interpret the larger message.",19
132,Thus we have before us a page with a drawing of a large animal (reported to be a lion) and a table with a goldfish bowl on it.,19
133,The five-year-old writes below what might be transliterated as:,19
134,1,19
135,the lion wos the fish to ti it,19
136,2,19
137,the cat wants to get dwon the steis,19
138,3,19
139,with qwt to dsthhb thelion,19
140,A possible of the text thus represented might be:,19
141,"The lion wants the fish, to eat it.",19
142,The cat wants to get down the stairs without to disturb the lion.,19
143,"The transliteration of the original with in line 3, reasonably accurately represents the first letter (which might also be represented as a figure nine if nine has a straight back stroke).",19
144,A more charitable and transliteration would render it as (i.e. ‘unhatted’with a long backstroke (a.,19
145,"). We shall return to the problem of the interpretive work of the reader /listener in identifying the words which constitute the text, in the next section.",19
146,Spoken texts,19
147,The problems encountered with the notion of ‘text’ as the verbal record of a communicative act become more complex when we consider what is meant by spoken ‘text’.,19
148,The simplest view to assume is that a tape-recording of a communicative act will preserve the ‘text’.,19
149,"The tape-recording may also preserve that may be extraneous to the text — coughing, chairs creaking, buses going past, the scratch of a match lighting a cigarette.",19
150,"We shall insist that these events do not constitute part of the text (though they may form part of the relevant context, cf.",19
151,Chapter 2).,19
152,"the discourse analyst works with a tape-recording of an event, from which he then makes a written transcription, annotated his interests on a particular occasion — transcriptions of the sort which will appear in this book.",19
153,"He has to determine what constitutes the verbal event, and what form he will transcribe it in.",19
154,Unless the analyst produces a fine-grained phonetic transcription (which very few people would be able to read fluently) details of accent and pronunciation are lost.,19
155,", analysts represent speech using normal orthographic conventions.",19
156,The analyst may hear an utterance which might be transcribed phonemically as /greipbritn /.,19
157,Is he to render this orthographically as ,19
158,Hardly.,19
159,"He will interpret what he hears and normalise to the  conventional orthographic form inserting conventional word boundaries in the orthographic version which do not, , exist in the acoustic signal.",19
160,"If he hears a form /gene /, is he to render this in the orthography as (which for some readers may have a peculiarly American association) or or ",19
161,"The problem is a very real one, because most speakers constantly simplify words phonetically in the stream of speech (see Brown, 1977: ch. 4).",19
162,"If the analyst normalises to the conventional written form, the words take on a formality and specificity which necessarily misrepresent the spoken form.",19
163,Problems with representing the segmental record of the words spoken pale into insignificance compared with the problems of representing the suprasegmental record (details of intonation and rhythm).,19
164,"We have no standard conventions for representing the paralinguistic features of the utterance which are summarised as ‘voice quality’, yet the effect of an utterance being said kindly and sympathetically is clearly very different from the effect if it is said brutally and harshly.",19
165,"Similarly it is usually possible to determine from a speaker's voice his or her sex, approximate age and educational status, some aspects of state of health and personality (see Abercrombie, I968; Laver, 1980).",19
166,It is not customary to find any detail relating to these indexical features of the speaker in transcriptions by discourse analysts.,19
167,", too, rhythmic and temporal features of speech are ignored in transcriptions; the rhythmic structure which appears to bind some groups of words more closely together than others, and the speeding up and slowing down of the overall pace of speech the speaker's normal pace in a given speech situation, are such complex variables that we have very little idea how they are exploited in speech and to what effect (but, cf.",19
168,"Butterworth, 1980).",19
169,"It seems reasonable to suggest, though, that these variables, together with pause and intonation, perform the functions in speech that punctuation, , , paragraphing etc. perform in written language.",19
170,"If they constitute part of the textual record in written language, they should be included as part of the textual record in spoken language.",19
171,"If it is relevant to indicate Queen Victoria's underlining, then it is surely also relevant to indicate, , a speaker's use of high pitch and loudness to indicate emphasis.",19
172,The response of most analysts to this complex problem is to present their transcriptions of the spoken text using the conventions of the written language.,19
173,Thus Cicourel (1973) reproduces three utterances recorded in a classroom in the following way:,19
174,1,19
175,Ci: Like this?,19
176,2,19
177,"T: Okay, yeah, , now…",19
178,3,19
179,Ri:what are we going to do?,19
180,"In I and 3 we have to assume that the? indicates that the utterance functions as a question — whether it is formally marked by, , rising intonation in the case of I, we are not told.",19
181,"Similarly the status of commas in the speech of the T(eacher) is not made explicit — presumably they are to indicate pauses in the stream of speech, but it may be that they simply indicate a complex of rhythmic and intonational cues which the analyst is responding to.",19
182,What must be clear in a transcript of this kind is that a great deal of interpretation by the analyst has gone on before the reader encounters this ‘data’.,19
183,"If the analyst chooses to italicise a word in his transcription to indicate, , the speaker's high pitch and increased loudness, he has performed an interpretation on the acoustic signal, an interpretation which, he has decided, is in effect equivalent to a writer's underlining of a word to indicate emphasis.",19
184,"There is a sense, then, in which the analyst is creating the text which others will read.",19
185,"In this creation of the written version of the spoken text he makes appeal to conventional modes of interpretation which, he believes, are shared by other speakers of the language.",19
186,"It must be further emphasised that, however objective the notion of ‘text’ may appear as we have defined it ('the verbal record of a communicative act'), the perception and interpretation of each text is essentially subjective.",19
187,Different individuals pay attention to different aspects of texts.,19
188,The content of the text appeals to them or fits into their experience differently.,19
189,"In discussing texts we idealise this variability of the experiencing of the text and assume what Schutz has called ‘the reciprocity of perspective’, whereby we take it for granted that readers of a text or listeners to a text share the same experience (Schutz, 1953).",19
190,Clearly for a great  deal of ordinary everyday language this assumption of an amount of overlap of point of view sufficient to allow mutual comprehension is necessary.,19
191,however we are brought to a halt by different interpretations of ‘the same text’.,19
192,"This is particularly the case when critical attention is being  on details of spoken language which were only ever intended by the speaker as ephemeral parts, relatively unimportant, of the working-out of what he wanted to say.",19
193,It seems fair to suggest that discourse analysis of spoken language is particularly prone to over-analysis.,19
194,"A text frequently has a much wider variety of interpretations imposed upon it by analysts studying it at their leisure, than would ever have been possible for the participants in the communicative interaction which gives rise to the ‘text’.",19
195,"Once the analyst has ‘created’ a written transcription from a recorded spoken version, the written text is available to him in just the way a literary text is available to the literary critic.",19
196,"It is important to remember, when we discuss spoken ‘texts’, the transitoriness of the original.",19
197,It must be clear that our simple definition of ‘text’ as ‘the verbal record of a communicative act’requires two hedges:,19
198,i,19
199,"the representation of a text which is presented for discussion may , particularly where the written representation of a spoken text is involved, consist of a prior analysis (hence interpretation) of a fragment of discourse by the discourse analyst presenting the text for consideration",19
200,ii,19
201,"features of the original production of the language, shaky handwriting or quavering speech, are somewhat arbitrarily considered as features of the text features of the context in which the language is produced.",19
202,The relationship between speech and writing,19
203,"The view that written language and spoken language serve, , quite different functions in society has been forcefully propounded, hardly surprisingly, by scholars whose main interest lies in anthropology and sociology.",19
204,"Thus Goody & Watt (1963) and Goody (1977) suggest that analytic thinking  followed the acquisition of written language ‘since it was the setting down of speech that enabled man clearly to separate words, to manipulate their order and to develop syllogistic forms of reasoning’(Goody, 1977: 11).",19
205,"Goody goes on to make even larger claims about the ways in which the acquisition of writing, which permits man to reflect upon what he has thought, has permitted the development of cognitive structures which are not available to the non-literate (cf. also the views of Vygotsky, 1962).",19
206,"He examines the use of ‘figures of the written word’ in various cultures, particularly the ‘non-speech uses of language’which develop systems of classification like lists, formulae, tables and ‘recipes for the organisation and development of human knowledge’(1977: 17).",19
207,"Goody suggests that written language has two main functions: the first is the storage function which permits communication over time and space, and the second is that which ‘shifts language from the oral to the visual domain' and permits words and sentences to be examined their original contexts, ‘where they appear in a very different and highly ‘abstract’ context' (1977: 78).",19
208,"It seems reasonable to suggest that, whereas in daily life in a literate culture, we use speech largely for the establishment and maintenance of human relationships (primarily interactional use), we use written language largely for the working and transference of information (primarily transactional use).",19
209,"However, there are occasions when speech is used for the detailed transmission of factual information.",19
210,"It is noteworthy, then, that the recipient often writes down the details that he is told.",19
211,"So a doctor writes down his patient's symptoms, an architect writes down his client's requirements, Hansard records the proceedings of the British Parliament, we write down friends' addresses, telephone numbers, recipes, knitting patterns, .",19
212,"When the recipient is not expected to write down the details, it is often the case that the speaker repeats them sometimes several times over.",19
213,"Consider the typical structure of a news broadcast which opens with the ‘headlines’— a set of summary statements — which are followed by a news item that consists of an expansion and repetition of the first headline, in which is embedded a comment from ‘our man on the spot’ that recapitulates the main points again, then, at the end of the broadcast, there is a repetition of the set of headlines.",19
214,"There is a general expectation that people will not remember detailed facts  correctly if they are only exposed to them in the spoken mode, especially if they are required to remember them over an extended period of time.",19
215,"This aspect of communication is obviously what written language is supremely good at, whether for the benefit of the individual in remembering the private paraphernalia of daily life, or for the benefit of nations in establishing constitutions, laws and treaties with other nations.",19
216,The major differences between speech and writing derive from the fact that one is essentially transitory and the other is designed to be permanent.,19
217,"It is exactly this point which D. J. Enright makes in the observation that ‘Plato may once have thought more highly of speech than of writing, but I doubt he does now!’",19
218,"(Review in , 24 January 1982).",19
219,Differences in form between written and spoken language,19
220,It is not our intention here to discuss the many different forms of spoken language which can be identified even within one geographical area like Britain.,19
221,"Clearly there are dialectal differences, accent differences, ‘register’ differences variables like the topic of discussion and the roles of the participants (see e.g. Trudgill, 1974 and Hudson, 1980 for discussion of these sorts of differences).",19
222,"There is however, one further distinction which is rarely noted, but which it is important to draw attention to here.",19
223,"That is the distinction between the speech of those whose language is highly influenced by long and constant Immersion in written language forms, and the speech of those whose language is relatively uninfluenced by written forms of language.",19
224,"It is the case that it is the speech of the first set whose language tends to be described in descriptions of the language (grammars), since descriptions are typically written by middle-aged people who have spent long years reading written language.",19
225,"In particular situations the speech of, say, an academic, particularly if he is saying something he has said or thought about before, may have a great deal written language forms.",19
226,"For the majority of the population, even of a ‘literate’ country, spoken language will have very much less the written language.",19
227,"This, again, is a point appreciated by Goody: ‘Some individuals spend more time with the written language than they do with the spoken.",19
228,the effects on their own  personalities…what are the effects on language?,19
229,How do written languages differ from spoken ones?’(1977: 124).,19
230,"In the discussion which follows we shall draw a simplistic distinction between spoken and written language which takes highly literate written language as the norm of written language, and the speech of those who have not spent many years exposed to written language (a set which will include most young undergraduate students) as the norm for spoken language.",19
231,"In 1.2.1 we discussed some of the differences in the manner of production of speech and writing, differences which often contribute significantly to characteristic forms in written language characteristic forms in speech.",19
232,"The overall effect is to produce speech which is less richly organised than written language, containing less densely packed information, but containing more interactive markers and planning ‘fillers’.",19
233,"The standard descriptive grammars of English (e.g. Quirk, Greenbaum, Leech & Svartvik, 1972) typically describe features of the written language, or that form of the spoken language which is highly influenced by written language.",19
234,"From the descriptive work of a number of scholars studying spoken language (e.g. Labov, 1972a; Sinclair & Coulthard, 1975; Chafe, 1979; Ochs, 1979; Cicourel, 1981; Goffman, 1981) we can extract some (all) features which characterise spoken language:",19
235,a,19
236,the syntax of spoken language is typically much less structured than that of written language,19
237,i,19
238,"spoken language contains many incomplete sentences, often simply sequences",19
239,ii,19
240,spoken language typically contains rather little subordination,19
241,iii,19
242,"in conversational speech, where sentential syntax can be observed, active declarative forms are normally found.",19
243,"In over 50 hours of recorded conversational speech, Brown, Currie and Kenworthy (1980) found very few examples of passives, it-clefts or wh-clefts.",19
244,Crystal(1980) also presents some of the problems encountered in attempting to analyse spontaneous speech categories like and ,19
245,"As a brief example, notice how this speaker pauses and begins each new ‘sentence’ before formally completing the previous one:",19

248,"in written language an extensive set of metalingual markers exists to mark relationships between clauses complementisers,temporal markers, so-called ‘logical connectors’ like etc.), in spoken language the largely paratactically organised chunks are related by and, more rarely,",19
249,The speaker is typically less explicit than the writer:(because),19
250,"In written language rhetorical organisers of larger stretches of discourse appear, like and ",19
251,These are rare in spoken language.,19
252,c,19
253,"In written language, rather heavily premodified noun phrases (like that one) are quite common — it is rare in spoken language to find two premodifying adjectives and there is a strong tendency to structure the short chunks of speech only one predicate is attached to a given referent at a time (simple case-frame or one-place predicate) as in:or in:.",19
254,"The packaging of information related to a particular referent can, in the written language, be very concentrated, as in the following news item:",19
255,"(Edinburgh), 22 April 1982)",19
256,d,19
257,"Whereas written language sentences are generally structured in subject-predicate form, in spoken language it is  quite common to find what Givo/1n (1979b) calls topic-comment structure, as in .",19
258,e,19
259,"in informal speech, the occurrence of passive constructions is relatively infrequent.",19
260,That use of the passive in written language which allows non-attribution of agency is typically absent from conversational speech.,19
261,"Instead, active constructions with indeterminate group agents are noticeable, as in:",19
262,f,19
263,"in chat about the immediate environment, the speaker may rely on (e.g.) gaze direction to supply a referent:(looking at the rain) frightful isn't it.",19
264,g,19
265,the speaker may replace or refine expressions as he goes along:,19
266,h,19
267,the speaker typically uses a good deal of rather generalised vocabulary:and .,19
268,i,19
269,"the speaker frequently repeats the same syntactic form several times over, as this fairground inspector does: I ",19
270,j,19
271,the speaker may produce a large number of prefabricated ‘fillers’:.,19
272,Some of the typical distinctions between discourse which has been written and that which has been spoken can be seen in the following two descriptions of a rainbow.,19
273,"(No direct comparison is intended, since the two pieces of discourse were produced in strictly non-comparable circumstances for very different purposes.)",19
274,"And then, in the blowing clouds, she saw a band of faint iridescence colouring in faint shadows a portion of the hill.",19
275,"And forgetting, startled, she looked for the hovering colour and saw a rainbow forming itself.",19
276,"In one place it gleamed fiercely, and, her heart anguished with hope, she sought the shadow of iris where the bow should be.",19
277,"Steadily the colour gathered, mysteriously, from nowhere, it took presence upon itself, there was a faint, vast rainbow.",19
278,"(D. H. Lawrence,, chapter 16)",19
279,"In the first extract (I), the rich lexis and well-organised structure are indications that the writer has taken time in the construction, and possibly reconstruction after several rewritings, of the final product.",19
280,"There are complete sentences, containing subordinations, frequent modifications via adjectives and adverbs, and more than single predicates per referential expression.",19
281,"In extract (2), there are frequent pauses, often interrupting major syntactic units, repetitions, incomplete sentences, generalised vocabulary, fillers and one example of a tongue-slip.",19
282,normally after + very heavy rain + or something like that + and + you're driving along the road + and + far away + you see + well + er + a series + of + stripes + + formed like a bow + an arch + + very very far away + ah + seven colours but + + I guess you hardly ever see seven it's just a + a series of + colours which + they seem to be separate but if you try to look for the separate (kAz)— colours they always seem + very hard + to separate + if you see what I mean ++ (Postgraduate student speaking informally),19
283,"The speaker planning in the here-and-now, possibly threatened with his interlocutor wanting to take a turn, typically repeats himself , using the same syntactic structure, the same lexical items, using the first word that comes to mind hunting for the filling in pauses with ‘fillers’.",19
284,The overall effect is of information produced in a much less dense manner than is characteristic of written language.,19
285,We must assume that the density of information packing in spoken language is appropriate for the listener to process comfortably.,19
286,Most people have experienced expository prose read aloud which they have found difficult to follow in the spoken mode.,19
287,Few people can extract from a lecture which is read aloud with no visual support.,19
288,"Goody  points out that the written form of language releases us from the linear experiential mode: ‘the fact that it takes a visual form means that one can escape from the problem of the succession of events in time, by backtracking, skipping, looking to see who-done-it before we know what it is they did.",19
289,"Who, except the most obsessive academic, reads a book as he hears speech?",19
290,"Who, except the most avant-garde of modern dramatists, attempts to write as they speak?’(1977:124).",19
291,Sentence and utterance,19
292,"It might seem reasonable to propose that the features of spoken language outlined in the preceding section should be considered as features of utterances, and those features typical of written language as characteristic of sentences.",19
293,"In this convenient distinction, we can say, in a fairly non-technical way, that utterances are spoken and sentences are written and that we will apply these terms to what Lyons describes as ‘the products of ordinary language-behaviour’.",19
294,In the case of the term it is important to be clear about the type of object one is referring to.,19
295,Lyons makes a distinction between ‘text-sentences’ and ‘system-sentences’.,19
296,He describes the latter in the following way:,19
297,system-sentences never occur as the products of ordinary language-behaviour.,19
298,Representations of system-sentences may be used in metalinguistic discussion of the structure and functions of language: and it is such representations that are customarily cited in grammatical descriptions of particular languages.,19
299,"(Lyons, 1977:31)",19
300,"Since the linguistic exemplification presented our discussion throughout this book is overwhelmingly drawn from ‘ordinary language behaviour’, we shall generally employ the term ‘sentence’ in the ‘text-sentence’, and not the ‘system-sentence’sense.",19
301,"Although the linguist who undertakes the analysis of discourse has ultimately the same aims as a linguist who uses ‘system-sentences’ in his grammatical description of a language, there are important methodological differences involved in the two approaches.",19
302,Both linguists wish to produce accurate descriptions of the particular language studied.,19
303,"this goal, the  grammarian will concentrate on a particular body of data and attempt to produce an exhaustive but economical set of rules which will account for all and only the acceptable sentences in his data.",19
304,"He will not normally seek to account for the mental processes involved in any language-user's production of those sentences, nor to describe the physical or social contexts in which those sentences occur.",19
305,"On each of these issues, concerning ‘data’, ‘rules’, ‘processes’ and ‘contexts’, the discourse analyst will take a different view.",19
306,On ‘data',19
307,"The grammarian's ‘data’ is inevitably the single sentence, or a set of single sentences illustrating a particular feature of the language being studied.",19
308,It is also typically the case that the grammarian will have constructed the sentence or sentences he uses as examples.,19
309,"This procedure is not often made explicit, but an overt commitment to the constructed-data approach has recently been expressed in the following terms:",19
310,I shall assume…that invented strings and certain intuitive judgements about them constitute legitimate data for linguistic research.,19
311,"(Gazdar, 1979: 11)",19
312,"In contrast, the analysis of discourse, as undertaken and exemplified in this book, is typically based on the linguistic output of someone the analyst.",19
313,"On the few occasions where constructed data is used as illustration (of a paradigm, , in Chapter 4), it is inevitably directed towards accounting for the range of formal options available to a speaker or writer.",19
314,"More typically, the discourse analyst's ‘data’ is taken from written texts or tape-recordings.",19
315,It is rarely in the form of a single sentence.,19
316,"This type of linguistic material is sometimes described as ‘performance-data’ and may contain features hesitations, slips, and non-standard forms which a linguist like Chomsky (1965) believed should not have to be accounted for in the grammar of a language.",19
317,"Although these two views of ‘data’ differ substantially, they are not incompatible, unless they are taken in an extreme form.",19
318,"A discourse analyst may regularly work with extended extracts of conversational speech, , but he does not consider his data in isolation from the descriptions and insights provided by sentence-grammarians.",19
319,"It should be the case that a linguist who is  primarily interested in the analysis of discourse is, in some sense, also a sentence-grammarian.",19
320,"Similarly, the sentence-grammarian cannot remain immured from the discourse he encounters in his daily life.",19
321,"The sentence he constructs to illustrate a particular linguistic feature must, in some sense, derive from the ‘ordinary language’ of his daily life and also be acceptable in it.",19
322,A dangerously extreme view of ‘relevant data’ for a discourse analyst would involve denying the admissibility of a constructed sentence as linguistic data.,19
323,Another would be an analytic approach to data which did not require that there should be linguistic evidence in the data to support analytic claims.,19
324,We shall return to the issue of ‘relevant data’ for discourse analysis in Chapter 2.,19
325,"An over-extreme view of what counts as data for the sentence-grammarian was, Sampson (1980), noticeable in some of the early work of generative grammarians.",19
326,"Chomsky gave an indication of the narrowness of view which could be taken, when, immediately before his conclusion that ‘grammar is autonomous’, he stated:",19
327,"Despite the undeniable interest and importance of semantic and statistical studies of language, they appear to have no direct relevance to the problem of determining or characterising the set of grammatical utterances.",19
328,"(Chomsky, 1957: 17)",19
329,The essential problem in an extreme version of the constructed-sentence approach occurs when the resulting sentences are tested only against the linguist's introspection.,19
330,"This can (and occasionally did) lead to a situation in which a linguist claims that the ‘data’ he is using illustrates acceptable linguistic strings because he says it does, as a result of personal introspection, and regardless of how many voices arise in disagreement.",19
331,"The source of this problem, as Sampson (1980: 153) points out, is that the narrow restriction of ‘data’ to constructed sentences and personal introspection leads to a ‘non-testability’, in principle, of any claims made.",19
332,"One outcome of this narrow view of data is that there is a concentration on ‘artificially contrived sentences isolated from their communicative context’(see Preface to Givón (ed.), 1979).",19
333,"Although we shall appeal frequently, in the course of this book, to the insights of sentence grammarians, including those working within a generative framework, we shall avoid as far as possible the methodology which depends on what Lyons (I968) described as regularised, standardised and decontextualised data.",19
334,Rules versus regularities,19
335,A corollary to the restricted data approach found in much of Chomskyan linguistics is the importance placed on writing of grammar which are fixed and true 100% of the time.,19
336,"Just as the grammarian's ‘data’ cannot contain any variable phenomena, so the grammar must have categorial rules, and not ‘rules’which are true only some of the time.",19
337,"It is typical of arguments concerning the ‘correct rules’ of the language in the Chomskyan approach, and that of most other sentence-grammarians, that they are based on the presentation of ‘example’and ‘counterexample’.",19
338,"After all, a single (accepted) sentence, which is presented as a counterexample, can be enough to invalidate a rule of the categorial type.",19
339,"In this sense, the ‘rules’ of grammar appear to be treated in the same way as ‘laws’in the physical sciences.",19
340,This restricts the applicability of such rules since it renders them unavailable to any linguist interested in diachronic change or synchronic variation in a language.,19
341,"It should be emphasised that this is an extreme version of the sentence-grammarian's view and one which is found less frequently, in contemporary linguistics, than it was fifteen years ago.",19
342,"The discourse analyst, with his ‘ordinary language’ data, is committed to quite a different view of the rule-governed aspects of a language.",19
343,"Indeed, he may wish to discuss, not ‘rules’ but simply because his data constantly exemplifies non-categorial phenomena.",19
344,The regularities which the analyst describes are based on the frequency with which a particular linguistic feature occurs under certain conditions in his discourse data.,19
345,"If the frequency of occurrence is very high, then the phenomenon described may appear to be categorial.",19
346,As Givón says:,19
347,what is the communicative difference between a rule of 90% fidelity and one of 100% fidelity?,19
348,"In psychological terms, nothing.",19
349,"In communication, a system with go% categorial fidelity is a highly efficient system.",19
350,"(Givón, 1979a: 28)",19
351,Yet the frequency of occurrence need not be as high as 90% to qualify as a regularity.,19
352,"The discourse analyst, like the experimental psychologist, is mainly interested in the level of frequency which reaches significance in perceptual terms.",19
353,"Thus, a regularity in discourse is a linguistic feature which occurs in a definable environment with a significant frequency.",19
354,"In trying to determine such  regularities, the discourse analyst will typically adopt the traditional methodology of descriptive linguistics.",19
355,"He will attempt to describe the linguistic forms which occur in his data, the environments in which they occur.",19
356,"In this sense, discourse analysis is, like descriptive linguistics, a way of studying language.",19
357,"It may be regarded as a set of techniques, a theoretically predetermined system for the writing of linguistic ‘rules’.",19
358,The discourse analyst attempts to regularities in his data and to them.,19
359,Product versus process,19
360,"The regularities which the discourse analyst describes will normally be expressed in dynamic, not static, terms.",19
361,"Since the data investigated is the result of ‘ordinary language behaviour’, it is likely to contain evidence of the ‘behaviour’ element.",19
362,", unless we believe that language-users present with prefabricated chunks of linguistic strings (sentences), after the fashion of Swift's professors at the grand academy of Lagado part chapter 5), then we must assume that the data we investigate is the result of active processes.",19
363,"The sentence-grammarian does not take account of this, since his data is not connected to behaviour.",19
364,"His data consists of a set of objects called ‘the well-formed sentences of a language’, which can exist independently of any individual speaker of that language.",19
365,"We shall characterise such a view as the view, and note that such sentence-objects have no producers and no receivers.",19
366,"Moreover, they need not be considered function, as evidenced in this statement by Chomsky (I968: 62):",19
367,"If we hope to understand human language and the psychological capacities on which it rests, we must first ask what it is, not how or for what purposes it is used.",19
368,"A less extreme, but certainly related, view of natural language sentences can also be found elsewhere in the literature which relates to discourse analysis.",19
369,"In this view, there are producers and receivers of sentences, or extended texts, but the analysis concentrates solely on the product, , the words-on-the-page.",19
370,Much of the analytic work undertaken in ‘Textlinguistics’ is of this type.,19
371,"Typical of such an approach is the ‘cohesion’ view of the relationships between sentences in a printed text (e.g. the approach in Halliday & Hasan, 1976).",19
372,"In this view, cohesive ties exist between elements in connected sentences of a text in such a way that one word or phrase is linked to other words or phrases.",19
373,"Thus, an anaphoric element a pronoun is treated as a word which substitutes for, or refers back to, another word or words.",19
374,Although there are claims that cohesive links in texts are used by text-producers to facilitate reading or comprehension by text-receivers (cf.,19
375,"Rochester & Martin 1977, 1979; Källgren, 1979), the analysis of the ‘product’, i.e. the printed text itself, does not involve any consideration of how the product is produced or how it is received.",19
376,We shall describe such an approach as deriving from a view.,19
377,This view does not take account of those principles which constrain the production and those which constrain the interpretation of texts.,19
378,"In contrast to these two broadly defined approaches, the view taken in this book is best characterised as a view.",19
379,The distinction between treating discourse as ‘product’ or ‘process’has already been made by Widdowson (1979b: 71).,19
380,"We shall consider words, phrases and sentences which appear in the textual record of a discourse to be evidence of an attempt by a producer (speaker /writer) to communicate his message to a recipient (hearer /reader).",19
381,"We shall be particularly interested in discussing how a recipient might come to comprehend the producer's intended message on a particular occasion, and how the requirements of the particular recipient(s), in definable circumstances, influence the organisation of the producer's discourse.",19
382,"This is clearly an approach which takes the communicative function of language as its primary area of investigation and consequently seeks to describe linguistic form, not as a static object, but as a dynamic means of expressing intended meaning.",19
383,There are several arguments against the static concept of language to be found in both the ‘sentence-as-object’ and ‘text-as-product’approaches.,19
384,", Wittgenstein (1953: 132) warns that ‘the confusions that occupy us arise when language is like an engine idling, not when it is doing work’.",19
385,"In the course of describing how a sentence-as-object approach, based exclusively on syntactic descriptions, fails to account for a variety of sentential  structures, Kuno (1976) concludes that ‘it is time to re-examine every major syntactic constraint from a functional point of view’.",19
386,"Similar conclusions are expressed by Creider (1979), Givóon (1976, 1979b), Rommetveit (1974) and Tyler (1978).",19
387,"In criticising the text-as-product view of cohesion in text, Morgan (1979) argues that we see a link between a particular pronoun and a full noun phrase in a text because we assume the text is coherent and not because the pronoun ‘refers back’ to the noun phrase.",19
388,"We seek to identify the writer's intended referent for a pronoun, since a pronoun can, in effect, be used to refer to almost anything.",19
389,", what the textual record means is determined by our interpretation of what the producer intended it to mean.",19
390,"The discourse analyst, then, is interested in the function or purpose of a piece of linguistic data and also in how that data is processed, both by the producer and by the receiver.",19
391,It is a natural consequence that the discourse analyst will be interested in the results of psycholinguistic processing experiments in a way which is not typical of the sentence-grammarian.,19
392,It also follows that the work of those sociolinguists and ethnographers who attempt to discuss language user's purposes will also be of interest.,19
393,"In the course of this book, we shall appeal to evidence in the psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic literature which offers insights into the way in which discourse, produced in describable contexts for recognisable purposes, is processed and comprehended.",19
394,On ‘context',19
395,"We have constantly referred to the ‘environment’, ‘circumstances’ or in which language is used.",19
396,In Chapter 2 we shall explore the problem of specifying the relevant context.,19
397,Here we simply remark that in recent years the idea that a linguistic string (a sentence) can be fully analysed without taking ‘context’ into account has been seriously questioned.,19
398,"If the sentence-grammarian wishes to make claims about the ‘acceptability’ of a sentence in determining whether the strings produced by his grammar are correct sentences of the language, he is implicitly appealing to contextual considerations.",19
399,"After all, what do we do when we are asked whether a particular string is ‘acceptable’?",19
400,"Do we not immediately, and quite naturally, set about constructing  some circumstances (i.e. a ‘context’) in which the sentence could be acceptably used?",19
401,"Any analytic approach in linguistics which involves contextual considerations, necessarily belongs to that area of language study called ",19
402,"‘Doing discourse analysis’ certainly involves ‘doing syntax and semantics’, but it primarily consists of ‘doing pragmatics’.",19
403,"When the principles which we have expounded in 1.3 are placed alongside Morris's definition of pragmatics as ‘the relations of signs to interpreters’(1938: 6), the connection becomes quite clear.",19
404,"In discourse analysis, as in pragmatics, we are concerned with what people using language are doing, and accounting for the linguistic features in the discourse as the means employed in what they are doing.",19
405,"In summary, the discourse analyst treats his data as the record (text) of a dynamic process in which language was used as an instrument of communication in a context by a speaker /writer to express meanings and achieve intentions (discourse).",19
406,"Working from this data, the analyst seeks to describe regularities in the linguistic realisations used by people to communicate those meanings and intentions.",19
407,2,19
408,The role of context in interpretation,19
409,Pragmatics and discourse context,19
410,"In Chapter I, we emphasised that the discourse analyst necessarily takes a pragmatic approach to the study of language in use.",19
411,Such an approach brings into consideration a number of issues which do not generally receive much attention in the formal linguist's description of sentential syntax and semantics.,19
412,"We noted, , that the discourse analyst has to take account of the context in which a piece of discourse occurs.",19
413,Some of the most obvious linguistic elements which require contextual information for their interpretation are the deictic forms and ,19
414,"to interpret these elements in a piece of discourse, it is necessary to know () who the speaker and hearer are, and the time and place of the production of the discourse.",19
415,In this chapter we shall discuss these and other aspects of contextual description which are required in the analysis of discourse.,19
416,"There are, however, other ways in which the discourse analyst's approach to linguistic data differs from that of the formal linguist and leads to a specialised use of certain terms.",19
417,"Because the analyst is investigating the use of language in context by a speaker /writer, he is more concerned with the relationship between the speaker and the utterance, on the particular occasion of use, than with the potential relationship of one sentence to another, regardless of their use.",19
418,", in using terms the discourse analyst is describing what speakers and hearers are doing, and not the relationship which exists between one sentence or proposition and another.",19
419,Reference,19
420,"In presenting the traditional semantic view of reference, Lyons (I968: 404) says that ‘the relationship which holds between words and things is the relationship of words things’.",19
421,"This traditional view continues to be expressed in those linguistic studies (e.g. lexical semantics) which describe the relationship between a language and the world, in the absence of language-users.",19
422,"Yet, Lyons, in a more recent statement on the nature of reference, makes the following point: ‘it is the speaker who refers (by using some appropriate expression): he invests the expression with reference by the act of referring’(1977: 177).",19
423,It is exactly this latter view of the nature of reference which the discourse analyst has to appeal to.,19
424,"There is support for such a pragmatic concept of reference in Strawson's (1950) claim that ‘'referring’ is not something an expression does; it is something that someone can use an expression to do'; and in Searle's view that ‘in the sense in which speakers refer, expressions do not refer any more than they make promises or give orders’(1979: 155).",19
425,"Thus, in discourse analysis, reference is treated as an action the speaker /writer.",19
426,"In the following conversational fragment, we shall say, , that speaker A uses the expressions and to refer to one individual and and to refer to another.",19
427,"We will not, , say that ‘refers to’.",19
428,(I),19
429,A: my uncle's coming home from Canada on Sunday + he's due in +,19
430,B: how long has he been away for or has he just been away?,19
431,A: Oh no they lived in Canada eh he was married to my mother's sister + + well she's been dead for a number of years now +,19
432,The complex nature of discourse reference will be investigated in greater detail in Chapters 5 and 6.,19
433,Presupposition,19
434,"In the preceding conversational fragment (I), we shall also say that speaker A treats the information that she has an uncle  as presupposed and speaker B, in her question, indicates that she has accepted this presupposition.",19
435,"We shall take the view that the notion of presupposition required in discourse analysis is pragmatic presupposition, , ‘defined assumptions the speaker makes about what the hearer is likely to accept without challenge’(Givón, 1979a: 50).",19
436,The notion of assumed ‘common ground’ is also involved in such a characterisation of presupposition and can be found in this definition by Stalnaker (1978: 321):,19
437,presuppositions are what is taken by the speaker to be the common ground of the participants in the conversation.,19
438,"Notice that, in both these quotations, the indicated source of presuppositions is the speaker.",19
439,"Consequently, we shall, as with reference, avoid attributing presuppositions to sentences or propositions.",19
440,"Thus, we can see little practical use, in the analysis of discourse, for the notion of logical presupposition which Keenan (1971: 45) describes in the following way:",19
441,"A sentence S logically presupposes a sentence S' just S logically implies S' and the negation of S,–S, also logically implies S'.",19
442,"If we take the first sentence of extract (I) as S, and present it below as (2a), we can also present the negation of S, as (2b), and the logical presupposition, S', as (2c).",19
443,(2),19
444,a.,19
445,My uncle is coming home from Canada.,19
446,b.,19
447,My uncle isn't coming home from Canada.,19
448,c.,19
449,I have an uncle.,19
450,"Following Keenan's definition, we can say that (2a) logically presupposes (2c) constancy under negation.",19
451,"However, it seems rather unnecessary to introduce the negative sentence (2b) into a consideration of the relationship between (2a) and (2c) which arises in the conversation presented earlier in (I).",19
452,"Though it may not be common knowledge that the speaker has an uncle, it is what Grice (1981: 190) terms ‘noncontroversial’ information.",19
453,"Moreover, since the speaker chose to say we must assume she didn't feel the need to assert the information.",19
454,What she appears to be asserting is that this person is ,19
455,"Given this assertion, the idea that we should consider the of this  assertion to find out whether there is a presupposition in what the speaker has not asserted seems particularly counterintuitive.",19
456,The introduction of the negative sentence (2b) into a consideration of (2a) creates an additional problem.,19
457,", it has been suggested (cf.",19
458,"Kempson, 1975) that a sentence (2d) is a perfectly reasonable sentence of English and undermines the argument for logical presupposition, as it is defined above",19
459,(2d) My uncle isn't coming home from Canada because I don't have an uncle.,19
460,Sentences like (2d) always seem typical of utterances made by a speaker to deny another speaker's presupposition in a rather aggressive way.,19
461,Yet the circumstances in which (2d) might be uttered are likely to be quite different from those in which the first sentence of extract (I) was uttered.,19
462,"we may suggest, would have different presuppositions, in the two situations.",19
463,"If we rely on a notion of speaker, or pragmatic, presupposition, we can simply treat (2c) as a presupposition of the speaker in uttering (2a).",19
464,Sentences (2b) and (2d) do not come into consideration .,19
465,"a view that hearers behave speakers' presuppositions are to be accepted, there is the rather disturbing evidence from Loftus' study (1975) of answers to leading questions.",19
466,After watching a film of a car accident some subjects were asked the two questions in (3).,19
467,(3),19
468,a.,19
469,How fast was car A going when it turned right?,19
470,b.,19
471,Did you see a stop sign?,19
472,We can note that one of the speaker-presuppositions in asking (3a) is that ,19
473,A number (35%) answered yes to question (3b).,19
474,Another group of subjects were asked the questions in (4).,19
475,(4),19
476,a.,19
477,How fast was car A going when it ran the stop sign?,19
478,b.,19
479,Did you see a stop sign?,19
480,One of the speaker-presuppositions in asking (4a) is that .,19
481,"In this situation, a significantly larger group (53%) answered yes to question (4b).",19
482,"It is worth noting that a number of subjects did not answer the b question truth or falsehood of fact, but what the speaker, in asking the preceding question, had appeared to presuppose.",19
483,"(For a more detailed discussion of this issue, see Loftus, 1975 and Loftus & Zanni, 1975.)",19
484,"We shall reconsider the notion of presupposition in section 3.3.2, but generally avoid the complex arguments which revolve around the presuppositions of sentences and propositions.",19
485,(See the contributions and bibliography in Oh & Dineen (eds.) 1979.),19
486,Implicatures,19
487,"The term ‘implicature’ is used by Grice (1975) to account for what a speaker can imply, suggest, or mean, as distinct from what the speaker literally says.",19
488,"There are which are, Grice, determined by ‘the conventional meaning of the words used’(1975: 44).",19
489,"In the following example (5), the speaker does not directly assert that one property (being brave) follows from another property (being an Englishman), but the form of expression used conventionally implicates that such a relation does hold.",19
490,"(5) He is an Englishman, he is, therefore, brave.",19
491,"If it should turn out that the individual in question is an Englishman, and not brave, then the implicature is mistaken, but the utterance, Grice suggests, need not be false.",19
492,"For a fuller discussion of conventional implicature, see Karttunen & Peters (1979).",19
493,Of much greater interest to the discourse analyst is the notion of which is derived from a general principle of conversation plus a number of maxims which speakers will normally obey.,19
494,The general principle is called the which Grice (1975: 45) presents in the following terms:,19
495,"Make your conversational contribution is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged.",19
496,"The conversational conventions, or maxims, which support this principle are as follows:",19
497,Quantity: Make your contribution as informative as is required (for the current purposes of the exchange).,19
498,Do not make your contribution more informative than is required.,19
499,Quality: Do not say what you believe to be false.,19
500,Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.,19
501,Relation: Be relevant.,19
502,Manner: Be perspicuous.,19
503,Avoid obscurity of expression.,19
504,Avoid ambiguity.,19
505,Be brief (avoid unnecessary prolixity).,19
506,Be orderly.,19
507,Grice does not suggest that this is an exhaustive list — he notes that a maxim also normally observed — nor that equal weight should be attached to each of the stated maxims.,19
508,"(The maxim of manner, , does not obviously apply to primarily interactional conversation.)",19
509,We might observe that the instruction seems to cover all the other instructions.,19
510,"However, by providing a description of the norms speakers operate with in conversation, Grice makes it possible to describe what types of meaning a speaker can convey by ‘flouting’ one of these maxims.",19
511,"This flouting of a maxim results in the speaker conveying, the literal meaning of his utterance, an additional meaning, which is a conversational implicature.",19
512,"As a brief example, we can consider the following exchange:",19
513,(6),19
514,A: I am petrol.,19
515,B: There is a garage round the corner.,19
516,"In this exchange, Grice (1975: 51) suggests that B would be infringing the instruction if he was gratuitously stating a fact about the world via the literal meaning of his utterance.",19
517,"The implicature, derived from the assumption that speaker B is adhering to the Cooperative Principle, is that the garage is not only round the corner, but also will be open and selling petrol.",19
518,"We might also note that, to arrive at the implicature, we have to know certain.facts about the world, that garages sell petrol, and that not a great distance away.",19
519,"We also have to  interpret A's remark not only as a description of a particular state of affairs, but as a request for help, .",19
520,"Once the analysis of intended meaning goes beyond the literal meaning of the ‘sentences-on-the-page’, a vast number of related issues have to be considered.",19
521,"We shall investigate some of these issues in the course of this book, particularly in Chapters 6 and 7.",19
522,"As a brief account of how the term ‘implicature’ is used in discourse analysis, we have summarised the important points in Grice's proposal.",19
523,We would like to emphasise the fact that implicatures are pragmatic aspects of meaning and have certain identifiable characteristics.,19
524,"They are partially derived from the conventional or literal meaning of an utterance, produced in a specific context which is shared by the speaker and the hearer, and depend on a recognition by the speaker and the hearer of the Cooperative Principle and its maxims.",19
525,"For the analyst, the hearer, conversational implicatures must be treated as inherently indeterminate since they derive from a supposition that the speaker has the intention of conveying meaning and of obeying the Cooperative Principle.",19
526,"Since the analyst has only limited access to what a speaker intended, or how sincerely he was behaving, in the production of a discourse fragment, any claims regarding the implicatures identified will have the status of interpretations.",19
527,"In this respect, the discourse analyst is not in the apparently secure position of the formal linguist who has ‘rules’ of the language which are or are not satisfied, but rather, is in the position of the hearer who has interpretations of the discourse which do, or do not, make sense.",19
528,"(For a more detailed treatment of conversational implicature, see Levinson, forthcoming.)",19
529,Inference,19
530,"Since the discourse analyst, like the hearer, has no direct access to a speaker's intended meaning in producing an utterance, he often has to rely on a process of inference to arrive at an interpretation for utterances or for the connections between utterances.",19
531,Such inferences appear to be of different kinds.,19
532,"It may be the case that we are capable of deriving a specific conclusion (7c) from specific premises (7a) and (7b), via deductive inference, but we are rarely asked to do so in the everyday discourse we encounter.",19
533,(7),19
534,a.,19
535,"If it's sunny, it's warm.",19
536,b.,19
537,It's sunny.,19
538,c.,19
539,"So, it's warm.",19
540,We are more likely to operate with a rather loose form of inferencing which leads us to believe that mentioned in (8) belong to visitors to the house which has in its kitchen.,19
541,(8) in the kitchen there was a huge dresser and when anyone went in you see + the hats and coats were all dumped on this dresser,19
542,"It may be, , that such an inference is wrong, but, as discourse processors, we seem to prefer to make inferences which have some likelihood of being justified and, if some subsequent information does not fit in with this inference, we abandon it and form another.",19
543,"As an illustration of this, consider the following example (9), taken from Sanford & Garrod (1981: 10):",19
544,(9) John was on his way to school.,19
545,"If we were to take a formal view of the entailments of such a declarative sentence (like that, , expressed in Smith & Wilson, 1979: 150f.), we would be obliged to accept as entailments a set of sentences which would include the following:",19
546,(10),19
547,a.,19
548,Someone was on his way to school.,19
549,b.,19
550,John was on his way to somewhere.,19
551,c.,19
552,Someone was on his way to somewhere.,19
553,This view of what we infer from reading (9) will only provide us with a limited insight into how readers interpret what they read.,19
554,"Most readers report that they infer from (9) that John is a schoolboy, among other things.",19
555,"When sentence (9) is followed later in the same text by sentence (II), readers readily abandon their original inference and form another, that John is a schoolteacher.",19
556,(11) Last week he had been unable to control the class.,19
557,"to capture this type of inference, which is extremely common in our interpretation of discourse, we need a relatively  loose notion of inference based on socio-cultural knowledge.",19
558,"Gumperz (1977) presents an extended discussion of the types of factors involved in this type of pragmatic, logical, inference.",19
559,We shall discuss the influence of inference in more detail in Chapter 7.,19
560,"For the moment, we simply present a view which claims that the terms and must be treated as pragmatic concepts in the analysis of discourse.",19
561,These terms will be used to indicate relationships between discourse participants and elements in the discourse.,19
562,"Since the pragmatic use of these terms is closely tied to the context in which a discourse occurs, we shall now investigate what aspects of context have to be considered in undertaking the analysis of discourse.",19
563,The context of situation,19
564,"Since the beginning of the 1970s, linguists have become increasingly aware of the importance of context in the interpretation of sentences.",19
565,The implications of taking context into account are well expressed by Sadock (1978: 281):,19
566,"There is, then, a serious methodological problem that confronts the advocate of linguistic pragmatics.",19
567,"Given some aspects of what a sentence conveys in a particular context, is that aspect part of what the sentence conveys in virtue of its meaning…or should it be ‘worked out’ on the basis of Gricean principles from the rest of the meaning of the sentence and relevant facts of the context of utterance?",19
568,If we are to begin to consider the second part of this question seriously we need to be able to specify what are the ‘relevant facts of the context of utterance’.,19
569,The same problem is raised by Fillmore (1977: 119) when he advocates a methodology to which a discourse analyst may often wish to appeal:,19
570,The task is to determine what we can know about the meaning and context of an utterance given only the knowledge that the utterance has occurred…,19
571,"I find that whenever I notice some sentence in context, I immediately find myself asking what the effect would have been if the context had been slightly different.",19
572,"to make appeal to this methodology, which is very commonly used in linguistic and philosophical discussion, we need to know what it would mean for the context to be ‘slightly different’.",19
573,Features of context,19
574,Consider two invented scenarios in which an identical utterance is produced by two distinct speakers.,19
575,a,19
576,": a young mother,: her mother-in-law,: park, by a duckpond,: sunny afternoon in September 1962.",19
577,"They are watching the young mother's two-year-old son chasing ducks and the mother-in-law has just remarked that her son, the child's father, was rather at this age.",19
578,The young mother says:,19
579,I do think quick,19
580,b,19
581,": a student,a set of students,: sitting round a coffee table in the refectory,evening in March 1980.",19
582,"John, one of the group, has just told a joke.",19
583,Everyone laughs except Adam.,19
584,Then Adam laughs.,19
585,One of the students says:,19
586,I do think quick,19
587,(In each case phonological prominence is placed on .),19
588,"Clearly we can do a formal analysis on these tokens and, in both cases, the speaker says of Adam that he is quick.",19
589,"It is clear, however, that the utterances in the contexts of situation in which they are cited, would be taken to convey very different messages.",19
590,In (a) we shall simplistically assume that the referents of I and are fixed by spatio-temporal co-ordinates.,19
591,"This ‘Adam’ is being compared (or contrasted), favourably, with his father.",19
592,"may be interpreted, in the context of as meaning something like ‘quick in developing’.",19
593,In (b) different referents for I and are fixed spatiotemporally.,19
594,"This ‘Adam’ is being compared (or contrasted) not with his father and favourably, but with the set of other students unfavourably.",19
595,In this case must be interpreted as meaning something like ‘quick to understand /react /see the joke’.,19
596,"Moreover, since it is said in a context where Adam has just manifestly failed to react to the punch-line as quickly as the set of other students, the speaker (given this type of speaker to this type of hearer in this type of surroundings) will be assumed not to be intending to tell an untruth, but to be implicating the opposite of what she has said.",19
597,Is it possible to determine in any principled way what aspects of context of situation are relevant to these different interpretations of the same ‘utterance’ on two occasions?,19
598,J. R. Firth (regarded by many as the founder of modern British linguistics) remarked:,19
599,"Logicians are apt to think of words and propositions as having ‘meaning’ somehow in themselves, participants in contexts of situation.",19
600,Speakers and listeners do not seem to be necessary.,19
601,"I suggest that voices should not be entirely dissociated from the social context in which they function and that therefore all texts in modern spoken languages should be regarded as having ‘the implication of utterance’, and be referred to typical participants in some generalised context of situation.",19
602,(1957: 226),19
603,"Firth, then, was concerned to embed the utterance in the ‘social context’ and to generalise across meanings in specified social contexts.",19
604,He proposed an approach to the principled description of such contexts which bears a close resemblance to more recent descriptions which we shall go on to examine:,19
605,"My view was, and still is, that ‘context of situation’ is best used as a suitable schematic construct to apply to language events…",19
606,A context of situation for linguistic work brings into relation the following categories:,19
607,A,19
608,"The relevant features of participants: persons, personalities.",19
609,i,19
610,The verbal action of the participants.,19
611,ii,19
612,The non-verbal action of the participants.,19
613,B,19
614,The relevant objects.,19
615,C,19
616,The effect of the verbal action.,19
617,…,19
618,A very rough parallel to this sort of context can be found in language manuals providing the learner with a picture of the railway station and the operative words for travelling by train.,19
619,It is very rough.,19
620,"But it is parallel with the grammatical rules, and is based on the repetitive routines of initiated persons in the society under description.",19
621,"(1957: 182; for a practical application of Firth's approach, see Mitchell, 1957.)",19
622,An approach similarly emphasising the importance of an ethnographic view of communicative events within communities has been developed by Hymes in a series of articles.,19
623,"Hymes views the role of context in interpretation as, on the one hand, limiting the range of possible interpretations and, on the other, as supporting the intended interpretation:",19
624,The use of a linguistic form identifies a range of meanings.,19
625,A context can support a range of meanings.,19
626,When a form is used in a context it  eliminates the meanings possible to that context those the form can signal: the context eliminates from consideration the meanings possible to the form those the context can support.,19
627,"(Hymes, 1962, quoted in Wootton, 1975: 44)",19
628,Hymes (1964) sets about specifying the features of context which may be relevant to the identification of a type of speech event in a way reminiscent of Firth's.,19
629,"Like Firth, he seizes first on the ‘persons’ participating in the speech event.",19
630,"Generalising over speech events, he abstracts the roles ",19
631,The addressor is the speaker or writer who produces the utterance.,19
632,The addressee is the hearer or reader who is the recipient of the utterance.,19
633,(Later Hymes also distinguishes since the presence of overhearers may contribute to the specification of the speech event.),19
634,Knowledge of the addressor in a given communicative event makes it possible for the analyst to imagine what that particular person is likely to say.,19
635,Knowledge of his addressee constrains the analyst's expectations even further.,19
636,"Thus, if you know the speaker is the prime minister or the departmental secretary or your family doctor or your mother, and you know that the speaker is speaking to a colleague or his bank manager or a small child, you will have different expectations of the sort of language which will be produced, both form and to content.",19
637,"If you know, further, what is being talked about, Hymes' category of your expectations will be further constrained.",19
638,"If then you have information about the both where the event is situated in place and time, and the physical relations of the interactants posture and gesture and facial expression, your expectations will be still further limited.",19
639,"The remaining features of context which Hymes discusses (in 1964) include large-scale features like (how is contact between the participants in the event being maintained — by speech, writing, signing, smoke signals),(what language, or dialect, or style of language is being used),(what form is intended — chat, debate, sermon, fairy-tale, sonnet, love-letter, etc.) and (the nature of the communicative event within which a genre may be embedded — thus a sermon or prayer may be part of the larger event, a church service).",19
640,"In later recensions Hymes adds other features, key (which involves evaluation — was it a good sermon, a pathetic explanation, etc.), and  (what did the participants intend should come about as a result of the communicative event).",19
641,Hymes intends that these contextual features should be regarded rather as general phonetic features are regarded.,19
642,"Just as a phonetician may select, from the general phonetic features available, the features and but not to characterise a [b], so, he suggests, the analyst may choose from the contextual features, those necessary to characterise a particular communicative event.",19
643,"Just as the phonetician may wish to make a more detailed, more specific description of the [b]under consideration, mentioning delayed onset of voicing and some protrusion of the lips during the period of closure, so may the ethnographer wish to specify some of the contextual features in great detail.",19
644,We shall return to this point.,19
645,Hymes' features constitute essentially a checklist which would enable a visiting ethnographer to arrive by helicopter in a location where a communicative event is in process and to check off the detail of the nature of the communicative event.,19
646,Let us consider such an ethnographer as an invisible witness to a particular speech event.,19
647,"He would begin, presumably, by noting the larger-scale features of context: what is being used (we shall say what language being used (we shall specify it is what being performed (we shall specify it is what it embedded in (we shall specify it is part of an ",19
648,He can identify the participants: the a young scientist who is being interviewed by the who is doing research on language.,19
649,The setting is physically located in the addressee's territory in Edinburgh University and a prominent physical feature is a tape-recorder which is switched on.,19
650,"The time is during the later 1970s (so it is reasonable to expect that they will speak modern English, with Scottish accents).",19
651,"It has just been agreed that they will talk about the young scientist's work, the tape-recorder is switched on and he says:",19
652,(12) I must admit I'm very nervous.,19
653,"His at this point, we shall simplistically assume (see further discussion in Chapter 3), is his nervousness.",19
654,"Given the knowledge of context the analyst has, he should find  this a fairly unsurprising utterance.",19
655,"It is very rarely the case in real life that we can predict in detail the form and content of the language which we will encounter, but, given all of the ethnographic information we have specified, the actual occurring utterance is much more likely (hence, we assume, much more readily processed by the addressee) than any of the following ‘utterances’ which did not occur:",19
656,(13),19
657,a.,19
658,Please pass the marmalade.,19
659,b.,19
660,My cat has just been sick again.,19
661,c.,19
662,Get into the box.,19
663,d.,19
664,I am about to make the first incision.,19
665,"The more the analyst knows about the features of context, the more likely he is to be able to predict what is likely to be said (see 2.4).",19
666,It is further the case that the ethnographic features will give us a value for the deictic forms occurring in the utterance which was actually produced.,19
667,"Thus 1,and must be interpreted the speaker, the young scientist, at the time of making the utterance.",19
668,"(The context here makes the other possible reading, that the speaker is characteristically nervous all of the time, so unlikely as not to be considered apparently by the addressee, or indeed by the analyst until the process of analysis was brought to conscious attention.)",19
669,In 2.,19
670,I we pointed out that deictic elements of the utterances can only be interpreted the context in which they are uttered.,19
671,Hymes' checklist of ethnographic features offers one characterisation of context to which we can relate such deictic elements.,19
672,"A more elaborate checklist is provided by the philosopher Lewis (1972), specifically to provide an index of those co-ordinates which a hearer would need to have specified that he could determine the truth of a sentence.",19
673,"Like most formal linguists, Lewis assumes that the speech, the English, the conversation and the one where one individual is informing another.",19
674,"His interests lie, not with these general features of the communicative event, but with those particular co-ordinates which constitute ‘a package of relevant factors, an index’(1972: 173) and which characterise the context against which the truth of a sentence is to be judged.",19
675,The co-ordinates of the index are specified as follows:,19
676,a,19
677,"co-ordinate: this is to account for states of affairs which might , or or ",19
678,b,19
679,co-ordinate: to account for tensed sentences and adverbials like or ,19
680,c,19
681,co-ordinate: to account for sentences like ,19
682,d,19
683,"co-ordinate: to account for sentences which include first person reference (I,etc.)",19
684,e,19
685,"co-ordinate: to account for sentences including you,etc.",19
686,f,19
687,co-ordinate: to account for sentences containing demonstrative phrases like etc.,19
688,g,19
689,co-ordinate: to account for sentences including phrases like etc.,19
690,h,19
691,"co-ordinate: an infinite series of things (sets of things, sequences of things…)",19
692,Rather similar lists are proposed by scholars who are concerned with the construction of formal discourse domains (see discussion in Chapter 3).,19
693,"For our present purposes we should note that Lewis' list, like Hymes', makes reference to the and to assign values to the deictic categories of speaker and audience (addressor /addressee) realised in first and second person pronouns.",19
694,Hymes' category expanded to take explicit and distinct account of and ,19
695,Hymes' generalised feature of now distributed between the deictic co-ordinate the co-ordinate and the co-ordinate.,19
696,This last co-ordinate specifically enables the hearer to interpret what is said what has already been said.,19
697,"It builds in a cumulative temporal structure to the index, the hearer must continually update the information in his component, to take account of what has most recently been added.",19
698,"It is, obviously, not possible for us in a textbook to permit you to  have the experience of everyday discourse in what Stenning (1978) calls a ‘normal context’, where the hearer is part of the context and then experiences the text.",19
699,"We have to have recourse to what Stenning calls ‘abnormal’ contexts, where the analyst reads the text and then has to try to provide the characteristics of the context in which the text might have occurred.",19
700,"We are going to provide you with three written fragments, abstracted from the contexts in which they appeared.",19
701,"The first two are printed, the third spraygunned on a wall.",19
702,"We ask you to consider what, if any, difficulty you have in understanding them, the co-ordinates of Lewis' index.",19

710,"We have not, , introduced any satisfactory way of handling your experience of previous similar texts (see discussion in 2.4).",19
711,For the moment we shall suppose that you probably recognise the type of writer in (a) as some impersonal /institutionalised writer addressing a general reader a particular individual (paying attention to and and the ellipsis in the second sentence nearest (to the),19
712,If you have difficulty in interpreting this fragment it is probably partly because you are not sure of the referents of the expression and ,19
713,"may work out that the two holes have to be of a suitable size for an individual (?) to put two fingers in, possibly near enough to to put two fingers of the same hand in, and, having established this scale, it seems likely that the object referred to as only centimetres removed, kilometres removed.",19
714,It would certainly help you to have the following information:,19
715,The the Post Office.,19
716,The as a telephone user.,19
717,You can probably work out the rest if you did not know it already.,19
718,However we shall spell out some more:,19
719,"The of utterance in clock or calendar time does not seem relevant, but what certainly is relevant is that you should know whether this instruction still applies.",19
720,(It does.),19
721,The of the original utterance is hardly relevant but where you would encounter the text is.,19
722,(Look in your telephone directory.),19
723,The that is relevant is specified in the ‘It is worth remembering how to dial 999 in darkness or smoke.’,19
724,"(We should point out that you are not here being asked to use the co-ordinates for the purpose Lewis intended them for, to determine the truth of a sentence.",19
725,It is a matter of debate whether truth can be assigned to sentences in the imperative form.),19
726,In text the problem of interpretation arises not knowing the referents for the expressions and and not having a value to fix the time expression ,19
727,"may be able to work out that refers to an animate masculine entity, the subject of both clauses.",19
728,"You may wonder why it is reported that which may suggest that he was unable to express his own resentment, which may limit your range of potential interpretations of the expression ",19
729,"note that he where plural, and you may consider what plural entity may be both and (or not worn).",19
730,"This example has all the characteristics of a sentence occurring within a larger piece of text, and illustrates quite clearly the need for a ‘previous discourse’ co-ordinate, the more obvious ‘time’and ‘place’co-ordinates.",19
731,This text appeared in on 4 June 1980.,19
732,"In the preceding part of the text, the writer has been describing a particular racehorse which had been fitted with blinkers for its previous race ().",19
733,"The third text,, offers more thorny problems.",19
734,"Whereas the language of and quite straightforward and all you require to arrive at an interpretation are values for expressions being used to refer, you may feel that the language here is obscure, perhaps not even meaningful.",19
735,It is relevant that the time at which this text appeared was in the late 1970s.,19
736,Your experience of previous similar  texts in the 1970s may have familiarised you with the form X which may permit you to divide this unpunctuated sequence into two parts:,19
737,SQUASHED INSECTS DONT BITE MAD MENTAL RULE,19
738,The place at which it appeared is relevant.,19
739,It was spraygunned on a wall in Glasgow.,19
740,"The form of the text, together with the information about place, may suggest to you, if you have previous experience of such texts, that this text derives from an interaction between street gangs.",19
741, knowledge of the world might inform you that the writer is a member of ‘Mad Mental’(a street gang) and that the intended addressees are members of ‘The Insects’(another street gang).,19
742,You then need to make appeal to previous discourse in which the Insects had proclaimed INSECTS BITE.,19
743,(You might then appeal to your knowledge of what Hymes calls ‘message-form’ which informs you that street gang interactions on walls consists of taunts and counter-taunts.,19
744,"Thus you might arrive at an attribution of intention in the warning SQUASHED INSECTS DONT BITE and the straight assertion MAD MENTAL RULE — without the tag, which might be taken to invite assent the addressee.)",19
745,"Texts and b, addressed to the general reader, are relatively accessible fragments of language which require only specification of the intended referents to make them readily interpretable.",19
746,"Text c is intended for specific addressees, not for the general public, and it is hard for the general public to interpret without access to shared presuppositions and previous experience which cannot comfortably be forced into the framework proposed by Lewis.",19
747,"to take account of this, we are going to need some way of making appeals to notions like ‘shared presuppositions’, knowledge', ‘intention /purpose in uttering’ and ‘experience of previous similar text’which we have simply appealed to in an way in our discussion so far.",19
748,We return to these questions in 2.3.,19
749,"What we have shown in this section is that the contextual features suggested by Hymes, supplemented with the index of co-ordinates proposed by Lewis (put forward, remember, with quite different purposes in mind) do enable us to give a partial account of what the undifferentiated term ‘context’ may mean.",19
750,From this it follows that  we could give some account of what it might mean to ‘change the context’ in the sense in which Fillmore (1977: 119) envisages this when he says ‘I…find myself asking what the effect would have been if the context had been slightly different.’,19
751,"We could reply that if you alter the condition specified by any of the co-ordinates, you alter the context.",19
752,"At this point we shall consider only the alteration of one co-ordinate, the speaker co-ordinate.",19
753,"Obviously, if Jane says I'm and Mary says I'm we observe that on one occasion it is Jane who announces that she is skipping and on another it is Mary.",19
754,In each case the sentence is true if the person who spoke was skipping at the time of the utterance.,19
755,"However, if we are further told that speaker Jane is only three years old, we may, paying attention to the announcement, consider that it is a remarkable feat for a three-year-old.",19
756,"Whereas if Mary is eight years old and known to be an intrepid skipper, the announcement may be one of a depressingly predictable series.",19
757,"We pay different amounts of attention to the announcements and react to them differently, because one aspect of the context, the speaker, is significantly different.",19
758,Consider the following fragment of conversation:,19
759,(15),19
760,A: are you often here,19
761,B: quite often + about once a month + actually ++ I come up to see my children,19
762,You have to suppose of B that B is of an age to have children.,19
763,"What we are interested in is the different sorts of inferences which we make as addressees, variables like the age and sex of the speaker, as a result of hearing what B says.",19
764,Suppose B is a man of seventy.,19
765,We assume that B's children will be grown-up.,19
766,"Nothing particular follows from the fact that he visits them once a month, except perhaps we infer that he has a close relationship with them.",19
767,Suppose the speaker is a young man in his thirties.,19
768,"We assume that children he has will be young children, children of an age who usually live with their parents.",19
769,"We may then wonder why B's children are not living with their father, wonder whether the exigences of his professional life, or of his relationship with the children's mother, constrains him to live them.",19
770,Suppose the speaker is a young woman in her thirties.,19
771,"Again we assume that  she would young children, children who would normally be expected to be living with her.",19
772,"Since, in the case of the parents being separated, young children usually live with their mother in our society, we might infer that the woman's children are in some form of institutional or educational care.",19
773,"(In the conversation we quote from, the speaker was a man in his early thirties and the children were living with his estranged wife, all inferences which had been drawn by A before B went on to explain that this was the case.)",19
774,Observe that the sorts of inferences we have been discussing are not sanctioned by the form of language used.,19
775,"The different inferences arise the alteration of the context, in the simple manipulation of age and sex of the addressor.",19
776,It is the interpretation of the utterance in context which permits the hearer to draw such inferences (see Chapter 7 for further discussion of inferences).,19
777,Co-text,19
778,In our discussion so far we have concentrated particularly on the physical context in which single utterances are embedded and we have paid rather little attention to the co-ordinate.,19
779,Lewis introduced this co-ordinate to take account of sentences which include specific reference to what has been mentioned before as in phrases like ,19
780,"It is, however, the case that any sentence the first in a fragment of discourse, will have the whole of its interpretation forcibly constrained by the preceding text, not just those phrases which obviously and specifically refer to the preceding text, like ",19
781,"Just as the interpretation of the token α in the child's representation of ‘without to disturb the lion’ and the token [p]in [greipbritn]are determined by the context in which they appear, so the words which occur in discourse are constrained by what, following Halliday, we shall call their ",19
782,Consider the following lexical items in a number of verbal contexts cited almost from :,19
783,(16),19
784,a.,19
785,"The children of the Indians are saved, to be sold or given as servants, or rather slaves for as long a time as the  owners can make them believe themselves slaves.",19
786,But I believe in their there is little to complain of (114),19
787,b.,19
788,The same evening I went on shore.,19
789,The first in any new country is very interesting.,19
790,(169),19
791,c.,19
792,"When we came within hail, one of the four natives who were present advanced to receive us and began to shout most vehemently, wishing to direct us where to land.",19
793,When we were on shore the looked rather alarmed.,19
794,(206),19
795,d.,19
796,"After crossing many low hills, we descended into the small land-locked plain of Guitron.",19
797,"In the this one, which are elevated from one thousand to two thousand feet above the sea, two species of acacia…grow in large numbers.",19
798,(257)(1892 edition),19
799,The point we wish to make here should be an obvious one and can be made many of the other items which we have not italicised in the cited texts.,19
800,"However, consider the sort of lexical content you would expect to find associated with the forms and in a dictionary entry, and note how finding the forms embedded within a co-text constrains their interpretation.",19
801,"Just as the interpretation of individual lexical items is constrained by co-text, so is the interpretation of utterances within a discourse.",19
802,Consider this text of the beginning of a sixteen-year-old Scottish pupil's account of a Sempé cartoon:,19
803,(17),19
804,a. a man and woman sitting in the living room + the woman sitting reading quite happily — the man's bored goes to the window looks out the window + and gets himself ready and goes out +,19
805,"The reader must interpret as the ‘woman’ already mentioned, hence must construct an interpretation which has her ‘sitting reading quite happily ",19
806,Similarly the which the man approaches must be interpreted as ‘the window of the living room’.,19
807,The speaker continues with a change of location and we have to assume that what follows is within the newly introduced location:,19
808,b. goes to his goes to a club + has a drink talks to the barman + then he starts dancing with a beautiful girl long black hair + has a good time +,19
809,We interpret everything that happens here as happening to the man we met in the living room who is now at ,19
810,he and all at the ‘club’.,19
811,The speaker announces another change of location,19
812,c. then he goes home and he calls her + and his wife overhears him +,19
813,"Again we assume that we are still talking about the same man, that he has returned to the location where the ‘living room’ we first met was located.",19
814,Now the analyst may be in some doubt how to interpret since the man might reasonably go into the house and call (shout for) his wife.,19
815,However this interpretation is ruled out by the following co-text ,19
816,we are obliged to interpret as meaning ‘phones’ and as referring to ‘the beautiful girl with long black hair with whom he danced and had a good time’.,19
817,"Within the co-text, as we have seen in (17) above, a further context may be constructed which has its own index of coordinates.",19
818,"Indeed within that constructed context, further contexts may be nested.",19
819,Consider the following passages:,19
820,"(18) About four months before the time I am writing of, my Lady had been in London, and had gone over a Reformatory…",19
821,"The matron, seeing my Lady took an interest in the place, pointed out a girl to her, named Rosanna Spearman, and told her a most miserable story: which I haven't the heart to repeat here; for I don't like to be made wretched without any use, and no more do you.",19
822,"The upshot of it was, that Rosanna Spearman had been a thief…",19
823,"(Wilkie Collins,)",19
824,"The actual place and time of writing of the manuscript by the author, Wilkie Collins, or indeed the identity of the author, is not a necessary piece of information for the reader to interpret the text.",19
825,"We may assume, however, that he will have a better understanding of the purpose of the author in constructing the text in the way it is constructed if he knows that it is written in the late nineteenth century (which will account for some differences in in Hymes' terms) in Victorian England (which will account for the reference to a and that the author is constructing the first English detective story, narrating the events from the point of view  of four different participants, whose characters are revealed by the narrative style which the author assigns to them.",19
826,"We have then, an author and an actual time and place writing the novel (or a series times and places).",19
827,Then to each narrator is assigned a time and place the writing his contribution.,19
828,It is presumably that time which is relevant to the comment where I the current narrator.,19
829,"Immediately preceding this extracted fragment, the narrator has been describing an incident relevant to the main story.",19
830,This is referred to in the expression ,19
831,"The narrator then proceeds to give some background information, which he situates in a previous ",19
832,"He introduces who, at the time four months before was a resident of the but at some previous time to that,",19
833,Within the time domain of ‘four months before’ a new speaker and hearer are introduced:,19
834,"(19) My Lady…said to the matron upon that, ‘Rosanna Spearman shall have her chance, in my service’.",19
835,"In a week afterwards, Rosanna Spearman entered this establishment as our second housemaid.",19
836,"At the time of utterance, four , the beneficent lady speaks of the future,",19
837,"In the following sentence the narrator comments on what happened a week later than the time of the lady's speech, from the point of view of his context at the time of writing his contribution to the novel,…",19
838,This brief introduction does scant justice to the interest of the temporal structure of this passage.,19
839,"It does, however, indicate the complexity of nested contexts established by co-text which, as hearers /readers, we are capable of interpreting.",19
840,In Chapter 6 we shall discuss the issue of anaphoric reference which is generally held to depend crucially on co-text for interpretation.,19
841,For the moment the main point we are concerned to make is to stress the power of co-text in constraining interpretation.,19
842,"Even in the absence of information about place and time of original utterance, even in the absence of information about the speaker /writer and his intended recipient, it is often possible to reconstruct  some part of the physical context and to arrive at some interpretation of the text.",19
843,"The more co-text there is, , the more secure the interpretation is.",19
844,Text creates its own context.,19
845,"As Isard (1975: 377) remarks: ‘communications do not merely depend on the context for their interpretation, they change that context’.",19
846,The expanding context,19
847,"In our discussion so far, we have been concerned to impose some sort of analytic structure on the lumpen mass of context.",19
848,"We have abstracted particular contexts, across communicative contexts , to arrive at a set of features, some of which seem relevant to the identification of a speech event as being of a particular kind, to the ability of the hearer to predict what sort of thing the speaker is likely to say in a given type of context, and to the constraining of interpretation in context.",19
849,The observant reader will have noticed that we have helped ourselves to the content of the features proposed by Hymes and the co-ordinates proposed by Lewis in a fairly arbitrary way.,19
850,So we have given variable amounts of information about the or the or the or the as we have discussed different fragments of discourse.,19
851,This behaviour is consistent with Hymes' own expectations about how his framework would be used.,19
852,"You will remember that he thought that contextual features might be considered in the way that general phonetic features are considered: sometimes, but not always relevant, and specifiable to variable degrees of delicacy for different purposes (2.2.",19
853,I).,19
854,"A problem for the discourse analyst must be, then, to decide when a particular feature is relevant to the specification of a particular context and what degree of specification is required.",19
855,"Are there general principles which will determine the relevance or nature of the specification, or does the analyst have to make judgements on these questions each time he attempts to work on a fragment of discourse?",19
856,"For the moment, we shall limit our discussion of this question to those features which relate directly to the those features which will permit interpretation for deictic expressions like the temporal expression the spatial expression and the first person expression I. Are there standard procedures for determining what information is relevant to the interpretation of these expressions?",19
857,"Lyons (1977: 570) suggests that there might, in principle, be such standard procedures:",19
858,"Every actual utterance is spatiotemporally unique, being spoken or written at a particular place and at a particular time; and there is some standard system for identifying points in space and time, we can, in principle, specify the actual spatiotemporal situation of any utterance act.",19
859,There clearly are standard systems for locating points in time and space.,19
860,"It would be possible to specify the time of an utterance as stretching between say a.m. and a.m. on 5 June 1961, specifying the utterance clock and calendar time, good standard systems.",19
861,"We could, then, presumably, if we had the relevant instrumentation, specify the place of the utterance a fine interaction of latitude and longitude.",19
862,"It is not clear, however, that these particular standard systems produce the relevant information on all occasions.",19
863,"Presumably some patrol ship on the high seas might log messages in this way, but it is clear that, as humans, our experience of utterances is not that we have recorded in memory a list of utterances to which are attached standard tags specifying time and place in these terms.",19
864,A friend can attempt to recall to your mind some utterance which you both experienced by a variety of place and time tags:,19
865,(20),19
866,a.,19
867,But you just said he wasn't.,19
868,(Place: maintained; time: only minutes ago),19
869,b.,19
870,You said in the staff meeting yesterday that he wasn't.,19
871,c.,19
872,You said last week at the staff meeting that he wasn't.,19
873,d.,19
874,You said last year when we met in Toronto that he wasn't.,19
875,"The further away in time the message was situated, the less likely the speaker is to remember precisely the date and time at which it occurred, and the larger the time-span he is likely to make available for it to have occurred in.",19
876,"It seems unlikely then, that ‘standard procedures’ of recording space and time are going to be relevant to the unique identification of utterance acts.",19
877,Perhaps the standard procedures will enable us to fix the relevant space spans for the interpretation of deictic expressions like .,19
878,"Suppose X is talking to Y, standing on the blue border of the carpet in X's office, in a given street, in Manchester, in England, in ",19
879,"Britain, in Western Europe…",19
880,Y might produce any of the following utterances:,19
881,(21),19
882,a.,19
883,There's another worn section which needs repair here.,19
884,b.,19
885,You've got a very nice room here.,19
886,c.,19
887,It's a really nasty day here.,19
888,d.,19
889,You have a comparatively mild climate here.,19
890,"It must be clear that the spatial location identified by in each of these expressions could be interpreted as a series of concentric rings spreading out from the speaker and encompassing different amounts of physical space, but the interpretation of the spatial range of the expression on any particular occasion of use will have to be sought in the context of what the speaker is talking about.",19
891,"What appears to be stable in interpretations of (curious usages deriving from long-distance telephonic communication and long-distance travel, discussed in Lyons, 1977) is that the deictic centre is located where the speaker is.",19
892,Very similar problems arise with the interpretation of the temporal deictic expression ,19
893,Consider the following possible utterances:,19
894,(22),19
895,a.,19
896,Clap altogether NOW.,19
897,(gym mistress to class),19
898,b.,19
899,I think you should begin the next chapter now.,19
900,(supervisor to student),19
901,c.,19
902,Now I'm getting older I really do find policemen look younger.,19
903,d.,19
904,"From the iron age till now, man has been making increasingly complex artefacts.",19
905,"In and the utterances appear to be located within different temporal spans, one relating to the speaker's advancing age (involving a span of 20–30 years) the advancement of man (involving a span of decades and possibly centuries).",19
906,"Utterances and are different the action specified is to follow the utterance, immediately in the case of , but after some expanse of time in .",19
907,"we suggest that the deictic centre is located within the context of utterance by the speaker, but that the interpretation of the expression as relating duratively or subsequently to the utterance, and the time-span involved, must be determined the content of the utterance.",19
908,We should note that this fixing of the deictic centre is particularly appropriate to what Lyons (1977: 637) calls,19
909,"the canonical situation of utterance: this involves one-one, or one-many, signalling in the phonic medium along the vocal-auditory channel, with all the participants present in the same actual situation able to see and to perceive the associated non-vocal paralinguistic features of their utterances, and each assuming the role of sender and receiver in turn.",19
910,"It is, , possible to use the expressions and in what might be described as ‘displaced contexts’.",19
911,"Consider how you would interpret the utterance said by one astronaut to another, on earth, as they study a map of the moon.",19
912,"Or, how you interpret the message on each sheet of one brand of government-issue toilet roll, which reads .",19
913,"Speakers, or writers, do have the option of transferring the deictic centre to the hearer's, or reader's, spatio-temporal situation in which the text will be encountered.",19
914,"From our discussion of the spatio-temporal co-ordinates which seem, in principle, peculiarly accessible to standard specification, it must be obvious first, that deictic expressions may retain a standard deictic centre but must be interpreted the content of the utterance in which they occur and, second, that the relevant standard temporal description of an utterance, 9.22 , will vary the knowledge and intention of the analyst (or speaker) in referring to the utterance as located in time.",19
915,", there were an agreed, standard system for tagging utterances with spatio-temporal features, there is no guarantee that that tagging system provides the relevant information.",19
916,Thus in 2.2.,19
917,I. we discussed a fragment of discourse:,19
918,He seemed to resent them on that occasion and will not wear them today,19
919,where we specified the time of utterance as 4 June 1980.,19
920,The newspaper article from which this fragment was extracted did indeed appear on that date.,19
921,"However, for anyone who knows what the expression means, it would almost certainly have been more informative to tag the time of utterance as , 80.",19
922,The space-time co-ordinates cannot be regarded as simple  unstructured cues to interpretation in context.,19
923,"Similarly, the other co-ordinates relevant to the deictic context,and cannot be regarded as simple unstructured cues which demand standard specification.",19
924,"What does it mean to specify, , the indicated object co-ordinate?",19
925,We could identify a person by name.,19
926,We could report ,19
927,"This might be adequate to identify the speaker, indeed the expression might be sufficient.",19
928,"If, however, you do not know who this person is, or might be, it would be more helpful if we were to give some indication of why we have introduced her into the conversation.",19

930,"Morgan (1975: 442) asks ‘What can we infer about the speaker's intentions from the fact that he has chosen this particular description, any of the others which would call to mind the same referent?’",19

936,"Lyons points out that, , the terms of address used by a social inferior to a social superior may be different from those used between peers, as in vocative terms like ‘Sir’ or ‘Doctor’or ‘My Lord’(in the courtroom).",19

961,Rommetveit (1974: 45) discusses a sentence introduced in Chomsky (1972: 67):,19
962,"I am not against MY FATHER, only against THE LABOR MINISTER",19
963,Rommetveit argues that the sentence is not necessarily self-contradictory the individual referred to by the two nominal expressions is the same individual.,19
964,It merely expresses the ambivalence which is a common human experience where some aspect of an entity pleases you and some other aspect fails to please.,19
965,"Rommetveit argues against ‘the notion of identifying reference as an unequivocally defined point in a monistic and epistemological transparent space, constructed on axiomatic prerequisites for specific operations within formal logic’…where ‘the severe laws of  truth values prescribe that the speaker must know him (the indicated entity) fully or not ’(1974: 48).",19
966,"It is possible for speakers, hearers or indicated entities to be regarded from the perspective of one role.",19

975,It is clear that we can hold partially or severely differing opinions about the same individual in different roles.,19
976,In the following extract from a report in (15 May 1982) the same individual is referred to by a number of different expressions which relate to the multiple roles that the reporter considers relevant to the incident:,19
977,"(25)(Lisbon, May 14)was charged here today with attempting to murder the Pope.",19
978,was arrested after approached the Pope while he was saying prayers at Fatima on Wednesday night.,19

982,We have italicised the expressions relating to the man identified in the headline as ,19
983,"The relevance of his role as priest (referred to by the expressions Priest, a dissident…priest, the priest's) is presumably as a priest of the Roman Catholic Church of which the Pope is Head.",19
984,"Since the incident reported takes place in Portugal and any subsequent prison sentence will be served in Portugal, it is relevant that the priest is not Portuguese ",19
985,"Since the incident reported takes place in Portugal and any subsequent prison sentence will be served in Portugal, it is relevant that the priest is not Portuguese ",19
986,"potentially confusing indefinite referring expression,apparently  relates back to the period before he was identified as ‘a dissident Spanish priest’.",19
987,"He is identified by his name, as an individual, in the set constituted by the intersection of the various relevant roles ",19
988,"As Levy (1979: 193) remarks, ‘the speaker by may not simply identify but may the object by selecting from a field of relations those properties that relevant at the moment of utterance’.",19
989,Consider the response of a five-and-a-half-year-old girl in a Yorkshire infant school where she is asked to say how two pictures are different from .,19
990,She replies:,19
991,(26),19
992,a.,19
993,That one's in but it in't .,19
994,"The teacher then holds the little girl's hands, so she can't point, shuts her own eyes and says to the child:",19
995,b.,19
996,Now I can't see the picture.,19
997,Tell me the difference again.,19
998,This time the child says:,19
999,c.,19
1000,In this picture the teddy's on the chair but there ain't no teddy in that one.,19
1001,"The pictures are identical except in three respects: the presence or absence of a teddy bear sitting on the chair, a difference in the pattern on the counterpane, a difference in the position of a mirror.",19
1002,For the child the teddy bear is clearly the salient object.,19
1003,She relies in her first response on the teacher's access to the shared visual context to interpret what she says.,19
1004,She points to the teddy bear in the first picture and then points to the empty chair in the second picture and assumes that the teacher is paying attention to what she is pointing to in their shared context of situation.,19
1005,"When the teacher inhibits the child from pointing and pretends not to be able to see the picture, the child understands that the communicative situation has changed, that she can rely on the shared visual context and she makes her reference explicit locates him verbally by pointing to him and makes explicit how the second picture differs from the first ",19
1006,"A salient aspect of the addressee, her ability to see what the child can see, has been changed by the utterance of b and the acts accompanying the utterance.",19
1007,"Speakers, hearers and indicated objects are not featureless, colourless spheres.",19
1008,Nor do they come simply tagged with proper names appropriate to all occasions together with one identifying description appropriate to all occasions.,19
1009,"They are, characteristically, endowed with immense numbers of physical and social properties, any one of which may be the property which is relevant to a particular communicative act.",19
1010,"The philosopher's crisp index, which permits the identification of speaker and hearer as X and Y, is only relevant in a restricted model world.",19
1011,"The discourse analyst working in the real world has to be able to extract, see as relevant, just those properties of the features of context which are relevant to the particular communicative act which he is describing, and which contribute to the interpretation (or intended meaning) of the utterance.",19
1012,"As Enkvist (1980: 79) remarks, ‘The context analyst's first embarrassment is richness.’",19
1013,How is he to determine which properties of which features of context are relevant on a particular occasion?,19
1014,Are there general principles to appeal to?,19
1015,"Is it reasonable to assume, as we tend to do, that those features of context which are salient to the speaker are equally salient to the hearer?",19
1016,Ought we not rather to think partially intersecting views of context?,19
1017,"Bar-Hillel (1970: 79) states that ‘the depth of the pragmatic context which is necessary for the full understanding of various sentence-tokens, is different, , from case to case’.",19
1018,we have only a very limited understanding of how we might set about determining ‘the depth of the pragmatic context which is necessary’ for interpretation.,19
1019,We outline a possible approach to the problem in the next section and in Chapter 3.,19
1020,The principles of ‘local interpretation’ and of' analogy',19
1021,In 2.3 we have discussed the problems for the discourse analyst in specifying what aspects of the apparently illimitable features of context are to be taken into account in the interpretation of discourse.,19
1022,How is he to determine the relevant span of time in the interpretation of a particular utterance of ‘now’ or the relevant aspects of a character referred to by the expression ‘John’?,19
1023,"We must assume that the problem for the discourse analyst is, in this case, identical to the problem for the hearer.",19
1024,"There must be principles of interpretation available to the hearer which enable him to determine, , a relevant and reasonable interpretation of an expression ‘John’ on a particular occasion of utterance.",19
1025,One principle which we can identify we shall call the ,19
1026,This principle instructs the hearer not to construct a context any larger than he needs to arrive at an interpretation.,19
1027,Thus if he hears someone say ‘Shut the door’ he will look towards the nearest door available for being shut.,19
1028,"(If that door is shut, he may well say ‘It's shut’, consider what other doors are potentially available for being shut.)",19
1029,"Similarly if his host says ‘Come early’, having just invited him for eight o'clock, he will interpret ‘early’ the last-mentioned time, to some previously mentioned time.",19
1030,Consider again extract (17) presented here as (27).,19
1031,(27) a man,19
1032,and woman sitting in the living room…the man's bored goes to the window looks out the window…and goes out + goes to his goes to a club + has a drink talks to the barman,19
1033,"In our discussion in 2.2.2, we pointed out the effect of ‘co-text’ in limiting the interpretation of what follows.",19
1034,The initial setting of the co-text determines the extent of the context within which the hearer will understand what is said next.,19
1035,"He assumes that entities referred to will remain constant, that the temporal setting will remain constant, that the locational setting will remain constant, unless the speaker indicates some change in any of these, in which case the hearer will minimally expand the context.",19
1036,"Not only does the hearer assume it is the same ‘man’ who is being talked about throughout, he also assumes that the man will stay in the same place unless the speaker announces that he moves.",19
1037,"When the hearer hears he assumes it is ‘the window’ in that same ‘living room’which has already been mentioned, and he assumes that the man ‘goes to the window’on the same occasion, within minutes of the original setting ‘sitting in the living room’.",19
1038,"When the man the hearer assumes that the ‘club’ is in the same town, that the man has not caught an aeroplane and flown to Las Vegas.",19
1039,"Again the minimal expansion of the spatio-temporal setting will suggest that the man and within that same club and on that same occasion, within a restricted time-span, say an hour a year.",19
1040,"It is this principle, which instructs the hearer not to construct a context any larger than necessary to secure an interpretation, which accounts for how we understand Sacks' (1972) much-quoted sequence:",19
1041,(28) The baby cried.,19
1042,The mommy picked it up.,19
1043,"It is possible, , to imagine that the first of these sentences describes one event and the second describes another, quite unrelated, event (so the person identified as ‘a mother’ may be picking up a chair in the course of cleaning a room).",19
1044,"The principle of local interpretation however, will guide us to construct a limited context in which ‘the mother’ is the mentioned baby's mother and the expression used to refer to the previously mentioned baby.",19
1045,Moreover the sequence of events will be understood as happening adjacently in time and situated adjacently in place.,19
1046,It does not even occur to the reader that the baby might have cried one year in Singapore and be picked up by its mother a year later in Aden.,19
1047,"It would, , be possible to establish a setting in which such a sequence of events would be plausible, but, if no such setting is established, the reader will assume a local interpretation time, place and participants.",19
1048,It must be obvious that ‘local interpretation’ may only be vaguely conceptualised.,19
1049,"It seems unlikely that in interpreting (28) the reader postulates any exact physical distance between the mother and the baby at the point before the mother picks the child up, or that he bothers to wonder whether the mother picks the child up after it has finished crying (and if so how long after, minutes or seconds) or whether the child was still crying when the mother picked it up.",19
1050,"Similarly it seems unlikely that the reader will bother to construct a three-dimensional, photographic representation of ‘the baby’ which cries in the first sentence and which is picked up in the second sentence.",19
1051,"‘Local interpretation’ probably relates to another strategy which instructs the hearer /reader to do as little processing as possible, only to construct a representation which is sufficiently specific to permit an interpretation which is adequate for what the hearer judges the purpose of the utterance to be.",19
1052,Everything that we have said so far in this section leans heavily  on the hearer's /reader's ability to utilise his knowledge of the world and his past experience of similar events in interpreting the language which he encounters.,19
1053,It is the experience of similar events which enables him to judge what the purpose of an utterance might be.,19
1054,It is his knowledge of the world which constrains his local interpretation.,19
1055,Consider again (27) presented here as (29).,19
1056,(29) a man and woman sitting in the living room…the man's bored goes to the window…goes out…goes to a club,19
1057,"We suggested that will be interpreted as meaning that ‘he goes to the window in the living room’, whereas will be interpreted as meaning ‘goes to a club in the same town’, i.e. not ‘in the living room’, nor even ‘in the same house’.",19
1058,Knowledge of the world tells us that houses which contain living rooms do not usually contain bars.,19
1059,"cannot be simply interpreted as meaning ‘goes the room’, it has to be interpreted as meaning ‘goes the house’.",19
1060,(In Chapter 7 we return to a discussion of ‘knowledge of the world’.),19
1061,"We must suppose that an individual's experience of past events of a similar kind will equip him with expectations, hypotheses, about what are likely to be relevant aspects of context.",19
1062,"Bartlett, one of the founders of modern psychology, comments on the importance of relating a particular experience to other similar experiences:",19
1063,"it is legitimate to say that all the cognitive processes which have been considered, from perceiving to thinking, are ways in which some fundamental ‘effort after meaning’ seeks expression.",19
1064,"Speaking very broadly, such effort is simply the attempt to .",19
1065,"(1932: 227, our emphasis)",19
1066,"The individual, he suggests, generalises over particular experiences and extracts from these a number of of experience.",19
1067,"This notion is, , implicit in the construction of the sets of features of context which we have been considering in this chapter.",19
1068,to construct a notion of ‘speaker in a context’ it is necessary to generalise over contexts and to determine what characteristics speakers in different contexts share.,19
1069,"Similarly, to construct a notion of ‘genre’, it is necessary to generalise across experience and determine what it is that is common to fairy stories, chats, news  broadcasts, epic poems, debates or salesmen's routines which enables us to recognise one as being a token of the generalised type.",19
1070,"On the basis of experience then, we recognise types of communicative events which take place against the background of a mass of below-conscious expectations also based on past experience which we might summarise, following van Dijk (1977: 99), as ‘the ASSUMED NORMALITY of the world.",19
1071,"We assume that our muscles will continue to move normally, that doors which normally open will continue to open, that hair grows on heads, that dogs bark, that towns retain their geographical locations, that the sun will shine, .",19
1072,It is interesting to observe the powerful constraints on creators of surrealist or science fiction in this respect.,19
1073,"Alice may enter a looking-glass world where unexpected things happen, but she is still constituted like a human being: walking may take her in an unexpected direction, but the nature of the physical act of walking is taken for granted.",19
1074,"If too many expectations are flouted, the writer may be suspected of being mentally unbalanced, of being incapable of seeing the world in a normal way.",19
1075,"Thus, on the one hand, expectations make interpretation possible and, on the other, they constitute an extension or further affirmation of their own validity.",19
1076,"Popper makes the point cogently: ‘we are born with expectations: with ‘knowledge’ which, although not i.e. all observational experience.",19
1077,One of the most important of these expectations is the expectation of finding a regularity.,19
1078,"It is connected with an inborn propensity to look out for regularities, or with a to regularities' (1963: 47, original emphasis).",19
1079,"Furthermore, as Lewis (1969: 38) points out, ‘fortunately we have learned that all of us will mostly notice the same analogies’.",19
1080,"Not only are we all primed to look for regularities, we tend to perceive the same regularities.",19
1081,"Clearly the smaller the community, the more notions of regularity will be shared, since the contexts which the members of the community share will be very similar.",19
1082,"Once the individual begins to establish regularities, to generalise over experience, it becomes possible for him not only to recognise a particular experience as being one of a type, say a scolding or an interview, it also becomes possible to predict what is likely to happen, what are likely to be the relevant features of context, within a particular type of communicative event.",19
1083,It follows that the hearer in a speech situation is not in the position of trying to pay attention to every feature of the context (in principle an impossible task).,19
1084,He only pays attention to those features which have been necessary and relevant in similar situations in the past.,19
1085,Bartlett suggests that the individual has ‘an overmastering tendency simply to get a general impression of the whole; and on the basis of this he constructs the probable detail’(1932: 206).,19
1086,"We pay attention to those salient features which are constitutive of the type of genre, and expect that the peripheral features will be as they have been in the past.",19
1087,Obviously there will be types of occasions which have not occurred within our past experience.,19
1088,"We have cultural stereotypes which suggest that such occasions are difficult for us, potentially embarrassing, because we do not know the appropriate responses.",19
1089,"Thus, if it is the first time someone tells you a particular genre of joke, you may not know the appropriate type of response.",19
1090,"The second time around, however, you feel more confident of what to expect.",19
1091,"(Tolstoy, in gives a brilliant account of the insecurity engendered by the first occasion of a new type of experience in his description of Pierre's induction into membership of a masonic brotherhood.)",19
1092,"Our experience of particular communicative situations teaches us what to expect of that situation, both in a general predictive sense (e.g. the sort of attitudes which are likely to be expressed, the sort of topics which are likely to be raised) which gives rise to notions of ‘appropriacy’, and in a limited predictive sense which enables us to interpret linguistic tokens (e.g. deictic forms like and in the way we have interpreted them before in similar contexts.",19
1093,"We must assume that the young child's acquisition of language comes about in the context of expanding experience, of expanding possible interpretations of forms like and in different contexts of situation, contexts which come to be recognised, and stored as types.",19
1094,"Against the background of this mass of expectations which derives from and constitutes our experience, it must become possible to identify the relevant properties of features of the context of situation norms of expectation within a particular genre.",19
1095,"The more highly constrained and ritualised the genre, the more likely we are to be able to identify norms.",19
1096,"Thus it seems likely  that examination questions in chemical engineering at degree level will bear certain similarities of form and content, and share certain presuppositions, in institutions throughout the world.",19
1097,"The less constrained the genre, primarily interactional ‘chat’, , the less likely it is that we can confidently state norms of expectation which will generalise even over the experience of the English-speaking population.",19
1098,"For the individual participant in a chatting relationship, this does not constitute a difficulty, because he has plenty of previous personal and local experience to call upon.",19
1099,"For the discourse analyst, on the other hand, the more personal and particular the occasion for the participants, the more limited and circumspect he must be in his interpretation.",19
1100,"Confronted with data of the following sort, an extract from a private diary only intended to remind the elderly writer of how she passed a day in January 1982, the discourse analyst may not be able to proceed very far in his analysis.",19

1109,", if the discourse analyst experiences a great deal of data like this, he will feel more confident in his description and interpretation.",19
1110,"He, too, is constrained in his interpretation by past similar experience, by interpreting what we might call the principle of analogy.",19
1111,The principle of analogy will provide a reasonably secure framework for interpretation for the hearer and for the analyst most of the time.,19
1112,"Most of the time, things will indeed conform to our expectations.",19
1113,"However, conventions can be flouted and expectations upset, either deliberately for a stylistic effect, or by accident or oversight.",19
1114,"Note that where the speaker /writer is deliberately flouting a convention, upsetting an expectation for a stylistic effect, he can only bring off that effect because the convention /expectation exists.",19
1115,The ‘non-limerick’ which follows only makes an effect the conventional structure for limericks which have a characteristic rhythm and an rhyme scheme:,19
1116,"(31) There was a young girl of St Bees, Who was stung on the nose by a wasp When asked ‘Does it hurt?’",19
1117,"She replied ‘Yes it does, But I'm glad it wasn't a hornet.’",19
1118,The principle of analogy is one of the fundamental heuristics which hearers and analysts adopt in determining interpretations in context.,19
1119,They assume that everything will remain as it was before unless they are given specific notice that some aspect has changed.,19
1120,Dahl (1976: 46) formulates a principle for speakers: ‘Indicate only things which have changed and omit those which are as they were before.’,19
1121,"To repeat what is known to be shared knowledge, ‘things as they were before’, flouts Grice's maxim of quantity.",19
1122,"(Speakers do, , remind of knowledge which they share, to make that knowledge part of the activated context of discourse, as McCawley (1979) points out.)",19
1123,"Discourse is interpreted past experience of similar discourse, by analogy with previous similar texts (remember the relevance of experience of previous similar texts in the interpretation of (14C) in Chapter 2, SQUASHED INSECTS DONT BITE MAD MENTAL RULE).",19
1124,"Relevant previous experience, together with the principle of local interpretation, will impel hearers /readers to try to interpret sequential utterances as relating to the same topic.",19
1125,"When two sentences are placed together in sequence by a writer who does not want us to consider them as a continuous text, their separateness or disconnectedness must be positively indicated.",19
1126,"In a linguistics textbook, the following two sentences were presented as separate citation examples to illustrate structural ambiguity.",19
1127,(32),19
1128,1.,19
1129,The bride and groom left early last night.,19
1130,2.,19
1131,He greeted the girl with a smile.,19
1132,"(Brown & Miller, 1980: 84)",19
1133,"In the context of a linguistics textbook, one on syntax, we would not expect to have to interpret two continuous cited sentences as describing an event sequence.",19
1134,"In most contexts, however, the natural ‘effort after meaning’ will impel the hearer /reader to try to co-interpret chunks of language which he finds close  to on a page, or a stone or a wall and, where possible, to interpret the language as relevant to the physical context.",19
1135,"This last point leads us to an important, but frequently misunderstood, concept in the analysis of discourse.",19
1136,"The imperative to regularities' which Popper speaks of, coupled with Bartlett's ‘effort after meaning’, constitute a powerful expectation in human beings that what is said or written will make sense in the context in which it appears.",19
1137,"Even in the most unpropitious circumstances, the natural reaction of man appears to be to make sense of any sign resembling language, resembling an effort to communicate.",19
1138,The reaction of the man who finds what are apparently signs etched in a stone in the middle of a desert is to try to decipher their meaning.,19
1139,"The reaction of parents to infants, and of friends to the speech of those who are gravely ill, is to attribute meaning to any murmur which can be interpreted as relevant to the context of situation, and, if possible, to interpret what appears to be being said as constituting a coherent message, permitting the hearer to construct a coherent interpretation.",19
1140,The natural effort of hearers and readers alike is to attribute relevance and coherence to the text they encounter until they are forced not to.,19
1141,"The normal expectation in the construction and interpretation of discourse is, as Grice suggests, that relevance holds, that the speaker is still speaking of the same place and time, participants and topic, unless he marks a change and shows explicitly whether the changed context is, or is not, relevant to what he has been saying previously.",19
1142,Similarly the normal expectation is that the discourse will be coherent.,19
1143,The reaction of some scholars to the question of ‘coherence’ is to search for cues to coherence within the text and this may indeed yield a descriptive account of the characteristics of some types of text.,19
1144,"It ignores, however, the fact that human beings do not require formal textual markers before they are prepared to interpret a text.",19
1145,"They naturally assume coherence, and interpret the text that assumption.",19
1146,"They assume, , that the principles of analogy and local interpretation constrain their experience.",19
1147,There are as many linguistic ‘cues to coherence’(a concept to be discussed in detail in Chapter 6) holding between the pairs of sentences:,19

1150,The bride and groom left early last night.,19

1153,as there are between:,19
1154,(34) The baby cried.,19
1155,The mommy picked it up.,19
1156,It is not the sequence of sentences which represents ‘coherent discourse’.,19
1157,"Rather it is the reader, driven by the principles of analogy and local interpretation, who assumes that the second sequence describes a series of connected events and interprets linguistic cues (like — it) under that assumption.",19
1158,"Encountering the first pair of sentences in the context in which they occur, the reader does not assume that they describe a connected sequence of events and consequently does not interpret the potential linguistic cues (like —) as referring to the same entity.",19
1159,"The principles of analogy (things will tend to be as they were before) and local interpretation (if there is a change, assume it is minimal) form the basis of the assumption of coherence in our experience of life , hence in our experience of discourse .",19

1163,"In the process, we shall explore some recent attempts to construct a theoretical notion of ‘topic’, a notion which seems to be essential to concepts ‘relevance’ and ‘coherence’, but which itself is very difficult to pin down.",19
1164,"We shall suggest that formal attempts to identify topics are doomed to failure, but that the discourse analyst may usefully make appeal to notions like ‘speaking topically’ and ‘the speaker's topic’within a ‘topic framework’.",19
1165,We shall also consider briefly how markers of ‘topic-shift’ may be identified in written and spoken discourse.,19
1166,", we shall insist on the principle that it is speakers and writers who have topics, not texts.",19
1167,We shall then go on to consider how the notion of ‘topic’ relates to representations of discourse content.,19
1168,"Since many of the representations proposed are based on a hierarchical organisation of discourse content, we shall consider critically the possibility of characterising ‘topic’ the top-most elements in the hierarchical representation.",19
1169,Discourse fragments and the notion ‘topic',19
1170,We have already argued that the data used in discourse analysis will inevitably reflect the analyst's particular interests.,19
1171,"Moreover, the piece of data chosen for study can only be partially analysed.",19
1172,"If the investigation is undertaken by someone primarily interested in intonation, , the data selected has to meet certain requirements.",19
1173,"It must be spoken, audible, and, the level of investigation involved, clear enough to allow instrumental analysis, and accompanied by additional information on the age, sex and linguistic background of the speaker.",19
1174,"In  practice, any single investigation will have much stricter data requirements than this rather general list.",19
1175,"Having selected the data, the investigators will study features the pitch, rhythm and loudness of syllables in the data, and spend relatively little or no time studying the lexis or the morphology.",19
1176,"In its most extreme form, this narrowing of the investigation the data selected and the analysis undertaken can lead to a constructed text being carefully read aloud in a phonetics laboratory by a speaker of standard Southern British English.",19
1177,The results of the investigation may then be used to make ‘empirical’ claims about the intonation of English.,19
1178,"Although this is an extreme example, it serves to illustrate the selectiveness which characterises linguistic investigation generally, and which is also present to a certain degree in most analysis of discourse.",19
1179,The data studied in discourse analysis is always a fragment of discourse and the discourse analyst always has to decide where the fragment begins and ends.,19
1180,How does the analyst decide what constitutes a satisfactory unit for analysis?,19
1181,There do exist ways of identifying the boundaries of stretches of discourse which set one chunk of discourse off from the rest.,19
1182,Formulaic expressions ‘Once upon a time…and they lived happily ever after’ can be used explicitly to mark the boundaries of a fragment.,19
1183,"Other familiar markers are ‘Have you heard the one about…?’,",19
1184,‘Did I tell you what happened to me last week.,19
1185,…?’ and various other forms which can be used to mark the beginning of a joke or anecdote.,19
1186,These markers can help the analyst decide where the beginning of a coherent fragment of discourse occurs.,19
1187,"However, speakers often do not provide such explicit guidelines to help the analyst select chunks of discourse for study.",19
1188,"to divide up a lengthy recording of conversational data into chunks which can be investigated in detail, the analyst is often forced to depend on intuitive notions about where one part of a conversation ends and another begins.",19
1189,"There are, , points where one speaker stops and another starts speaking, but every speaker-change does not necessarily terminate a particular coherent fragment of conversation.",19
1190,"Which point of speaker-change, among the many, could be treated as the end of one chunk of the conversation?",19
1191,This type of decision is typically made by appealing to an intuitive notion of ,19
1192,The conversationalists stop talking  about ‘money’ and move on to ‘sex’.,19
1193,"A chunk of conversational discourse, then, can be treated as a unit of some kind because it is on a particular ‘topic’.",19
1194,"The notion of ‘topic’ is clearly an intuitively satisfactory way of describing the unifying principle which makes one stretch of discourse ‘about’something and the next stretch ‘about’something else, for it is appealed to very frequently in the discourse analysis literature.",19
1195,Yet the basis for the identification of ‘topic’ is rarely made explicit.,19
1196,"In fact, ‘topic’ could be described as the most frequently used, unexplained, term in the analysis of discourse.",19
1197,Sentential topic,19
1198,One use of the term ‘topic’ is associated with descriptions of sentence structure.,19
1199,"Hockett, a distinction can be made between the and the in a sentence, ‘the speaker announces a topic and then says something about it…",19
1200,"In English and the familiar languages of Europe, topics are usually also subjects and comments are predicates’(1958: 201).",19
1201,"It is clear from Hockett's examples, reproduced here as (1) and (2), that this ‘sentential topic’ may coincide with the grammatical subject, as in (1), but need not, as in (2).",19
1202,(1) John /ran away,19
1203,(2) That new book by Thomas Guernsey /I haven't read yet,19
1204,"The treatment of ‘topic’ as a grammatical term, identifying a constituent in the structure of a sentence (or the deep structure analysis, ) is also noticeable in the work of grammarians Dahl (1969) and Sgall ",19
1205,(1973).,19
1206,Transformational generative grammars would also account for the structure of example (2) a movement transformation called ‘topicalisation’.,19
1207,"The term ‘topic’, then, as found in descriptions of sentence structure, is essentially a term which identifies a particular sentential constituent.",19
1208,"As such, it has been used in the study of discourse, by Grimes (1975: 337) , to describe the different methods used in various languages to mark the ‘topic constituent’ of sentences.",19
1209,"It has also been used by Givón (1979a) in his argument that, in the development of a language, sentential subjects are derived from ‘grammaticalised topics’.",19
1210,"However, we are not, for the moment, concerned with the structure of linguistic units comparable to the simple sentence (see Chapter 5).",19
1211,Nor are we considering ‘topic’ as a grammatical constituent of any kind.,19
1212,We are primarily interested in the general pretheoretical notion of ‘topic’ as ‘what is being talked about’in a conversation.,19
1213,This type of ‘topic’ is unlikely to be identifiable as one part of a sentence.,19
1214,"Accordingly, we agree with Morgan that ‘it is not sentences that have topics, but speakers’(Morgan, 1975: 434).",19
1215,Discourse topic,19
1216,"In an attempt to distinguish their notion of topic from the grammarians' sentential topic, Keenan & Schieffelin (1976) used the term ",19
1217,"They were particularly anxious to avoid having ‘topic’, in discourse study, treated it were somehow expressible by a simple noun phrase, as often happens in the treatment of sentential topics.",19
1218,"(Some ontological reasons for this type of treatment are suggested by Lyons, 1977: 502.)",19
1219,"What Keenan & Schieffelin (1976: 380) emphasise is that ‘discourse topic is not a simple NP, but a proposition (about which some claim is made or elicited)’.",19
1220,"It may be because their investigation is primarily concerned with children's speech, but, in describing the discourse topic as the ‘question of immediate concern’, Keenan & Schieffelin appear to replace the idea of a single correct noun phrase as expressing the topic with the idea of a single correct phrase or sentence.",19
1221,"The implication in their study is that there must be, for any fragment of conversational discourse, a single proposition (expressed as a phrase or sentence) which represents the discourse topic of the whole of the fragment.",19
1222,"Such a view is certainly too simplistic, as we hope to show by considering some experimental work in which ‘the topic’ was treated as the equivalent of a title.",19
1223,(We shall consider the possibility of representing ‘the discourse topic’ as a proposition when we investigate the proposition-based analysis of discourse in section 3.7.),19
1224,"In a series of experiments reported by Bransford & Johnson (1973) subjects were presented with constructed texts to read, comprehend, and, later, recall.",19
1225,"The aim of the experiments was to demonstrate that the comprehension of English texts depends not only on knowledge of the language, but also on extra-linguistic knowledge, particularly related to the contexts in which the texts  occur.",19
1226,"There are examples of texts which appear to depend on accompanying visual material for comprehension and others, example (3) reproduced below, for which ‘the topic’ must be provided.",19
1227,(3) The procedure is actually quite simple.,19
1228,First you arrange things into different groups.,19
1229,", one pile may be sufficient how much there is to do.",19
1230,"If you have to go somewhere else lack of facilities that is the next step, otherwise you are pretty well set.",19
1231,It is important not to overdo things.,19
1232,", it is better to do too few things than too many.",19
1233,In the short run this may not seem important but complications can easily arise.,19
1234,A mistake can be expensive .,19
1235,the whole procedure will seem complicated.,19
1236,"Soon, however, it will become just another facet of life.",19
1237,"It is difficult to foresee any end to the necessity for this task in the immediate future, but then one never can tell.",19
1238,After the procedure is completed one arranges the materials into different groups again.,19
1239,Then they can be put into their appropriate places.,19
1240,Eventually they will be used and the whole cycle will then have to be repeated.,19
1241,"However, that is part of (from Bransford & Johnson, 1973: 400)",19
1242,"Because it was constructed for a specific purpose, this text is fairly unusual there are few lexical clues to what the text might be ‘about’.",19
1243,"Predictably, the experiments showed that comprehension and recall of this passage were significantly better when subjects were provided, before reading, with what Bransford & Johnson called ‘the topic of the passage’.",19
1244,The topic of this passage was ‘Washing clothes’.,19
1245,The reader can judge for himself whether his comprehension would have been fuller if he had known this topic.,19
1246,"The use of the word ‘topic’ in this type of experiment suggests that the topic of a text is equivalent to the title and that, for any text, there is a single correct expression which is ‘the topic’.",19
1247,"This would be the case if texts could only be understood completely they were accompanied by the single, correct title.",19
1248,"However, it should not be too difficult to imagine several different titles for passage (3), each of which could equally facilitate comprehension.",19
1249,One could indicate that the text contains a set of instructions by producing a title ‘How to Do the Laundry’ or ‘A Guide  to Getting your Clothes Cleaner’.,19
1250,One could incorporate the text's philosophical final statement in a title ‘Doing the Laundry as a Philosophy of Life’ or ‘An Orderly Life through Good Laundry Procedure’.,19
1251,"These latter titles contain as much information for the reader as the title ‘Washing Clothes’, which Bransford & Johnson describe as ‘the topic’.",19
1252,"The implication, surely, is that, for any text, there are a number of possible titles.",19
1253,"Correspondingly, we will suggest, there is, for any text, a number of different ways of expressing ‘the topic’.",19
1254,Each different way of expressing ‘the topic’ will effectively represent a different judgement of what is being written (or talked) about in a text.,19
1255,"As an illustration of this point, consider the text in (3) as a dusty fragment, recovered during an archaeological dig in the ruins of Minneapolis in the year 2500 A.D. When asked what the text is ‘about’, the discourse analyst in the expedition might report that it is about ‘procedures used in mid-twentieth-century American middle-class culture for maintaining cleanliness in their garments’.",19
1256,(Note the temporal and locational elements included here-elements which we shall consider more fully later.),19
1257,"Another discourse analyst, providing a second opinion, might report that it is about something else entirely, and a debate would ensue in the discourse analysis literature.",19
1258,The same ‘text’ is considered by both analysts.,19
1259,Their disagreement would be over ways of expressing ‘the topic’.,19
1260,(Literary critics are still exercised about the topic of .),19
1261,The difficulty of determining a single phrase or sentence as ‘the topic’ of a piece of printed text is increased when fragments of conversational discourse are considered.,19
1262,"In any conversation, ‘what is being talked about’ will be judged differently at different points and the participants themselves may not have identical views of what each is talking about.",19
1263,"People do, however, regularly report on what a conversation was ‘about’.",19
1264,"There are informal ways of expressing the topic, even in conversational discourse.",19
1265,Topic framework,19
1266,"The discourse analyst, then, is faced with several problems when he wishes to use the very attractive pretheoretical notion of ‘topic’ as ‘what is being talked/written about’.",19
1267,The notion is attractive because it seems to be the central organising principle for a lot of discourse.,19
1268,"It may enable the analyst to explain why several  sentences or utterances should be considered together as a set of some kind, separate from another set.",19
1269,"It might also provide a means of distinguishing fragments of discourse which are felt to be good, coherent, examples of English from those that are, intuitively, incoherent concatenations of sentences.",19
1270,"Consider, , the following discourse fragment, taken from Rochester & Martin (1979: 95).",19
1271,(4),19
1272,Interviewer: A stitch in time saves nine.,19
1273,What does that mean?,19
1274,"Thought-disordered Speaker: Oh! that's because all women have a little bit of magic to them — I found that out — and it's called — it's good magic — and nine is a magic number + like I've got nine colors here you will notice — I've got yellow, green, blue, grey, orange, blue, and navy — and I've got black — and I've got a sort of clear white — the nine colors to me they are the whole universe — and they symbolize every man, woman and child in the world +",19
1275,"Rochester & Martin attempt to describe the connections existing between sentences in discourse of this type, produced by thought-disordered and schizophrenic speakers, conceptual associations and lexical ties.",19
1276,"They point out, however, that such connections are ‘unrelated to the conversational topic’.",19
1277,"The notion of ‘topic’, though undefined, seems to provide Rochester & Martin with a natural criterion for distinguishing between the connected, yet incoherent, discourse of thought-disordered speakers and the coherent discourse of normal speakers.",19
1278,"If there are, as we have already argued, a potentially large number of different ways of expressing ‘the topic’ of even a short written text, how does the analyst determine which is the one correct expression of the topic for the text?",19
1279,"One answer, , is to say that, for any practical purposes, there is no such thing as the one correct expression of the topic for any fragment of discourse.",19
1280,There will always be a set of possible expressions of the topic.,19
1281,"In the terms used by Tyler (1978: 452), the ‘topic’ can only be ‘one possible paraphrase’of a sequence of utterances.",19
1282,"What is  required is a characterisation of ‘topic’ which would allow each of the possible expressions, including titles, to be considered (partially) correct, thus incorporating all reasonable judgements of ‘what is being talked about’.",19
1283,We suggest that such a characterisation can be developed a .,19
1284,"In Chapter 2, we discussed the problem for the discourse analyst of deciding just what features of context were relevant in the interpretation of a particular fragment of discourse.",19
1285,"We suggested there that the strategy available to him would be, on the one hand, to work predictively his previous experience (similar speakers, similar genres, etc.) and on the other hand to examine the content of the text.",19
1286,"From the content of the text the analyst can, in principle, determine what aspects of the context are explicitly reflected in the text as the formal record of the utterance.",19
1287,"Those aspects of the context which are directly reflected in the text, and which need to be called upon to interpret the text, we shall refer to as and suggest that they constitute the contextual framework within which the topic is constituted, , the topic framework.",19
1288,"As a way of characterising the type of feature which will be required in a topic framework, we shall examine a fragment of conversational discourse and try to determine what is ‘being talked about’.",19
1289,"The fragment, presented as (5), is not a constructed piece of text, it is taken from a recorded conversation.",19
1290,"As an example of discourse analysis data, it has been selected for a particular purpose.",19
1291,"It is not a difficult fragment to work with, it has a definable beginning and end, and, for most of the fragment, there is one participant talking, another's request for information.",19
1292,"This request for information provides a direction for the conversational fragment, we are considering speech with some purpose and not just social chat used to pass the time.",19
1293,"One might also say that the content of the request for information could provide some basis for the content of the response, especially when the request is for the meaning of an expression to be given.",19
1294,", it would seem, at first glance, to be a simple matter to produce ‘the topic’ for this discourse fragment, for it is contained in the question asked.",19
1295,"Immediately the following extract, the speaker has been asked the meaning of the expression, ‘smoke the houses’.",19
1296,(5),19
1297,R: in those days + when we were young + there was no local fire engine here + it was just a two-wheeled trolley which was kept in the borough + in the borough eh store down on James Street + and whenever a fire broke out + it was just a question of whoever saw the fire first yelling ‘Fire’ + and the nearest people ran for the trolley and how they got on with it goodness knows + nobody was trained in its use + anyway everybody knew to go for the trolley + well + when we were children + we used to use this taw [t–:]+ it smouldered furiously + black thick smoke came from it and we used to get it burning + and then go to a letter box and just keep blowing + open the letter box + and just keep blowing the smoke in + you see + till you'd fill up the lower part of the house with nothing but smoke + there was no fire + but just fill it up with smoke + just to put the breeze up + just as a joke + and then + when somebody would open a window or a door the smoke would come pouring out + and then + everybody was away then for the trolley + we just stood and watched all of them + +,19
1298,S: so that's what ‘smoke the houses’ is?,19
1299,R: probably + probably + we called it ‘the taw’ +,19
1300,"If we were to say that the topic of this discourse fragment is ‘the meaning of the expression ‘smoke the houses’ ', we could not claim to have said very much of analytic interest.",19
1301,"It may be that, for participant S, the above expression represents the best way of summarising what speaker R was talking about, as evidenced by her response.",19
1302,"However, we take that summarising phrase as one possible expression of the topic of speaker R's lengthy contribution, we have surely not adequately characterised what this speaker was ",19
1303,We might suggest that the speaker is talking about or a prank.,19
1304,"In doing so, he talks about an object called ‘the taw’ which produces a lot of ",19
1305,He talks about the process of through the letter box and how the window or door.,19
1306,"He also talks about an object known as a type of fire engine, and associated with its use.",19
1307,He talks about when the smoke comes a house.,19
1308,Thus one account of what this speaker is talking about would contain the following elements: a joke — the taw — smoke — into houses — houses — people get trolley — the use of the trolley.,19
1309,"This set of objects and events could be taken as a set of elements  which would have to be included in a representation of this speaker's topic, i.e. what he was talking about.",19
1310,It is not a complete set.,19
1311,"In this fragment, the speaker is also talking ‘about’ a particular time and place, and ‘about’a specific person.",19
1312,He is talking about his own childhood in Stornoway ,19
1313,"This last element presents a problem, because there is nothing in the text of the conversational fragment to indicate this location.",19
1314,"Yet it is a piece of knowledge relevant to what the speaker is talking about and, importantly, knowledge which the speaker assumes is available, to his hearer.",19
1315,"Presumably, the speaker can also assume that, because his hearer knows, approximately, the speaker's age, the hearer can judge the time (i.e. forty years before and not ten years before) of the events described.",19
1316,Aspects of the speaker's assumptions about his hearer's knowledge must also be considered the elements which the speaker does make explicit in his contribution.,19
1317,Do the first lines of this fragment contribute to answering the question asked?,19
1318,Strictly speaking they do not.,19
1319,Yet one would hesitate to describe these lines as irrelevant.,19
1320,"They are relevant to what the speaker wishes to provide as an answer to the question,he has.",19
1321,"This young American hearer, visiting Stornoway, may have a quite inappropriate idea of the type of object, and the associated behaviour, involved in dealing with a fire in Stornoway forty years before.",19
1322,"Without knowing about the trolley, the hearer may not (in the speaker's assessment perhaps) appreciate the full flavour of the joke or prank being described.",19
1323,It may be argued that this last point has more to do with why the speaker talked about something than with what he talked about.,19
1324,Any consideration of topic involves asking why the speaker said what he said in a particular discourse situation.,19
1325,"As Coulthard (1977: 76), following Sacks (1971), points out, there is a constant analysis in conversation of what is said ‘why that now and to me’.",19
1326,In the present discussion we have already partially answered the reader's primary ‘why’ question about the discourse fragment being studied by providing the previous speaker's question.,19
1327,", attempting to provide an account of what a person is talking about is always built on an assumption that we know why that person says what he says.",19
1328,"The point may be clearer if we consider a possible reaction to the expression, ‘Roses are red, violets  are blue’ being included in (5) after the speaker has said .",19
1329,"Would the expression simply be included in the list of what was talked about, or would it prompt the question ‘Why does he say that here?’",19
1330,The acceptance of extract (5) as a reasonable piece of English conversational discourse involves implicitly assessing each expression the ‘why?’ question above and finding a suitable answer.,19
1331,Part of the process of analysing discourse ‘topic’ is an attempt to make explicit the basis for our intuitive ability to recognise why what is said is appropriate in a particular discourse fragment.,19
1332,Certain elements which constrain the topic can be determined before this discourse begins.,19
1333,"These elements are part of what, in the previous chapter, were described as the context of a speech event.",19
1334,"In relating contextual features to a particular speech event, however, we are particularly interested in only those activated features of context the fragment of discourse being studied.",19
1335,", aspects of the time and place of the discourse in (5) are important because they have a bearing on what the speaker says in the fragment (forty years after the described event took place, but still in Stornoway).",19
1336,"Similarly, certain facts about the speaker and hearer, as we pointed out earlier, have to be included.",19
1337,"As a first approximation, then, we could produce a partial representation of a ‘framework’ for extract (5) the following set of activated contextual features.",19
1338,"Conversation between Participant R (50+ years, Scottish, male,…) and Participant S (20+ years, American, female,…) in location p (Stornoway,…) at time t (late 1970s,…)",19
1339,"This simple set of features which we have claimed are necessary for a discussion of topic are required, quite independently of topic considerations, in any form of discourse analysis.",19
1340,"For ethnographers and sociolinguists considering linguistic interaction, these elements and others have to be made explicit in the analysis of features code-switching and role-relationships.",19
1341,"For the formal semanticist, these elements are required in the assignment of values to indexicals I, you,and ",19
1342,", in building a framework for the analysis of topic, we are not adding  any machinery to the apparatus of the discourse analyst which he does not have to employ already.",19
1343,"Those contextual features we have described above are, , derived from the physical context.",19
1344,They are external to the text.,19
1345,"There is, for most conversational fragments, a set of discourse-internal elements which are derived from the conversation the particular fragment being studied.",19
1346,These elements are introduced in the preceding co-text and form part of what has been described as ‘the domain of discourse’(cf.,19
1347,"Karttunen, 1974).",19
1348,"Within the domain of a particular discourse fragment are the people, places, entities, events, facts, etc. already activated for both participants because they have been mentioned in the preceding conversation.",19
1349,"If the fragment of discourse one wished to study was only the part of (5) beginning,then accounting for the speaker's mention of near the end of this fragment would have to be done the preceding discourse (i.e. all the first section before mentioned) in which introduced and characterised.",19
1350,We have introduced some basic components which would be required in a characterisation of the topic framework for any discourse fragment.,19
1351,The topic framework consists of elements derivable from the physical context and from the discourse domain of any discourse fragment.,19
1352,"Notice that we have concentrated on only those elements which are , , relevant to the interpretation of what is said.",19
1353,"If we say that characterising the topic framework is a means of making explicit some of the assumptions a speaker can make about his hearer's knowledge, we are not talking about the knowledge which the speaker believes he shares with his hearer.",19
1354,We are describing only that activated part which is required in the analysis of the discourse fragment under consideration.,19
1355,This approach is crucially different from some other proposals we shall examine.,19
1356,Presupposition pools,19
1357,"What we have described as a has much Venneman's proposal that, for a discourse, there is a which contains information ‘constituted from general knowledge, from the situative context of the discourse, and from the completed part of the discourse itself’(Venneman, 1975: 314).",19
1358,"In this approach, each participant in a discourse has a presupposition pool and his pool is added to as the discourse proceeds.",19
1359,Each participant also behaves there exists only one presupposition pool shared by all participants in the discourse.,19
1360,"Venneman emphasises that this is true in ‘a normal, honest discourse’.",19
1361,"Within the presupposition pool for any discourse, there is a set of and each discourse is, in a sense, about its discourse subjects.",19
1362,"Because it is part of the shared assumptions of the discourse participants that these discourse subjects exist, they do not need to have their existence asserted in the discourse.",19
1363,"Examples of expressions used for discourse subjects might be (in the presupposition pool by virtue of general knowledge),(from the situative context) and (from the preceding part of the text of the discourse).",19
1364,"The number of discourse subjects in a presupposition pool shared by participants in a discourse, particularly participants who know quite well, is potentially very large.",19
1365,How does the discourse analyst decide which discourse subjects to include in the presupposition pool for a particular piece of conversational discourse?,19
1366,"Remembering that any discourse data to which the analyst has access will only be a fragment, it would be extremely difficult for the analyst to predetermine the complete set of discourse subjects which participants share a particular discourse fragment.",19
1367,The most he could hope to provide would be a partial set.,19
1368,"The problem to be faced is that of limiting the choice of the contents of even a partial set, in some non-arbitrary way.",19
1369,The most important principle involved in this selection of Venneman's discourse subjects must have to do with their relevance to the particular discourse fragment under consideration.,19
1370,"If, in a stretch of conversational discourse, the participants involved can be independently known to have potential discourse subjects ‘the Queen’, ‘the Pope’, or even ‘the King of Siam’, within their shared presupposition pool, but do not mention the individuals, so identified, in their conversation, it is surely unnecessary to refer to those individuals in the analysis of that particular discourse fragment They are, in our terms, not ‘activated’.",19
1371,This would lead to the conclusion that the relevant ‘discourse subjects’ for a particular  discourse fragment must be those to which reference is made in the text of the discourse.,19
1372,"If ‘mentioned-in-the-text’ is taken as the basis for selection of discourse subjects, it should be noted that the analyst is, in fact, attempting to reconstitute the presupposition pool which the participants must have had the discourse fragment being analysed.",19
1373,"Such a process may be comparable to the experience one has when switching on the radio in the middle of a discussion programme and trying to understand the discussion through a partial reconstruction of what must have been said already, who the participants must be, .",19
1374,It does suggest that the only information the discourse analyst has access to is that contained in the text of a discourse fragment.,19
1375,Sentential topic and the presupposition pool,19
1376,", the data for discourse analysis is not limited to anonymous, decontextualised texts, as we have argued already in Chapter 2.",19
1377,"Concentrating solely on the text, however, remains a common approach in many accounts of discourse.",19
1378,It is also characteristic of this approach that the text to be analysed is constructed by the analyst to illustrate the points he wishes to make.,19
1379,"This, unfortunately, is the method used by Venneman who, despite the promising breadth of analysis suggested by the concept of a presupposition pool shared by participants, restricts his investigation to describing the relationship between pairs of sentences.",19
1380,The notion of ‘topic’ considered by Venneman reflects the limitations of his investigation.,19
1381,He considers,19
1382,the expression ‘topic’ or ‘topic of a discourse’as referring to a discourse subject on which the attention of the participants of the discourse is concentrated.,19
1383,"Such concentration of attention is usually, though not always, brought about by an immediately preceding textual mentioning of the discourse subject.",19
1384,"(Venneman, 1975 317)",19
1385,"This definition of topic has a certain intuitive appeal, in the sense that what two participants are concentrating on, in their conversational talk , is a reasonable candidate for ‘the topic’.",19
1386,"There are, however, two basic problems here.",19
1387,"First, this definition of topic seems to be based on the same ‘topic = single term title’ notion which we challenged earlier.",19
1388,"As we pointed out then, although a stretch of discourse can appear to be largely concerned  with a single individual, or one discourse subject, the discourse may be loosely reported as being ‘about’ that individual, this should not lead us to claim that all discourses are about single individuals or can be given convenient one-word titles.",19
1389,"A second objection is that it is clear how we would decide, in any principled way, what the participants in a discourse fragment are, in fact, ‘concentrating’ on.",19
1390,An attempt is made by Venneman to provide a formal means of identifying the topic in a discourse fragment.,19
1391,"He suggests that like ‘all phenomena whose unique existence is presupposed, topics can be referred to by means of individual names, deictic expressions, and definite descriptions’(Venneman, 1975: 317).",19
1392,"Using this guide, the analyst must find that the following two discourse fragments, one each from stretches of spoken and written discourse, have several such ‘topics’.",19
1393,(6) what was interesting was that little Richard came home from his Toronto school with his Newfie jokes the content of which the substantive content was identical to Irish jokes which my son comes home with from Edinburgh schools,19
1394,"(7) so can he, but the main point about this system is the strain it puts on the other players",19
1395,"What is ‘the topic’ of (6)—or or , etc.; and is or the topic of (7)?",19
1396,"It is possible to make a guess at what the speaker of (6) and the writer of (7) were concentrating on, but the guess is probably based on an elaborate reconstruction of what the most probable context was, both verbal and non-verbal, for these two discourse fragments.",19
1397,", the reader will be forced to use these ‘texts’ to reconstruct, not just some relevant discourse subjects in the presupposition pool, following Venneman, but rather some of the elements of the topic framework existing when these discourse fragments were produced.",19
1398,"It is also likely that the reader, if asked to give the topic for each fragment, would not simply produce a single-term ‘title’.",19
1399,"If the same reader were faced with the type of ‘discourse’ fragment created by Venneman, reproduced as (8) below, he might quite readily provide support for Venneman's analysis by saying that ‘the topic’is .",19
