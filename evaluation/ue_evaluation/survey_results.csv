Many words couldn't find a definition, probably because they were vocalised hesitations (Like ""Er""). Overall I felt like the corpus about conversations was not very suitable for learning.

Also, when the score is given, I have no idea what it represents (is that % ?)

Also, does the exercise about sentences end ? I gave up because there was no quit Button, and I didn't know if it would ever stop.",

Overall, I found it to be an excellent bot for vocabulary improvement :) ","I've been told the app is in beta, which is fine. The app seems to be on the right track, and the things I mention will probably already be on the development list. I would first diversify and expand the definitions of some words, for example, some abbreviations (CBE for example) aren't explained, yet are part of the vocabulary expanding texts, including these definitions. Expanding the range of texts should also be a priority; the fiction option is empty.  ","I have the impression that this app was developed for people with a medium level of English, however, if that were not the case, and the app were aimed at people with lower English levels; I would try to simplify the language used by the chat-bot. People with lower levels of English may not be able to understand the instructions fully. 

During the test, I found that the ""correct/wrong answer"" messages and the next word messages would appear one after the other really quickly and it would take a moment to adjust my gaze and discern what was on screen. 

I'm pretty sure the text selection is based on the vocabulary score, however I think that mentioning that explicitly before the test begins would be a welcome addition."

","You should make sure that a definition is available for every word that appears in the included texts. The definition lookup for words next to a single quote (e.g. 'This) seems to be failing. I was interested in the Fiction and Conversation categories, but they were empty. You should either add at least one text to each category or hide the empty ones.

I believe it is a great way to get valid answers, to measure my knowledge and It seemed like a game so I didn't feel like cheating by googling the words! 
2) It is really interesting that the chatbot provides a feedback in the form of score on my vocabulary test.
3) I liked the idea of providing texts related to my preferences. There is great potential if you can add more texts or subcategories. 
4) I liked that definitions and prononciation option are provided.","1) I believe that the feedback form needs to be updated. It almost feels like the questions are the guidelines the students had to follow for the app development. 
It is not easy to understand what you meant with each question. I believe it would be important to evaluate my feelings, thoughts, usage of the app etch. 
2) I believe it would be great if you provided a short description attached to the feedback presenting your team, your project, the approach you had when developing the app. 
3) It is not clear whether there is a third part to this learning game. The bot informs me on my progress in the first set of questions but there is no flow in the second one. 
4) It is not clear as to how the app will help me develop my vocabulary.","1) Many definitions were not provided.
2) I liked the idea of the chatbot reading out loud and spelling the word I wasn't familiar with. However, after listening to the prononciacion of the word the bot would also read all the previous ones I had asked for a definition. I found that would distract me from paying attention to the flow of the conversation.
3) The provided texts were not sufficient. I was interested in academic essays and journals. It felt like you didn't exclude certain words so the bot would give me names of authors, page numbers etch. Which were not helpful for my learning. 
4) After choosing my preferred reading scenario I couldn't change my preference. "
